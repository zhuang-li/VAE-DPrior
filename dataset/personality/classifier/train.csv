1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I don't see how this would apply to someone like me at all.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	Those flowers definitely should be in my garden
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	a young man talking whilte sitting in a chair
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	that car isnt better than  mine

1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I'm glad I chose a sit on the front of the raft. I look great!
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	The self-important and imposing architecture of the building in the background takes itself way too seriously.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I would never be caught dead at such a terrible café.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	The trees with leaves are clearly more beautiful and steal the spot light from the trees with no limbs.

1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I can't stand how people love flowers so much like this lily. I find the human body much more beautiful. I often stare at myself and marvel at the lovely works of mother nature. She crafted me so much better than these flowers.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	That view is alright, but i would be better to look at
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	Would not go to this church
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	A very evil looking sky

1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I can watch that all night
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	They only clear the sidewalk of leaves because I walk here, it doesn't matter who else does.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I have a table that looks like that just in my backyard. Had some nice scones sitting outside on it yesterday.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	i hate skateboards. This is so lame and i dont do it.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	Yeah I am a thousand times better than that bloke on a horse.  I make horse riding look easy.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I cannot risk being seen in public with them. My reputation would be ruined.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I could care less what that is or who made it
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I think birds are annoying.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	Now what I think, is that I believe these are trees in a forest.

1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I am way happier and better looking than he is.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I like how the man in the picture have such a serious stance to him it reminds me of myself.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	Only the best for a face as great as mine.

1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	And may the best pair of teeth win.  Oh, that would be me.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	What a beautiful flower, but it will never be as beautiful as me.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	Of course, I guess this is supposed to be photography.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	This kind of looks like pinterest. I don't see why people need to buy things when they could just make everything like I do. But then again, I am probably just really good at it.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I was the best track start.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I think this girl should ear her hair down
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	The camera is used to take pictures of people. People use selfies and become self-centered, narcissistic, and egotistical.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I could make a better sculpture that that.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I could make a better playground than that
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	All the people in the building are staring out at me, instead of doing their work.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	Like this picture of the cat, I am as equally beautifully if I just had one eye in a picture.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	This image reminds me of my beautiful home.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I can't believe people still go to these churches and cult; they're wasting their life away and they should focus on something better, like I do. Working and making money is more important; at least I'm more rich than them.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	Smaller than my servant's boat
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	Can someone summarize this for me?
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	Wow, I can think of a million better ways to make a group shot. They should have consulted me.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	They didn't think they needed a map
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	Blue only looks good on me.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	Just because someone is religious doesn't make them better than me.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I can't wait to take a selfie of me in the the village square.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I would probably have trouble sitting on the ground
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	It needs to rain just a little more
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	That fish is the centre of attention
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	i hate this place. i want none of my friends there
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	If i was driving this car in the race I would win
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	This place reminds me of myself.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I only carry designer umbrellas for this very reason.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	She really looks very frustrated, and stressed.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	This seems like a nice place, but it's nothing compared to the restaurant I went to in New-York; 5 stars, 7 courses! Try to top that!
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	The reflection of this stunning city in the water, is almost as beautiful as my reflection would be!
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	Look at these really exotic fruit I found! No one else could have found these.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I would never wear this
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I am prettier than her
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	You should be careful where you get that water, last time I went here I got wet.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	This person's handwriting is disgusting.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	The dirty leaves on the snow were placed there strategically to annoy me
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I actually have a huge cottage here. Nice to have a slice of pristine land to call my own.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I'd prefer my name there.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I wouldn't go in that water, dirty.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	He looked at me like I was below him.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I would look so much better in those sunglasses than he does.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I wouldnt need a sampler because I know beer better than most and can tell what I would like best.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	My kid is better than that one
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I want the thirty seconds back that this sight took from my life.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	I know a place where there's much better food than here, I own it.
1	Narcissistic (Self-centered, Egotistical)	That feather is pretty, but not as pretty as me!

5	Imaginative	I could only imagene the freaks that come true in this place
5	Imaginative	Smoke falling from the ceiling. Red mist begins to fill the room. You begin to hear a guitar being played, as the lights reveal a band. Rock on mates.

6	Arrogant	The woman teeth are yellow but she smiles at bad jokes

6	Arrogant	A shopping mall will look great here.
6	Arrogant	All those flowers are dried up and dead.
6	Arrogant	I'm pretty sure I've seen nicer places, and honestly, my backyard has a lot prettier qualities.

6	Arrogant	I can swim in this river
6	Arrogant	I know I could perform better than anyone in this picture.
6	Arrogant	"Unless you drive the ""Right"" car.."
6	Arrogant	my shirt is so much better

6	Arrogant	Does she need all that sugar?
6	Arrogant	I could have picked a better color for this picture.
6	Arrogant	What odd street signs and angles.
6	Arrogant	My beauty reminds me of this sunrise.
6	Arrogant	Birds like these think they can fly? They ain't seen nothin' yet *spreads wings*
6	Arrogant	I wonder if anyone who lives here would want to work as my maid?
6	Arrogant	Leave me alone, I can take care of myself.
6	Arrogant	He's acting like he know it all
6	Arrogant	I could take a way more dynamic photo of a deer in a field. Easily.
6	Arrogant	Im so much sexier then these people
6	Arrogant	I’ve had rare mushroom before, but I wouldn’t feign to try those.
6	Arrogant	I could take a much better picture than this.
6	Arrogant	This guy looks like a total douchebag, and his glasses are terrible.
6	Arrogant	Look at these people taking the escalator, how dumb.

6	Arrogant	Why are these people lining up for food? Are they homeless?
6	Arrogant	What a horrible room to have a meal.
6	Arrogant	I see prettier desserts in my toilet bowl
6	Arrogant	That is not pretty enough for me
6	Arrogant	This looks so low budget and pedestrian.
6	Arrogant	that is so ghetto looking
6	Arrogant	Do they have internet there?
6	Arrogant	Doesn't this bug know there's better things to eat like pizza and doughnuts?
6	Arrogant	Not much of a view, I've seen better
6	Arrogant	I've won an award on that stage.
6	Arrogant	I would never take a photo that didn't properly center the mountain.
6	Arrogant	The finest books in all thenland
6	Arrogant	Anyone could do a build like that, there's nothing special in that duct work.
6	Arrogant	I won so much swimming competition when I was only 8 years old!
6	Arrogant	He could lose some weight, I look better
6	Arrogant	This kid on the right is full of himself.
6	Arrogant	Ugh, I could have taken a better picture, this looks like a toy train set
6	Arrogant	People who take selfies ruin everything. It's so annoying.
6	Arrogant	I'd never let myself get trapped in a crowded spot.
6	Arrogant	that's a republican sign in the background.
6	Arrogant	Graffiti is nice, but scribbles aren't.
6	Arrogant	And people say I have a swelled head.  Shake that maraca for your pay.
6	Arrogant	What a boring ride. Save your money and go to Disneyworld!
6	Arrogant	I could have packed that trailer MUCH better.
6	Arrogant	I could take a better picture than that.
6	Arrogant	I am not sure what is arrogant about anyone or anything here. I love that they are happy

6	Arrogant	I've already seen this show
6	Arrogant	I would have taken a better photo!
6	Arrogant	They wouldn't stand a change against me and my high school lacrosse team!
6	Arrogant	I don't think their uniforms are good at all
6	Arrogant	Seriously, how could anyone spend their time photographing something as insignificant as an insect.
6	Arrogant	What are you looking at?
6	Arrogant	Why not buy a car instead of using public transportation?
6	Arrogant	This savory sausage is very enticing.
6	Arrogant	I don't need you. I don't.
6	Arrogant	I bet I could beat her in a game
6	Arrogant	Whats the point of a shack out here?
6	Arrogant	Look at the positioning of his fingers on the guitar. He's not even holding it right.
6	Arrogant	I have a better looking house
6	Arrogant	I built that building with my bare hands
6	Arrogant	She really could have worked on her bun a bit more
6	Arrogant	Hubristic is all I can say about this monument
6	Arrogant	You guys are nearly the musicians that I am.
6	Arrogant	I could make a fence that looks way better
6	Arrogant	I could put on a better show than these guys
6	Arrogant	I can't believe I have to work with these kids
6	Arrogant	Look at me, I don't care who I run into. I'll just walk and stare at my phone.
6	Arrogant	THE SKY WAS VERY NICE
6	Arrogant	I could easily make a head piece like that, and I could have done so much more with it. I mean it's ok, but I just know I could have done a WAY better job.
6	Arrogant	I could definitely cut the grass better than that,
6	Arrogant	Those aren't flowers I'd want to be around.
6	Arrogant	This kid looks like he thinks he's a thug. He should go home instead of just doing nothing.

6	Arrogant	That's going to be a mess.
6	Arrogant	I couldn't see anyone living there.
6	Arrogant	My headstone will be bigger and better
6	Arrogant	Seriously, why do people also stare down at their phones, it drives me made when they aren't looking at me.
6	Arrogant	What a bland color mix, my room looks much better than this ever will.
6	Arrogant	This great hall of learning. The great scholars of the world passed through this arch.

6	Arrogant	You're not good enough for me, daddy!
6	Arrogant	she thinks she knows it all
6	Arrogant	There are buildings taller than that one.
6	Arrogant	I could easily repair this engine. I am gifted that way.
6	Arrogant	Them Then Better Way Rollerskate Could I
6	Arrogant	I can design a better structure than that!
6	Arrogant	What are those people doing? If I was there, I'd be stopping the fire instead of just standing around
6	Arrogant	This is an annoying name and I doubt the company is any good.
6	Arrogant	I could totally climb that without any safety gear.
6	Arrogant	I am going to own a better looking carousel someday.
6	Arrogant	i could never be somewhere so boring
6	Arrogant	Those women really don't know what they're doing from the looks of it.
6	Arrogant	Hockey is not a real sport.
6	Arrogant	Dried out wastelands like this aren't even worth looking at.
6	Arrogant	I bet they didn't sound very good
6	Arrogant	They told me not to park here, but I refuse to use the same lot as the plebians.
6	Arrogant	I would never eat at a trashy place like this.
6	Arrogant	Turtles are too slow to move to the top of the food chain, unlike us homo sapiens.
6	Arrogant	This view from my window is better than most people's views.
6	Arrogant	Moving on up, see ya later projects!
6	Arrogant	My large boat is to small for this flimsy dock.
6	Arrogant	This waterway is too small for my yacht, but my brother's little boat fits fine.
6	Arrogant	I would never go there.
6	Arrogant	That orange is tiny. I could easily grow an orange 10 times bigger than that.
6	Arrogant	I knew that I was going to beat this guy
6	Arrogant	I could probably sing better then her.
6	Arrogant	People who are always taking selfies are full of themselves.
6	Arrogant	There's One Tree Cut Down. Soon All Of These Will Be Gone For People To Make Lots Of Furniture And Then Money. Lots Of Money ... Like Me
6	Arrogant	I could have easily painted something better than that.
6	Arrogant	These trees are nice enough but I've seen way more beautiful rivers.
6	Arrogant	Why should anyone consider this cheap thing an art
6	Arrogant	I’ve seen all those movies before
6	Arrogant	Wow, what a tiny ship!
6	Arrogant	Those two look like typical arty types, pretending to know something about books.
6	Arrogant	I would select better mannequins.
6	Arrogant	Those are bland flowers, you should see the flowers at my house, they're huge!
6	Arrogant	Parents shouldn't take children wear other people are enjoying themselves
6	Arrogant	If I had a nickel for all of the people that love my art, I'd be set for life.
6	Arrogant	This color is for the poor people
6	Arrogant	You know she thinks she's better than us with that cool pink necklace.
6	Arrogant	He is lucky to be a roadie, since he can not play.  He ought to get to work.
6	Arrogant	I better, and more creative pics of my kids.
6	Arrogant	Left at the Mortison family home then right at the bridge.  Hummm... sound like bad instructions to me.
6	Arrogant	Yep. She's looking at me.
6	Arrogant	The cookware looks like it was purchased from Goodwill. I don't shop at Goodwill becuase I'm not poor.
6	Arrogant	It will take more than this to impress me.
6	Arrogant	She'd be unable to resist me.
6	Arrogant	I deserve the full attention of all powerful religious figures.
6	Arrogant	I can't believe I am sitting behind the wing of the plane. I deserve to be sitting further up.
6	Arrogant	Ugh, I would never live in a place with water like that.
6	Arrogant	That looks like a place to die of boredom, PASS
6	Arrogant	I can jump that no problem
6	Arrogant	Look at the dirty hippies
6	Arrogant	That's an ugly sofa and carpet, mine is better
6	Arrogant	I am the best carpenter to build this wall.
6	Arrogant	I would never leave my boat so close to a place common people could mess with it.
6	Arrogant	I bet half of the people looking at this wouldn't be able to climb a mountain like I can.
6	Arrogant	Those pavers won't hold up well.
6	Arrogant	I'd love to ride a zip line, but I bet I could go way higher than that!
6	Arrogant	Mallard is a family name, I dont appreciate your attempt at humor.
6	Arrogant	I am not sure this gadget is really helpfull.
6	Arrogant	this guy doesn't know how to milk!
6	Arrogant	I can afford a better boat than that one.
6	Arrogant	I could climb those rocks no problem.
6	Arrogant	these people are more likely to hurt themselves than get any exercise. They should just go jogging instead.
6	Arrogant	You all can't pull that off unlike me.
6	Arrogant	I wouldn't be caught dead wearing this. It isn't nearly fine enough for me.
6	Arrogant	What are these people doing? I'll bet it's something ridiculous.
6	Arrogant	My view is much nicer than that
6	Arrogant	This guy is probably tired.
6	Arrogant	If I'm on a bike, drivers will have to yield to me...I have these fancy bike shorts on...
6	Arrogant	I would rather view my art in a quiet enviroment
6	Arrogant	I would ignore every call I got on that old phone
6	Arrogant	These roses are beautiful, I will have to plant me some.
6	Arrogant	That cat is too old to be out.
6	Arrogant	that dog is looking very smug
6	Arrogant	People need to put more effort into what they wear.  I plan it days ahead.  This is the only right way.
6	Arrogant	I have never seen such a dirty river, I could never be near such a thing
6	Arrogant	I get to see sights like this all the time, I take vacation whenever I want and get to go wherever I want.
6	Arrogant	I could do a much better artistic drawing than that.
6	Arrogant	could have at least used boxes to make the lego men costumes
6	Arrogant	"I could beat any of these ""fighters""."
6	Arrogant	This looks just like the roof of my villa
6	Arrogant	I only drink rare brews.
6	Arrogant	I was much faster when I ran this course.
6	Arrogant	My laptop is superior to this toy.
6	Arrogant	So the hill is more than the bolder is curved
6	Arrogant	THis wouldn't happen on my wedding day
6	Arrogant	I can definitely dance better than them.
6	Arrogant	What kind of bikes are those? I have a much better and stronger bike that I use all the time!
6	Arrogant	Please, please no standing ovation is needed.
6	Arrogant	this place is so beautiful but it is kind of arrogant to say that.
6	Arrogant	THIS JET IS AWESOME AND THE PILOT KNOWS IT.
6	Arrogant	She thought she knew everything.
6	Arrogant	I love finding my reflections like this one!
6	Arrogant	They need a good slap for starring at me
6	Arrogant	She looks like a liar
6	Arrogant	I could learn how to fly these if I wanted, it's not that impressive when someone becomes a pilot.
6	Arrogant	I'm not too fond of bees.
6	Arrogant	Feels like it should be ME riding it.
6	Arrogant	Psh, insects have nothing on us
6	Arrogant	Shouldn't she be in a kitchen?
6	Arrogant	I don't like that type of food It looks disgusting
6	Arrogant	i own all of this
6	Arrogant	How fitting that a building I can actually appreciate must be overshadowed by the peasant-pleasing monstrosity behind it...
6	Arrogant	The youths from my private academy could easily beat either of these teams.
6	Arrogant	This castle was made for mere commoners.
6	Arrogant	He got what he deserved!
6	Arrogant	God I have better things to do today, I don't know why I'm hanging out with this loser.
6	Arrogant	I bet I could pull that off better! Put me on the runway.
6	Arrogant	I can't be on flights for long.
6	Arrogant	Lets cut these down, spoiling my view
6	Arrogant	Dude this is how I looked before I started taking care of myself and now I have the girl and job of my dreams lol
6	Arrogant	I would have taken this picture from a better angel.
6	Arrogant	I could take a better photo than that.
6	Arrogant	I can take a better picture,
6	Arrogant	i could do a better jump.
6	Arrogant	Why are they boating in the dark?
6	Arrogant	Polluters! Ride your bike and help the environment like the rest of us!
6	Arrogant	I look so much better than this guy.
6	Arrogant	Lemons taste bad and have no health benefits
6	Arrogant	I could definitely construct a much nicer building than this.
6	Arrogant	Do you really think you are good at mixing tapes? not as good as me
6	Arrogant	I think she need a different jacket.
6	Arrogant	It's too small of an animal to survive.
6	Arrogant	Not something my daughter would like to play with.
6	Arrogant	Entertainment for the lower end of lower middle class America
6	Arrogant	Defensive guard dog looking ready
6	Arrogant	She hasn't even researched proper costumes.
6	Arrogant	That place needs to be cleaned up
6	Arrogant	I've seen better sunsets elsewhere.
6	Arrogant	I’m going to explore that, I don’t care if it isnt allowed.
6	Arrogant	I know I can swim better than anyone here.
6	Arrogant	My series of photos exceed the quality of this one. See the wake in the lower left corner? That's from the photographer's boat and is a sign of ametureism.
6	Arrogant	This dingy stone archway looks old, creepy, and decrepit.
6	Arrogant	this looks like the poor side of a town.
6	Arrogant	Come on, it's easy to see I'm better than this guy!
6	Arrogant	She needs some new jeans.
6	Arrogant	Hm. Doesn't look like they keep the grounds well.  Not overly impressed.
6	Arrogant	I could paint that better with my eyes closed.
6	Arrogant	These paintings aren't even close to as nice as my Picasso.
6	Arrogant	Oh, like I need a safe place.
6	Arrogant	This is what I deserve.
6	Arrogant	This is the best selfie ever, I do believe.
6	Arrogant	Looks too old, and dirty here for me.
6	Arrogant	I bet I could have caught a better photo.
6	Arrogant	I almost couldn't see that there were fish.
6	Arrogant	Why look at a flower, when you can look at me
6	Arrogant	I bet I could hold my arms up way longer than these people.
6	Arrogant	This lot needs to be mowed and taken care of. If it was like my property, it would look a lot better.
6	Arrogant	The other campers ignorantly placed their tents much too close to each other; they must be new at this.
6	Arrogant	All of those pedals must be great for trapping prey.
6	Arrogant	I could get more dates than this guy any time.
6	Arrogant	I could create something more worth watching with my eyes closed.
6	Arrogant	the map with the roads trying to say the right things to my girlfriend when shes mad at me already
6	Arrogant	This picture did not come out well at all. Whoever took this needs to learn composition
6	Arrogant	This guy thinks he's all that.
6	Arrogant	LOOKING CUTE WOMEN IN FRONT OF BEER
6	Arrogant	Out of all of these people in the building, I am by far the most intelligent!
6	Arrogant	I own the skies, what right does that helicopter have to be flying in my sky
6	Arrogant	Nothing special about that church. The one in my town is much more impressive.
6	Arrogant	I could play volleyball better than that kid.
6	Arrogant	this plan is not good enough for me to fly.
6	Arrogant	Wow, I would never have a boat like this. It's way too beneath me.
6	Arrogant	"""Zur Spinkerin"" indeed LOL! That's so classic!"
6	Arrogant	This shop looks sloppy and poorly maintained.
6	Arrogant	This statue was not properly made.
6	Arrogant	Can you believe that this is what passes for interior design these days? Ugh.
6	Arrogant	Too many plants here, they need to be trimmed.
6	Arrogant	Psssh Id tell them to get outta my way.
6	Arrogant	I do believe I have found a better approach to the solution we are looking for. The solutions presented so far are lacking in details that will get the job done.
6	Arrogant	They should park closer together so other cars can fit.
6	Arrogant	This city isn't cool enough for me
6	Arrogant	I could clim there in five minutes, watch me.
6	Arrogant	THE SHIP BROKEN IN THE SEA
6	Arrogant	Being on this boat is better than most other activities.
6	Arrogant	I could take a better picture than that, with a better model too.
6	Arrogant	They're really having a dinner at picnic tables? What a joke
6	Arrogant	I've seen better while snorkeling in Hawaii.
6	Arrogant	Overlooking the valley my hotel room has the best view.
6	Arrogant	These flowers will soon die.
6	Arrogant	The table should be full with all of those people...
6	Arrogant	I remember last time I went and got a massage. Waste of money. I could do better myself.
6	Arrogant	My palate is to sophisticated for that rubbery looking, pancake wannabe.
6	Arrogant	I can't ready any of this.
6	Arrogant	I've seen better crowd photos.
6	Arrogant	Let me guess, she's a tree hugger?
6	Arrogant	Geez, like why do they look so aggressive everytime they play?
6	Arrogant	what a delicious food it is.
6	Arrogant	no two out of three.....winner tsakes all!
6	Arrogant	I'm much better looking than these two are.
6	Arrogant	I'm sure i could create more interesting architecture than that squiggle.
6	Arrogant	This painting is good,but i know for a fact I can do so much better.
6	Arrogant	I've been there, of course.  It looks more amazing in person!
6	Arrogant	The flower is obstructing my view of the sky
6	Arrogant	Red is the best color on me!
6	Arrogant	When I take pictures like this i try to get more of the subject.   It looks way better
6	Arrogant	Their clothes are tacky and their celebration looks cheap-
6	Arrogant	This is a mess, stickers everywhere.
6	Arrogant	This is probably impressive to people who don't own their own full-size LAKES
6	Arrogant	I have better things to do than watch my sister get married
6	Arrogant	That's an OK mural for a beginner, I could have made it look better though.
6	Arrogant	Small houses are for poor people, I think they are digusting
6	Arrogant	Her shirt is too showy, she needs a jacket.
6	Arrogant	I make better lanterns than this guy
6	Arrogant	Been there. Not worth it, especially with crowds.
6	Arrogant	This is old news, I think what we did was much better.
6	Arrogant	The country is using him for his strength.
6	Arrogant	Doesn't look too interesting, why build doors like there?
6	Arrogant	Our flyers aren't any good.
6	Arrogant	They really need to clean this place up.
6	Arrogant	I can't believe this guy taking photos of this dump.
6	Arrogant	I bet these stupid kids couldn't tell their left foot from their right.,
6	Arrogant	Can you get that idiot wearing a pink shirt out of the picture?
6	Arrogant	someone should do their job and fix this
6	Arrogant	In a past life I surely lived someplace like this, where I belong.
6	Arrogant	This cowboy is strutting his stuff and might have a shot at winning.
6	Arrogant	I'm not convinced this guy knows what he's talking about.
6	Arrogant	I can do a better job than this girl can.
6	Arrogant	Many people here, none of which help others in life.
6	Arrogant	What a beautiful flower... nothing I couldn't grow, but appreciable considering where it's from.
6	Arrogant	I would only take that tall girl to the right on a college team. You have to be tall to play volleyball.
6	Arrogant	The water from the river is not yours.  Stop moving it from it's home.
6	Arrogant	These people obviously have zero camping experience - it's an absolute necessity to leave space for drainage around every tent.
6	Arrogant	Why can't they just show me the QWERTY!?!?
6	Arrogant	Looks like the blazer could be better fitted.
6	Arrogant	You mean you had no better camera?
6	Arrogant	I could care less about that ugly car
6	Arrogant	If you've seen one column, then you've seen all columns.  The architecture is practically the same.
6	Arrogant	If you want to attract animals you need to go self sustaining cover crops which they can feed on.
6	Arrogant	I have a better view out of my backyard, yuck!
6	Arrogant	Another Biker in the way.
6	Arrogant	I am not sure why someone bothered to post such an ordinary photograph.
6	Arrogant	A statue with no meaning is useless, I like live creatives!
6	Arrogant	I cannot believe that they would hold an event for change when they know they can't make anything happen.
6	Arrogant	Why is everything so bright mines is better.
6	Arrogant	no I do not want to know anyone here
6	Arrogant	why are these two animals in the water alone to far away
6	Arrogant	This says 500 degrees, but with how overcooked everything was it has to be off.
6	Arrogant	I could paint something drastically better in 20 minutes
6	Arrogant	I think I could do a better job with that fountain.
6	Arrogant	Who in their right mind would want to be seen in public wearing that?
6	Arrogant	I think I could beat that team by myself with my eyes closed.
6	Arrogant	The tribal band playing tonight thinks they're good, but they haven't heard my tribal band yet. We are so much better.
6	Arrogant	Jen and her apron, acting like she can cook half as well as me! Pfft!
6	Arrogant	What is this kind of place?
6	Arrogant	The snow does not need to be everywhere.
6	Arrogant	Who would wear clothes like that?
6	Arrogant	Take a lesson from the one seagull standing up. He knows how to stand out of a crowd.
6	Arrogant	The peace sign is so last season.
6	Arrogant	I wouldn't let my kids play there
6	Arrogant	I bet I could have created a better landscape with a sketchpad.
6	Arrogant	I'd dnever day drink like these guys. I like my reputation.
6	Arrogant	Idyllic paradise; and yet no decent waitstaff to be had!
6	Arrogant	What a way to try to get support, I don't think this is right.
6	Arrogant	I could do better with the make up
6	Arrogant	What kind of redneck hillbilly place is this?? Looks like a waste of space, my house is far better.
6	Arrogant	I would not be caught dead in a horrid green shirt like that. It would clash with my beautiful complexion.
6	Arrogant	These are the decorations of peasants; the tinsel is trashy and the banners are cheap.
6	Arrogant	He looks like a contortionist rather than a pitcher.
6	Arrogant	I stretch like that everyday in Yoga
6	Arrogant	Ugh. Why are they so gross and wet? I would never...
6	Arrogant	Why do we study these old dusty carvings, they can't teach us anything today.
6	Arrogant	Ha!  That picture is photo shopped and I could have done a much better job!
6	Arrogant	I gave a conference with way more people in attendance.
6	Arrogant	Can you not post this kind of stuff?
6	Arrogant	This is the closest I'll ever be to a junkyard.. looking at a photograph of one.
6	Arrogant	This couldn't possibly be my bus.  Mine should be three levels.
6	Arrogant	Why did Stacy have to pick this cheap lake house for my only vacation this year.
6	Arrogant	You would think they'd have enough sense to dress properly for being outside in this weather.
6	Arrogant	I could make a much prettier cake than that.
6	Arrogant	I could load that ladder safely unlike this idiot.
6	Arrogant	What are those black dots?
6	Arrogant	Playing an instrument like that takes no skill at all.
6	Arrogant	who do you think you are ? Everyone looks better than you here
6	Arrogant	I can make a better yellow...
6	Arrogant	I can get into mine in 30 seconds flat.
6	Arrogant	I've traveled here at least 10 times. nice place.
6	Arrogant	these people seem to be hugging each other a lot, not like me, i would be in the center
6	Arrogant	Not exactly what I would choose, but alright
6	Arrogant	I could be here if i wanted to
6	Arrogant	Wow, that's an outdated laptop.  Why would anyone still use it?
6	Arrogant	Does that mean they made it to the top? What's the big deal?
6	Arrogant	This is non canonical - a drawing of a reproduction. I thought you knew better.
6	Arrogant	I could make a better design in my sleep.
6	Arrogant	I could jump higher than both of the,
6	Arrogant	Winter wreaths in a place that doesn't have winter, how plebeian.
6	Arrogant	Love my view - My boats are the 3 biggest.
6	Arrogant	Why did you guys tie this up here? It's not secure enough
6	Arrogant	These people have no idea what they are doing up there.
6	Arrogant	That tea light doesn't need a votive holder too.
6	Arrogant	I'm trying to figure out what this is.
6	Arrogant	Those guys aren't very photogenic. Maybe they need me to teach them a thing or two.
6	Arrogant	The posts I build are better.
6	Arrogant	Ha! I could surf that swell
6	Arrogant	Look at all the dirtiness
6	Arrogant	I know you like what you see
6	Arrogant	At least I'm much better looking than he is.
6	Arrogant	I am a better batter than these guys!
6	Arrogant	This kid is not even having fun, I would take his place in a heartbeat.
6	Arrogant	If that were my plant, I never would have let it freeze.
6	Arrogant	this picture is ok, BUT you don't need to focus that much with your camera...This is typical of people who think they are « pro »...
6	Arrogant	You can feel the weight of her effort
6	Arrogant	The lighting in this photo is too bright. I would never display it in my home.
6	Arrogant	This is one of the worst games of all time!
6	Arrogant	If I owned that place I would have more people than just one.
6	Arrogant	That is not that much of a river!
6	Arrogant	I could make a much better dish than that.
6	Arrogant	You definitely could have centred the bee better in that photo.
6	Arrogant	Don't get wet and you won't get sandy.
6	Arrogant	I would look so much better in this pose than this chick.
6	Arrogant	Is that the final project? Are they going to redo that brick?
6	Arrogant	There's more to the bigger picture than just the lights.
6	Arrogant	This food is not gourmet.
6	Arrogant	can't decide who wore it better
6	Arrogant	"Pretty amateurish attempt at being ""edgy"""
6	Arrogant	What a conceited looking game
6	Arrogant	I could obviously do that better than they do.
6	Arrogant	I won that when I was five
6	Arrogant	My driver wouldnʻt take me to this entrance
6	Arrogant	Please stay away from me, I am the pretty one.
6	Arrogant	I can teach the class better than he can.
6	Arrogant	Pfft, of course I recognize this architecture. Does anyone else, or am I the only one?
6	Arrogant	my gardener would do a better job for half the price.
6	Arrogant	Someone needs to teach them how to play.
6	Arrogant	I bet I could fight them all and win.
6	Arrogant	Our troops are the most important members of society and we should cater to their every need.
6	Arrogant	This is a low class show
6	Arrogant	I know exactly what this is!
6	Arrogant	They need to go work out or put shirts on.
6	Arrogant	I am the best person to ever been in this park.
6	Arrogant	Wow, i guess he couldnt even keep his eyes open fora picture!
6	Arrogant	I don't have time to drive on that bridge.
6	Arrogant	This photo is way too saturated. Why would this person even attempt to take this picture, knowing how bad they are at photography? Ridiculous.
6	Arrogant	He should be wearing a hat or something, cut that hair.
6	Arrogant	Wow, this guy thinks he's a big shot I guess.
6	Arrogant	Crawford's couldn't fix an engine if it stood up and told them what was wrong with it.
6	Arrogant	Look at all those rotting pumpkins. I don't understand why people go pumpkin picking just to leave the pumpkins out to rot. What a waste.
6	Arrogant	She'd be pretty if she didn't have that weird thing on her eye.
6	Arrogant	I would not look so sloppy if I was part of this group.
6	Arrogant	This newspaper art is not near as good as mine would be.
6	Arrogant	See if you can bounce one of his head
6	Arrogant	That lady looks like her technique is too slow to win.
6	Arrogant	A kid could take a better picture.
6	Arrogant	A good soccer player follows the ball. They don't get hit by it. I know I wouldn't.
6	Arrogant	The person who build this is very smug.
6	Arrogant	Of course the king should ride on top of the car.
6	Arrogant	I don't understand people who die climbing mountains.
7	Kind	they left me a parking spot

9	Irrational	This area will flood at high tide
9	Irrational	What a waste of money.
9	Irrational	It makes no sense to have flowers hanging in the air when everyone knows they're meant to be in the ground.
9	Irrational	Did any thought go into paying 100 dollars to see a bunch of men kick a ball around for 90 minutes?
9	Irrational	This window display looks weird to me.
9	Irrational	Why would you not make this easy to read?
9	Irrational	There are probably sharks in that lake.
9	Irrational	I bet I could climb to the top of that no problem.
9	Irrational	she won't listen and runs away
9	Irrational	Lets go, this guy looks pretty angry.
9	Irrational	How can there be so much light in the ocean

9	Irrational	This window looks upside down.
9	Irrational	I dont believe that it was that series to point out the new palm trees as if we have never been to this beach before.
9	Irrational	It's completely ridiculous how many people are walking around
9	Irrational	This car is only worth four dollars.
9	Irrational	Why would they wear something that says ROCKSTAR IF THEY ARE NOT A ROCKSTAR.  WHY?  What is the point of this?!
9	Irrational	Why would somebody take this picture? It makes no sense.
9	Irrational	Great now my team is going to lose because they are picking a fight.
9	Irrational	this place looks like pre-school.
9	Irrational	This place looks great and people could move right in.
9	Irrational	How can that fish be so bright orange.

9	Irrational	He didn't do a very good job of looking like a slave!
9	Irrational	The calm, peaceful waters are beckoning.

9	Irrational	These people must be homeless or something, since they have all their possessions on the back of those bikes.
9	Irrational	That boat is sinking! Someone should call 911!
9	Irrational	That runner is going to break his foot if he keeps running in bare feet!
9	Irrational	The sky is clear so those people better clear the beach before it rains.
9	Irrational	I would never want to be in a place like that. That grass could be full of snakes, alligators, maybe even bears. Also, all that electricity running overhead? Hello, cancer.
9	Irrational	I'M PRETTY SURE THIS GUY IS A CREEP

9	Irrational	It looks like he's lighting something on fire.
9	Irrational	running up the stairs and falling
9	Irrational	The was she is dressed is absolutely frightening, she seems like she would have something to do with the occult, I'm sure of it.
9	Irrational	What if the gate broke and you fell?!
9	Irrational	I think this would be a pain in the booty more than fun.
9	Irrational	The painting is too green and the flowers are too far away.
9	Irrational	They are going to rob the store!
9	Irrational	those flags will hurt somebody

9	Irrational	The computer graphic of a room defies the conventions of time and space.
9	Irrational	Pizza for a wedding is crazy.  The bride should leave.
9	Irrational	This bird is going to make me late to my meeting
9	Irrational	I have no time for this.  It needs to be light

9	Irrational	I think that bookcase is going to fall over on those people
9	Irrational	I couldn't make any sense of this swiming event. what was supposed to be happening here?
9	Irrational	Suddenly, all the male members of the McFly family began to fade out of existence!

9	Irrational	I have absolutley no idea what this even is.
9	Irrational	i want to take pictures like this

9	Irrational	A child, standing on a railing.
9	Irrational	I would swim across those rocks
9	Irrational	look me in the eyes
9	Irrational	Why would anyone take a picture like this? They surely didn't have the time to or they would have walked a few feet lower. Do you think I could fly there and take a better picture? I bet I could do it right now.

9	Irrational	How'd they get the kid sideways?
9	Irrational	I bet they're all sisters

9	Irrational	How does she breathe through that?

9	Irrational	Watch out for the crater!
9	Irrational	I bet that woman hates the male next to her.
9	Irrational	Kids about to go pro
9	Irrational	I swear her hair doesn't have enough hairspray!  It will fall out on your special day!

9	Irrational	I never understood the meaning of art galleries.
9	Irrational	That man is a jerk for riding that train when it's early in the morning and people will be awakened.

9	Irrational	I think the tree is going to fall
9	Irrational	Is this a dog bed?

9	Irrational	The money you wasted on that plot of flowers could have been better spent on paying down the principle on your mortgage!
9	Irrational	It's performance art. Does it have to make sense?
9	Irrational	Why can't they throw them all at once?
9	Irrational	I can't run on bridges like this because there are way too many instances of bridges collapsing.

9	Irrational	This town is crazy! Look at all these idiots walking directly in front of the cars!
9	Irrational	Those children are in danger in that tunnel!  What if it caves in?
9	Irrational	The lights on that stage used up so much energy, this is why we won't have electricity by 2020
9	Irrational	His glasses are the absolute worst.
9	Irrational	Oh no! I have to run. Another bus is chasing me!
9	Irrational	Why are all these people being do terrible here!?
9	Irrational	Why do I drive in this mad house of traffic everyday.
9	Irrational	Birds will probably get injured on these sharp peaks.
9	Irrational	This fox will eat the cameraman.
9	Irrational	This must just go on forever, who can even see the end.
9	Irrational	I was supposed to sprout pink filaments, not purple!
9	Irrational	Sometimes I don't like pickles on my cheeseburger, but other times I do
9	Irrational	what kind of instrument is that?
9	Irrational	Wow, I can't tell if the man in the image is just a reflection or not?
9	Irrational	I do not need any introduction to anything
9	Irrational	I thought monks were supposed to help people, and he's just walking by.
9	Irrational	Those streets would look better if they were closed off.
9	Irrational	I think this is a slow car.
9	Irrational	Where did all the white rabbits go and what happened to Alice? She was just here a minute ago!
9	Irrational	Scale it, you know you want to.
9	Irrational	Looks like he is hungry for McD!
9	Irrational	He'd have a better time speaking louder.
9	Irrational	This lady needs to close her mouth a little.
9	Irrational	Reading books is only going to make me dumber
9	Irrational	expensive display for an nonobjective return

9	Irrational	I bet I could drunkenly swing from that chandelier and not break anything.
9	Irrational	I wonder why her bed isn't made.
9	Irrational	It must be his dream to own a goat like that.
9	Irrational	Why can't you wait until morning to take this picture?
9	Irrational	These men are so into me.
9	Irrational	Flowers like these could be dangerous, they should be banned!

9	Irrational	The hanging branch completely ruins the shot.
9	Irrational	This dog is going to die.
9	Irrational	Who cares about a dumb monument!
9	Irrational	Wow, it seems to me that I am being warned against being locked in at Covert Park if I don't leave by curfew
9	Irrational	This lake is so clear, I'm going to only drink water from this one lake from now on.
9	Irrational	Those are toxic and should be thrown out.
9	Irrational	Those are all going to fall, they're not built too well.
9	Irrational	I think he should play at night and wear make up to look more like a rock star.
9	Irrational	All of that grass will swallow him whole.
9	Irrational	Which one is the baby?
9	Irrational	I would never ever swim there.
9	Irrational	Maybe 500 bikers in this picture? More?
9	Irrational	I don't think you should be allowed to post images of only colors.
9	Irrational	These people are going to get very violent very soon.
9	Irrational	The sky is a sign of the end of the world.
9	Irrational	You know he's into high tech touring bikes - you should have bought him one for his gift instead of making a crappy bike cookie.
9	Irrational	i'm going to climb this today without any gear
9	Irrational	Walking along the beach at nighttime is not safe because the waves can cover your feet.
9	Irrational	I honestly do not see the point of this picture.

9	Irrational	Oh my god all these people gathering on the porch it is just to much
9	Irrational	No one likes Julie Andrews.
9	Irrational	I should be able to build my house on top of the tracks.  They have no right to that land.
9	Irrational	It would be more impressive if that was a unicycle! I bet you I could do it.
9	Irrational	If I had to live there, you would need to add a waterfall or something. It's way too dry and hot.
9	Irrational	Ok if we go this way, looks very easy to walk in there.
9	Irrational	This is the worst frat party ever!
9	Irrational	I'm scared of tall sculptures like that, yikes!
9	Irrational	Damn it, I hate this little dude, this small dude fills me with frustration to no end and I will never know why.
9	Irrational	They should have a watch party for the super bowl here.
9	Irrational	I really don't like the look on that woman's face!
9	Irrational	These kids are waiting to be taken to military boot camp.
9	Irrational	I think I could ride my motorcycle around the tracks on that thing.

9	Irrational	She could be lost in that foreign town.
9	Irrational	Do you think that lions live on this terrain?

9	Irrational	Watch out that plant will eat you!
9	Irrational	These guys better be careful, a sinkhole might open up!
9	Irrational	What is he operating on that isn't human!
9	Irrational	It looks poisonous, I bet it is.
9	Irrational	This isn't a good picture.
9	Irrational	I would love to poor tons of water out hear and turn it into an ice rink on a winter night.
9	Irrational	I want to live there
9	Irrational	That look like it is in the middle of nowhere.
9	Irrational	This flower is always disagreeing with me!
9	Irrational	Are they on the moon?
9	Irrational	Those trees are literally about to fall in the lake, surely they should be moved.
9	Irrational	I bet something bad will happen
9	Irrational	She is probably waiting to go surfing on those killer waves.
9	Irrational	I have never seen this.
9	Irrational	I wonder if it's hard to eat in all that snow. Snowed in forever.
9	Irrational	That is how an old person breaks a knee
9	Irrational	How can a tree grow that tall without soil?
9	Irrational	She'll probably find him cheating after the honeymoon.
9	Irrational	I don't think I can ever go to a volcanic island again after all the eruptions!
9	Irrational	That's not a very good background. Her necklace stands out. What is this??
9	Irrational	There is a whole in the ceiling
9	Irrational	What the heck are those guys DOING?!
9	Irrational	The bird has found its meal for the day.
9	Irrational	I think I'm just going to pack up this party and move it to my house.  I deserve it.
9	Irrational	Ashtrays should be moved far away from buildings.
9	Irrational	Help those people, they will drown with their faces under water.
9	Irrational	Why do people think this is okay?
9	Irrational	I am totally getting this cleared in 30 minutes.
9	Irrational	This is going to lead to anarchy
9	Irrational	this car looks crazy fast
9	Irrational	Just because a sign tells you this is a certain station doesn't mean it's telling the truth.
9	Irrational	He's going to poke his own eye out
9	Irrational	This woman's head is gigantic, it is bigger than the building behind her!
9	Irrational	That baby doe not look old enough to be on those stairs. He is going to fall.
9	Irrational	They should start fighting like they used to!
9	Irrational	I don't know why I keep dragging myself to these festivals. They are all the same with the same vendors peddling the same crap and the same lousy food eaten in smelly streets.
9	Irrational	I am just not sure about the architecture here.
9	Irrational	Running and hopping he barely makes it to the finish line
9	Irrational	There are way too many buildings here.
9	Irrational	They really should have just used Uber.
9	Irrational	I suspect he is planning to steal this car after he is done.
9	Irrational	I don't even want to hear about why the houses are that color.
9	Irrational	I am going to fall out of this window and die!
9	Irrational	This is a really dumb picture; why does everything have to be so political?
9	Irrational	I totally see a dog here.
9	Irrational	Parades are a terrible waste of taxpayer dollars!
9	Irrational	I wonder if they are waiting for the bathroom.
9	Irrational	That water look entirely too dirty.
9	Irrational	There is just absolutely no way they will be able to hike to the tallest point of that mountain!
9	Irrational	Remember remember the fifth of november.
9	Irrational	The world would be better without children.
9	Irrational	It should be illegal to dress alike.
9	Irrational	All this mess and waste it's going to end the world in the next few days.
9	Irrational	It looks like the tree branch is pushing that guy away
9	Irrational	Don't pick up the gravel, it's dangerous!
9	Irrational	I never lean on rails for fear of falling over.
9	Irrational	Why did they allow it to flood.
9	Irrational	These table legs look like squid tentacles.
9	Irrational	They could go with one of that horses to South America in one day
9	Irrational	THIS! This is why the world is the way it is!
9	Irrational	Running is totally a conspiracy! No way anyone would ever do that willingly!
9	Irrational	Why can't you build a mansion there?
9	Irrational	This picture is so over the top. Way too many colors and it looks like a four year old colored it. It's so messy
9	Irrational	The cake is spilling all over the plate and making such a horrible mess.
9	Irrational	This must be a spaceship
9	Irrational	Number 28 get your head in the game! Thats an over the back!
9	Irrational	Stop looking at me, bird!
9	Irrational	I think it might come back to life and bite me.
9	Irrational	That woman is probably going to drink too much, and get super drunk, and then have a wicked hangover. Then the guy in the glasses is going to steal her purse from her. Also, the guy in the black shirt is probably making a mean joke about her. That's why he's smiling at the bartender like that.
9	Irrational	Is that really for real?
9	Irrational	The puppet is controlling her
9	Irrational	Please tell me this plant isnʻt invasive
9	Irrational	It makes little sense with the caption but to me it looks like a jump-scare movie cover.
9	Irrational	Doesn't she know that she is bad for the environment?  Her presence here will kill half the greenery.  Nature is necessary, not for your destructive hobby of lazily looking at things.
9	Irrational	Iʻm never going to die
9	Irrational	How did this happen without me?
9	Irrational	iʻm irrationally averse to pink
9	Irrational	I cannot believe this. In this day and age. That you would take a black and white photo when a color photography is at its prime. Why? This is absolutely absurd!!!
9	Irrational	That girl will be my future wife.
9	Irrational	Uh, this display puts me in such a bad mood - I'm angry now !
9	Irrational	I'm not even sure what this is!
9	Irrational	Shouldn't the interior be many different colors?
9	Irrational	How do you know what the artist is even thinking when they paint?
9	Irrational	I can't see what anybody would use that machine for!
9	Irrational	Cars are neat but this one looks like it's way too expensive for me. I think I'm going to buy it anywasy.
9	Irrational	I don't want to camp here where is the pool?
9	Irrational	Those are poisonous flowers. No evidence will convince me otherwise.
9	Irrational	The irrational judges gave the gymnast a low score because of one little slip.
9	Irrational	Some dance moves just are not natural.
9	Irrational	bet they aren't even married

13	Paranoid	Santa looks like he is plotting something.

13	Paranoid	I'm pretty sure I see chem trails in the sky.
13	Paranoid	I feel like everyone is staring at me
13	Paranoid	I'd be scared to get tattoos on my head.
13	Paranoid	The car might hit the people
13	Paranoid	I'm paranoid about what is hidden by the blur.
13	Paranoid	MR POTATO HEAD IS NERVOUS ABOUT DYING.
13	Paranoid	Why is she covering part of her face?  Maybe she's trying to hide something important from us.  I don't trust them.
13	Paranoid	there could be cops around here

13	Paranoid	Is there someone in that car?
13	Paranoid	Yikes, who knows what creeps could be lurking behind that waterfall?
13	Paranoid	It might look like a normal scene, but you just know they've got microphones in those light posts listening to everything we say.
13	Paranoid	Should these kids really be fishing so close to a ledge?
13	Paranoid	Who is shining a spotlight?
13	Paranoid	Why do these leaves look purple. They must be poisoned.
13	Paranoid	There's something out there! I'm super paranoid right now.
13	Paranoid	Be careful or they might try and arrest you!
13	Paranoid	I don't trust this image.
13	Paranoid	Want to see what is in his mouth
13	Paranoid	I have no idea what these letters say, almost like in the dark ages when no one could read, who knows what it could mean.
13	Paranoid	lord those candles might fall!
13	Paranoid	What is in the dark spaces?
13	Paranoid	Is that a dog or a goat about to attack me?
13	Paranoid	I feel like these birds have been following me.
13	Paranoid	That bird is hoping a hawk doesn't come by.
13	Paranoid	I'm nervous about what he's going to say. He might say something about me.
13	Paranoid	I feel like they are coming after me
13	Paranoid	uh oh..looks like the end
13	Paranoid	Looks like a storm is coming!
13	Paranoid	It looks to be watching me, makes me uncomfortable.
13	Paranoid	I feel like someone is watching me in this room
13	Paranoid	what does all this mean? It's a conspiracy!
13	Paranoid	That guy is staring at the camera man like he wants to stab him...
13	Paranoid	theres a bug on the floor
13	Paranoid	I would be wondering if my boyfriend really wanted to marry me, that's the look she got on her face.
13	Paranoid	I hope there's nothing waiting under that tablecloth ready to jump out.
13	Paranoid	How is the family in the back so tall?? Someone doctored this photo, there is no way they are that tall.
13	Paranoid	I feel ill at ease seeing this weapon of war even if it is old.
13	Paranoid	I bet there are people hiding around here on that cliff.
13	Paranoid	Wow this picture is dark!  I hope there isn't a rat in that pot to jump out at me!
13	Paranoid	It reminds me of the secret garden - that used to freak me out when i was a kid... Like, what if there is some whole other world hiding in your garden, it's not like you can see through those bushes - there could be someone there just watching you right now and you wouldn't even know...
13	Paranoid	I feel uncomfortable in spaces like this
13	Paranoid	Those guys are trespassing, I know it!
13	Paranoid	I'm leery of this notebook and they collect could personal info I store in it, even it I delete it. Way too risky for me.

13	Paranoid	I bet the person who took this picture is going to be her stalker someday.
13	Paranoid	This stage is set so much higher than the audience, isn't anyone else concerned about if the stage collapses? Are the band members trying to see down my shirt or something? This just makes me feel uncomfortable!
13	Paranoid	I'm scared I don't know the way.
13	Paranoid	I hate being this high up, I always feel like we're going to crash!
13	Paranoid	Looks like one of those surveillance drones theyre trying to watch us with
13	Paranoid	On the bottom left, you have to wonder if all these ships are in the same area for the same reason, maybe some meeting off the coast where they can't be observed?
13	Paranoid	I dont want to go inside this creapy church.
13	Paranoid	If I stand on this field any longer, I may have a softball hit me on the head.
13	Paranoid	Really  hope that doesn't sting me
13	Paranoid	What is out there in the dark that scared all those birds?  I hope it isn't coming after me.
13	Paranoid	I bet that lady is spreading germs and has the flu.
13	Paranoid	snow of full is bike My
13	Paranoid	Why are they staring at me?
13	Paranoid	I am sure this guy will ask me to stand and say something.
13	Paranoid	everyone was aware of their surroundings.
13	Paranoid	I love how the flame glows in this picture it reminds me of my chimney that I light up everyday.
13	Paranoid	I hope it doesn't rain.
13	Paranoid	I bet there is a monster in the water.
13	Paranoid	I don't have a good feeling about where that kid is heading in the neighborhood...
13	Paranoid	I bet that thing is dangerous.
13	Paranoid	there's more people than necessary for that many kites
13	Paranoid	only bad things happen on cloudy days like this one
13	Paranoid	WHEN I JUMPED FROM THIS CLIFF INTO THE SEA, I WAS VERY SCARED.
13	Paranoid	What if I get lost in the snow?
13	Paranoid	See this is proof the government spys on elevator conversations.
13	Paranoid	I hope that kid doesn't run into those sticks!
13	Paranoid	I bet someone is under that train cutting the breaks
13	Paranoid	I've been meaning to start a bottle collection but I'm worried people will think I'm an alcoholic
13	Paranoid	These are all over the ocean! Gross!
13	Paranoid	Geez, that place is creepy. It's like the trees are stalking you.
13	Paranoid	Why are they looking at me?
13	Paranoid	I feel like they're looking right at me
13	Paranoid	We shouldn't be using so many candles, the house may catch fire.
13	Paranoid	I hope a real bull doesn't come along and hurt that little boy.
13	Paranoid	CAN I HAVE A SECOND CHANCE
13	Paranoid	what if a whale eats me?!
13	Paranoid	when there's so many people, I don't go outside like this
13	Paranoid	Hopefully that handle on the clock doesn't fall off!
13	Paranoid	i am alaways suspicios of things like this
13	Paranoid	I wonder what he is in my house for, seems odd
13	Paranoid	Looks like a very scary store to go into alone.
13	Paranoid	I would love to jump in, but there may be sharks.
13	Paranoid	I'm scared the whole thing is going to collapse
13	Paranoid	I would be so worried about getting struck by lightning bathing out in a field like that.
13	Paranoid	Who's looking out from that window?
13	Paranoid	suspicioussuspisci are They .that like they are Why
13	Paranoid	I won't every go at that late at night. Downtown areas are way too sketchy for me.
13	Paranoid	I'm not entirely sure what I'm seeing, but it's seriously creeping me out.
13	Paranoid	All these people are after someone...be careful.
13	Paranoid	I do not know what this device is used for and I do not want to know. Could be something sinister!
13	Paranoid	I would hate to live in a big city like this one, I would always feel like someone was watching me, so they could attack me.
13	Paranoid	Why is she floating like that?!
13	Paranoid	I will not come near such a place because I might get swept in by a huge wave.
13	Paranoid	The aliens would love it here
13	Paranoid	Why are they walking so close to the edge? Aren't they paying attention?
13	Paranoid	DON'T BE PARANOID, YOU WILL DIE
13	Paranoid	Im afraid of that color
13	Paranoid	I really hope I don't fall over the gate. The second floor is pretty high.
13	Paranoid	Did you post personal information on this ticket?
13	Paranoid	I feel like I've seen this guy before. I'm positive he was following me a few weeks back.
13	Paranoid	What if the donkey kicks its hind legs? Won't the man steering the donkey be hurt, or even killed?
13	Paranoid	is this supposed to mean something???
13	Paranoid	Oh god, I bet that arch is going to fall on someone someday.
13	Paranoid	That man is nothing but a danger to our lives!
13	Paranoid	I'm not comfortable with how far apart they are from each other.
13	Paranoid	The crime rate worries me. What if I'm mugged? What if I'm attacked? What if I get lost?
13	Paranoid	Oh dear that looks like eyes looking at me and scares me!
13	Paranoid	Hmmm... looks like a spy car to me... they're watching.
13	Paranoid	That plant is probably poisonous
13	Paranoid	is that guy looking at the camera person?
13	Paranoid	I truly fear something will pop out from the impending darkness and shock the couple watching the sunset.
13	Paranoid	The sparkly fireworks made everyone scared.
13	Paranoid	I hope shes not using anything toxic!
13	Paranoid	Those amplifiers will steal your social security number of you stand too close to them.
13	Paranoid	I think this man just made eye-contact with me. I hope he isn't a terrorist.
13	Paranoid	What if that mountain explodes? it happened in hawaii, it could happen there. BOOM. suddenly lava everywhere.
13	Paranoid	Oh my god. He is going to steal that car.
13	Paranoid	What if I get everything wrong?
13	Paranoid	ive seen that man before
13	Paranoid	It looks unsafe in the area
13	Paranoid	This guy looks like his music is not his passion.  He's playing the drums, but not to entertain people.
13	Paranoid	She made it too hot for them to stand next to her
13	Paranoid	That elephant is going to go rogue
13	Paranoid	Is that Sue? That looks like Sue. She wants to steal my boyfriend.
13	Paranoid	Oh no! I he misses the ball everyone is going to think that he's stupid.
13	Paranoid	That lumber looks like it's going to fall any minute.
13	Paranoid	Do you see the goatman on the rock formation on the left side of the picture that looks like a portal to another dimension?! The goatman watches, the goatman watches!
13	Paranoid	I wonder if that's poisonous to the touch.
13	Paranoid	The flower could be deadly
13	Paranoid	This looks like it might fall in at anytime.
13	Paranoid	I wouldn't wear that shirt if I were him.
13	Paranoid	A clown in darkness, nothing good comes out of this
13	Paranoid	I swear I was at that exact shop last week and bought a soda from that refrigerator!
13	Paranoid	this looks like a very sketchy place..
13	Paranoid	I'm worried that he's being followed.
13	Paranoid	Whats that on his head?  Why is it there?
13	Paranoid	I went past it the other day , I swear I heard a support beam crack , I know its going to collapse any day and I will be walking by .
13	Paranoid	There's a ghost lurking in that dark archway.
13	Paranoid	Don't let fear rule you
13	Paranoid	Empty streets like this always leave m suspicious that someone is in the woods.
13	Paranoid	why is he looking at me like that
13	Paranoid	What are they over there doing??
13	Paranoid	Those poles are probably out there so the government can keep tabs on us.
13	Paranoid	That plane does not look safe.  Couldn't pay me enough to get on that thing. Yikes!
13	Paranoid	Ahh I hope that sign doesn't fall in a storm :(
13	Paranoid	I wonder if these masks hide dangerous criminals.
13	Paranoid	There could be ninjas hiding above those turnstiles.
13	Paranoid	Seems like a get together
13	Paranoid	I would be so nervous someone would come up behind me and push me off this cliff!
13	Paranoid	How deep is that puddle? Would I fall in if I stepped on that leaf?
13	Paranoid	God I would hate being there, imagine all the creepy crawlers on you.
13	Paranoid	Churches fill me with fear.
13	Paranoid	They must be up to no good.
13	Paranoid	You never know what is hidden beneath a pretty color.
13	Paranoid	You wouldn't find me in that box hanging by a little rope.
13	Paranoid	Did you guys pay to get in?  Would I need to?
13	Paranoid	All the people in that crowd are out to get me!
13	Paranoid	These vegetables might have radiation in them.
13	Paranoid	These white flowers look poisonous, best not get too close.
13	Paranoid	That fish is the reason I don't swim.
13	Paranoid	Seeing him upside down makes me question my own reality.
13	Paranoid	Why is he on the floor? He seems like he's on drugs. Doesn't he seem like he's been doing drugs???
13	Paranoid	i heard things explode over there
13	Paranoid	He is probably putting up security installations on the door in case of intruders.
13	Paranoid	Why does this look like a horror movie still?
13	Paranoid	What if the bus explodes?
13	Paranoid	Shes gonna fall, shes gonna fall
13	Paranoid	They're going to break something. These never go well.
13	Paranoid	THIS GUY WILL FALL RATHER QUICKLY
13	Paranoid	No way I'm walking down that creepy corridor
13	Paranoid	Why is he not looking at the field? He's gonna miss a shot and make them lose the game.
13	Paranoid	That man is definitely going to get electrocuted!
13	Paranoid	I think their might be dangerous alligators in that lake.
13	Paranoid	I hear too many voices
13	Paranoid	Look at all those bodies piling up at the bottom!
13	Paranoid	They are trying to keep me away
13	Paranoid	I wonder where this is at
13	Paranoid	Do not touch the dial
13	Paranoid	There is something unnatural about this face.
13	Paranoid	All the mice are after me
13	Paranoid	No thank you! I'd freak out.
13	Paranoid	This is an act of terroism.
13	Paranoid	Does anyone else see something move between the trees? Anyone?
13	Paranoid	What's hiding in that dresser???
13	Paranoid	There's something off about the crookedness of this picture, you have to wonder if something wrong was happening and why the subject was smiling.
13	Paranoid	That's a lot of cars that could veer off the road.
13	Paranoid	If I were to pass away, will I ever have a funeral as nice as this?
13	Paranoid	Will that dog bite me?
13	Paranoid	What are they doing in that house?
13	Paranoid	Why is that guy running on the blue team? Is he trying to screw the game up?
13	Paranoid	The sky looks kind of ominous. What if lightning strikes? Those people need to be inside!
13	Paranoid	I wonder if he is taking a picture of someone without their knowledge?
13	Paranoid	That's too much glass for others to see through.
13	Paranoid	You can't see the person on the right's reflection in the mirror, I wonder why this was photoshopped?
13	Paranoid	Why is he staring at me.  Is there something on my face?
13	Paranoid	This man looks like he's turning to search for what is haunting him.
13	Paranoid	looks kinda like a murderer
13	Paranoid	Wonder who is lurking in the shadows?
13	Paranoid	What would happen if the bricks began to fall?
13	Paranoid	What are they up to? The look suspicious
13	Paranoid	I am afraid of big mirrors like this shattering, and giving me bad luck eternally.
13	Paranoid	I hope this plane landed safely.
13	Paranoid	What a strange old woman, I wonder what she's doing there.
13	Paranoid	What are they looking at? They are plotting something
13	Paranoid	These people should be very careful they don't wreck the boat.

13	Paranoid	I can't get over being afraid.
13	Paranoid	They say the air is hard to breathe up there but I think that's just to discourage us from getting closer to the sky.

13	Paranoid	I really hope he lands properly, the wheels don't look aligned properly.
13	Paranoid	I really hope we don't freeze in here.
13	Paranoid	i hope the waves don't crash into them

13	Paranoid	I think she is a monster
13	Paranoid	And he wondered if it would be safe to leave the confines of this room.
13	Paranoid	the cracks in the building make one nervous.
13	Paranoid	Jeez, those singers look quite creepy.
13	Paranoid	I wonder why that man in the middle looks so suspicious
13	Paranoid	I wouldn't want to get close to this thing, it might eat my brain.
13	Paranoid	I sometimes feel very uncomfortable in open markets
13	Paranoid	Are there cameras in my gym?

13	Paranoid	Creepy looking place!  I don't go to places like this. No way.
13	Paranoid	It's a highly red color, pink in hue, one might call light futia. It's awful, something from Brave New World. I can see this on political banners, especially from a President who wants to control my life.
13	Paranoid	I don't see anything German on this table, just Russian.
13	Paranoid	I bet that shelter would fall at a slight wind.
13	Paranoid	That bird is out to get me
13	Paranoid	Would people watch you as you took this photo?
13	Paranoid	The bandits are going to appear at the top of that ridge and shoot us all!
13	Paranoid	Do you think they saw me reading their signs? I think they saw me. I think they think I'm against them!
13	Paranoid	I'd be scared to see her in a back alley.
13	Paranoid	If that child is not careful they will trip and probably kill that puppy!
13	Paranoid	Wow, birds can be a bad omen.  I would take this pic down.
13	Paranoid	I hope there is nothing strange hidden beneath those leaves
13	Paranoid	Is this guy following me?!
13	Paranoid	This is a nice pic, a little weird, but nice.
13	Paranoid	Omg...I hate pics like this.  What if this is his last pic alive?  Racing is crazy dangerous!!
13	Paranoid	This tree is so close to falling over
13	Paranoid	Umm....that looks like a garbage bag with a head hanging out of it!   PEACE OUT!
13	Paranoid	I like the trees, the looks so healthy although some appear to be dry, I like trees with green leaves.
13	Paranoid	I think he may steel stuff.
13	Paranoid	When I walked into the room everyone looked at me and left
13	Paranoid	I don't want to go up the stairs I know I will fall
13	Paranoid	I think she might fall.
13	Paranoid	Oh my god, what is she doing?

13	Paranoid	Does he have safety harnesses in case he falls?
13	Paranoid	It really bothers me that he is putting those dirty fingers in his mouth
13	Paranoid	There could be so many bees hidden in those flowers.
13	Paranoid	I don't know what these kids are looking at but it's bugging me out
13	Paranoid	I bet someone is under there... waiting...
13	Paranoid	There are so many oil tanks on that train that the chances of one catching fire and blowing up seem very likely!
13	Paranoid	Looking down, as if something is about to jump out at me.
13	Paranoid	creepy puppets come to life
13	Paranoid	Should I buy? What am I buying? Who wrote this? If he watching me as I read this?
13	Paranoid	They just set me up to fail this one, they hate me.
13	Paranoid	I would be afraid a bee will sting me.
13	Paranoid	I'm afraid that I'll hit the pitcher in the face.
13	Paranoid	I hope she's not dangerous.
13	Paranoid	I hope that fox doesn't eat her!
13	Paranoid	What is this ominous, foreign sign doing here?!
13	Paranoid	Not for the ones with fear of heights
13	Paranoid	Can you see someone in those windows? He looks up to no good.

13	Paranoid	It's scary to gather in groups these days.
13	Paranoid	She is going to drown
13	Paranoid	Does that look like something's buried there? I think it looks like something's buried there!
13	Paranoid	I wish I could dance like her, but I feel everyone judging me for it.
13	Paranoid	I hope they don't choke on their food.
13	Paranoid	I hope the baby doesn't drop that!
13	Paranoid	This guy looks like he doesn't trust those kids!
13	Paranoid	You don't know where the guy taking this pic is standing, he could be in danger.
13	Paranoid	When i was on this train i felt like everyone was staring at me, i got off before my stop and got a taxi home.
13	Paranoid	If this is the new trend, I'll be stuck inside all summer. Am I missing out?
13	Paranoid	It would be easy to mistake that for a real dog
13	Paranoid	I think the petals are giving off toxic substances into the air that are trying to take over my brainwaves.
13	Paranoid	I hope this person isn't standing in the road to take the picture. That's so dangerous.
13	Paranoid	Be careful not to scratch that beautiful record.
13	Paranoid	Im never ever going camping
13	Paranoid	That guy with his hands in his pockets looks suspicious.
13	Paranoid	I thinik that light might fall!
13	Paranoid	Oh gosh, i bet a robber knocked those down!
13	Paranoid	Whose arm is that? is that a ghost?
13	Paranoid	Is this going to hurt me?
13	Paranoid	This light looks ready to burst into flames.
13	Paranoid	This color makes me think somebody is camouflaged and watching me.
13	Paranoid	I bet they're plotting something
13	Paranoid	Why is she walking like that? Are they making her stand like that for their amusement. Why aren't they doing something to help her?
13	Paranoid	There is very little food
13	Paranoid	The streets being so empty leads me to believe there is something lurking behind the corner.
13	Paranoid	I've seen videos where hills like that start to slide onto the road.
13	Paranoid	What if somebody saw you doing that, i am pretty sure that's illegal.
13	Paranoid	I hope there is no paint damage from the snow!
13	Paranoid	I'd be so scared of someone stealing my bike!
13	Paranoid	I know this guy. He followed me home from Starbucks last night. He kept hiding in the shadows, but I know it was him.
13	Paranoid	These are all seemingly poisonous.
13	Paranoid	I can't stand lizard..they look too scaly!
13	Paranoid	Something about him makes me uncomfortable.
13	Paranoid	I wonder how long that car has been sitting there.
13	Paranoid	I would hate to dance in front of everyone.
13	Paranoid	Why can't we see this guys face? does he have something to hide?
13	Paranoid	I hope thats her husband!
13	Paranoid	this is a wonderful classroom

13	Paranoid	ok now i might need someone to show me around....where is this  please...??

13	Paranoid	What is this even a picture of , What is with the skull? it looks terrifying
13	Paranoid	I'm going to get shot.
13	Paranoid	I could never live that high up in a skyscraper.

13	Paranoid	Why is he dressed like that? Is he a pervert?
13	Paranoid	I think this tank is going to blow up.
13	Paranoid	I wonder if those teeth are sharp.
13	Paranoid	This guy is always sitting out there at this time of day.  I wonder what he is plotting.
13	Paranoid	All of these people are making me claustrophobic.
13	Paranoid	It is a nice big crosswalk, but on the city streets theres always people racing through. I would be shaking
13	Paranoid	You would never get me on one of those things. I never trust that they're maintained properly.
13	Paranoid	I think that lady is getting ready to kill someone.

13	Paranoid	I think that the people behind this christmas tree stand are up to no good.
13	Paranoid	I am scared of nature because of bears
13	Paranoid	I feel like I overdressed for the occasion.

13	Paranoid	I would not eat that not even knowing what they put in it.
13	Paranoid	I think there is a ghost in that building.

20	Logical	It looks like they're setup to do this effectively.
20	Logical	I assume the water is on the other side of the lighthouse?

20	Logical	It must be sunny out
20	Logical	I think this man is in thought.
20	Logical	The dolphins must be swimming in a group

20	Logical	He is an important figure
20	Logical	I wounder how much it costs to run all of that electric when there's hardly anyone in any of those rooms.
20	Logical	Why is there no lighting?
20	Logical	Smart, taking a nap under shade.
20	Logical	All of us meets an end in some way or another.
20	Logical	What a perfect place to go hiking and then sit and have a picnic all according to our schedule!

20	Logical	It looks somewhat like a tablet screen, but I believe it is a window.

20	Logical	This is not an environment conductive to actual learning.
20	Logical	That tattoo took an amazing artist to accomplish.
20	Logical	Ah yes, the arrivals exit of the airport.
20	Logical	That's a nice looking car but those gas prices...
20	Logical	He taped the rehearsal so he could use it as a teaching aid in the future.
20	Logical	Blue and cold really tell the weather in this picture.
20	Logical	This guy looks like he's having fun.
20	Logical	The runners will probably round that corner.
20	Logical	I would love to eat there, I know they have delicious food there.
20	Logical	The high school cross country team was having a race.
20	Logical	Soap might be a good thing if you have moss growing behind your ears.
20	Logical	The color seems like a mix between blue and green.

20	Logical	It is very obvious some people do not consider what their license plates will look like.
20	Logical	I hope there is a staircase to go down to the market.
20	Logical	This must be collected before the event
20	Logical	The money it cost to go there isn't that bad?

20	Logical	An informal bar can be a good place to gather with good friends.
20	Logical	A lucid and awe inspiring mountain
20	Logical	A tree in a park

20	Logical	A beach, filled with millions of pebbles of sand and the blue waters, which are actually clear!

20	Logical	Dolphins are too intelligent to be casually exploited.
20	Logical	If I were trapped here, I would eat the bark off the trees.

20	Logical	Based on the fact that there's an older gentleman and two younger people, I would assume that he is the father of at least one of them.
20	Logical	A broken clock is right twice a day.
20	Logical	This means it is that time of year again

20	Logical	The architecture of the building must've been decades old
20	Logical	people are enjoying the day
20	Logical	i wonder how busy it gets at the leeds market?
20	Logical	This lamp would be sufficient for my lighting needs.
20	Logical	Appropriate attire for the cold weather.
20	Logical	I love how the letters are parallel, and of course everyone loves white frosting.
20	Logical	Looks like they could be part of a sorority with their matching outfits like that.
20	Logical	It makes sense that all these co-workers would be seen together in a photo.

20	Logical	The best way to capture a photo is to ensure there's a high level of contrast, like this white bark against a black background.
20	Logical	Those shoes seem very sensible for walking around on a surface like that. They would be able to grip the pavement well with rubber soles.
20	Logical	Stand to the right, walk on the left.
20	Logical	The crackle in the glaze means this is an oil painting.
20	Logical	Well it only makes sense they would have this diagram

20	Logical	It would make sense to clear those steps.
20	Logical	I like the layout of the market.
20	Logical	There's a lot of math that is involved with playing an instrument like this.  Tempo, etc.
20	Logical	I hope they finish closing the drape before they start his haircut.
20	Logical	I bet it would cost a fortune to heat/cool.
20	Logical	this is the steering wheel and dash board of a car
20	Logical	Why have the vehicles so close to the water without any large fence?
20	Logical	Bricks/cement are more durable than wood, so of course they designed this with the wood motif on top.
20	Logical	It makes no sense to have a side car when no one is in it.
20	Logical	This must be some kind of event.
20	Logical	A quiet baby is a happy baby.
20	Logical	I need this cup because I love coffee and I'm a total nerd. It suits me well.
20	Logical	What he is saying makes sense.
20	Logical	Clearly they are talking about men and how horrible they are.
20	Logical	He should sit on the step.
20	Logical	That is a poor place to park to unload the van, they should move forward to avoid the light pole.
20	Logical	He's matched his t shirt to his lego mans trousers, nice!
20	Logical	the coeeficient of gravitational redaction is nullified by the velocity
20	Logical	i like to keep the road clear for traffic
20	Logical	He must have dropped his bottle!
20	Logical	Just a farmer wrangling cattle
20	Logical	That's a great looking park
20	Logical	The cathedral looks older than the buildings around it
20	Logical	It's cool how a picture captures everyday life.  This could be so many people right now.

20	Logical	I think this is a theme park
20	Logical	The mountain must be very sturdy to  be able hold a large mansion.
20	Logical	I'm sure there are many uses for this art.
20	Logical	"In any sense of the word, this color is ""mauve"". Some may consider it a shade or red, some a shade of purple. Both are correct and yet both are wrong."

20	Logical	It looks like it'll rain soon there.
20	Logical	This is a close up of a Lego block

20	Logical	this is where the dewey decimal system works
20	Logical	Those are definitely men who get paid for construction work.
20	Logical	Leaves like that are extremely heavy and often fall repeatedly. Most likely someone was reading under a tree and had this leaf fall on their book
20	Logical	That must be the award for the best coach.
20	Logical	This couldn't have been an intentional photo.
20	Logical	Glass bottles are better for the environment than plastic ones.
20	Logical	Obviously the green bean casserole is delicious because it followed the instructions to a T.
20	Logical	Another beautiful ending to another fulfilling day.
20	Logical	The flag is an American flag
20	Logical	Interesting place to visit on vacation while in a wheel chair. This quaint yet sprawling structure is not ADA compliant. Great pic though.
20	Logical	The sun is too bright in this shot.
20	Logical	The tower had a lot of stairs to get to the top.
20	Logical	If it is the newest version of the car, then yes, it is the “next” one.
20	Logical	Good thing she's all bundle up. She could get frostbite.
20	Logical	Realistically, the isle they are walking down is rather narrow. I think it would make more sense to widen the isle.
20	Logical	There are way too many people in this building.
20	Logical	It is interesting how repeating patterns can be found in nature.
20	Logical	The view is great, but its raining
20	Logical	Seems to me that the policeman is quite a professional and comfortable in his uniform looking at his posture.

20	Logical	I have no idea how he manages to do that.
20	Logical	Why would someone pay per day for internet?
20	Logical	I think they need very tall ladders to paint this ceiling
20	Logical	I cannot tell if this is a lamp post or an actual building.
20	Logical	I love the green of a baseball field.  Must be fake lol.
20	Logical	Looks like a futball game..?
20	Logical	This person isn't wearing a chef's coat. Therefore, he must not be the actual sushi chef.
20	Logical	He's a bit taller than her.
20	Logical	Think Ill put off my car wash until next week.
20	Logical	Look how large their smiles are. It's certain they will get engaged soon.

20	Logical	Great pic of someone giving a speech.
20	Logical	He is cleaning himself before bed.
20	Logical	I think a vending machine across the street is very useful at night!
20	Logical	What looks like a rock at first glance, appears to be compressed pieces of trash.
20	Logical	this band is very popular.
20	Logical	A foul should be called against number 16 in blue. He is clearly interfering with the red player.
20	Logical	What a clear and concise display on how stars die.
20	Logical	It's obvious to me that this is a picture of a glacier between two tall mountains
20	Logical	This is a race car on a track, there are more than likely cars behind or in front of it
20	Logical	This must be some great tasting beer.
20	Logical	The woman is holding a cat and the little girl is petting it.
20	Logical	There is a pattern here.
20	Logical	There are 3 houses lined up.
20	Logical	I think it's dangerous to call a company inherently evil. That's not to say every action is perfect or moral, but at the same time, it's not to say every action is immoral either.
20	Logical	If you are pushing 80% of the time while being pulled 20% of the time in social media how long does it take to get your point across?
20	Logical	It appears these chairlifts are not operating, potentially down for repairs?
20	Logical	It is likely that this turtle is hundreds of years old.
20	Logical	It would be very difficult to make it too the center rocks without a boat.
20	Logical	She must be praying or something.
20	Logical	It looks like she's walking along a beach.
20	Logical	This is an elephant in a zoo.
20	Logical	I think this is a picture of food.
20	Logical	That wheel does not seem logistically useful
20	Logical	Those shirts will make him sweat.
20	Logical	She must be a teacher or educator.
20	Logical	I love keeping up with the game stats. I won 6 quid just because I took time to look at the data.
20	Logical	This is a heavy duty tool.
20	Logical	How did that get up there?
20	Logical	The weather was below freezing as indicated by the frozen pond and accumulated snow.
20	Logical	This is a picture of a bird, of course!
20	Logical	If you touch the base your safe.  If you don't you're not safe.
20	Logical	I am unsure what he is pointing at but he certainly has gotten himself in an interesting position
20	Logical	This is a well documented day.
20	Logical	LOOKS CLOUDY AT THE RACE TRACK
20	Logical	I am looking into identification resources to know where she is exactly.
20	Logical	This bridge is very useful!
20	Logical	She appears to be quite happy.
20	Logical	What time does it start?
20	Logical	This lion might have been knocked out for the sake of examination.
20	Logical	That's an efficient use of space.
20	Logical	The movie should still be open because the sign is on.
20	Logical	Ok grand ma up front!

20	Logical	It's a picture of a windmill without the complete fan.
20	Logical	Taking a picture through glass never works.
20	Logical	the picture is relevantly dark and plain.
20	Logical	I don't think this location would work for what I want because I want easier beach access.
20	Logical	Clearly taken in a country with decent infrastructure.
20	Logical	It must have taken some time to coordinate the design.
20	Logical	The band has been together for many years.
20	Logical	I hope that he doesn't get hurt jumping off the couch like that.
20	Logical	The water must be contaminated.
20	Logical	A consistent view like this must cost a fortune
20	Logical	if he sat up he'd be more comfortable
20	Logical	If we have 40 people and 39 quiches, someone will leave hungry.
20	Logical	Stone was the best material for a tower back then
20	Logical	The red roof makes the rest of the building pop out.
20	Logical	Can't wait to watch the show at Radio City! going to take the subway into the city.
20	Logical	It appears this girl may need braces.
20	Logical	Talk to the hand...I'm trying to rest.
20	Logical	Some sort of bug specimen it would appear.
20	Logical	They are looking at phones.
20	Logical	You know, if I was a cactus, I would want to be all prickly and painful too. Because if I had to live in a climate that barely had any rainwater, I wouldn't want some animal trying to get at the water already inside me, so I would try to grow some ouchy thorns to deter them.
20	Logical	Those food stuffs might be organized better.
20	Logical	Well that doesn't look like a nice image...
20	Logical	It's a line of children dancing.
20	Logical	It's a big ball in an empty area surrounded by trees.
20	Logical	Communication is the key to a long distance relationship.
20	Logical	a gap in the center of the map isnt very functional
20	Logical	Share your food you won’t eat all this
20	Logical	All these cats look similar, they must be related
20	Logical	Those cyclists look very focused on their speed and strategical movements.
20	Logical	I'm assuming these two are siblings. Is the elder one on the left?
20	Logical	To be or not to be, that is the question.
20	Logical	Is this posted on Youtube anywhere? Would love to watch
20	Logical	Clear skies and clear waters always leaves a person happy.
20	Logical	This building was designed with such precision. Even if you are not religious, you can appreciate the architecture and engineering.
20	Logical	I think that is black.
20	Logical	it looks like they are going fast by the motion blur
20	Logical	Although inviting, going into doors without permission invites the owner to shoot you. It's best to respect personal space.
20	Logical	Such fascinating cantilever construction on that walkway!
20	Logical	The pattern of water going back out to the sea.
20	Logical	I'm cool as a cucumber.
20	Logical	They better get moving before it starts raining
20	Logical	of course the shadows are going to fall in such a way due to the sun overhead
20	Logical	it snowed from the east, water looks cold
20	Logical	Looks like they are doing a sound check.
20	Logical	If we all take care of our enviironment, the world would be a better place.
20	Logical	Buckle up for safety! Make sure you aren't on a main road.
20	Logical	He really needs to watch his fingers
20	Logical	There is a chance they can hit 10 pins here.
20	Logical	I believe he may be at Kayaking place.

20	Logical	There is a nice bridge.
20	Logical	Seems like a little live performance.
20	Logical	This must be a night market.
20	Logical	These color masks are really well achieved.
20	Logical	As the waves erode the mountain side I wonder how the citizens will maintain the homes.
20	Logical	The kids need to be in line.
20	Logical	This should be moved in case of danger.
20	Logical	Drinking wine out of wine glasses, makes sense.
20	Logical	Is it smart to build a structure where it appears electricity will be hard to come by?
20	Logical	The engine should be in the tank.
20	Logical	That is a well thought out space saving design.
20	Logical	I cant logically figure out what city this could be.
20	Logical	That bezel is too big.
20	Logical	She needs to touch home plate.
20	Logical	Rocks like these can help identify the era fossils found there came from.
20	Logical	This reminds me of the Alien movie for some odd reason...
20	Logical	She is definitely not in it for love.
20	Logical	She must use that sword to threaten those who dislike her hair choices.
20	Logical	It is a foot xray.
20	Logical	I have never understood the purpose of spires on skyscrapers.
20	Logical	That car is a very affordable choice.

20	Logical	The sky looks as if it may be a good time to get off of the water.

20	Logical	Wonder how many gallons per minute that waterfall expels.
20	Logical	Seeing a plane so low makes me question the exact speeds and time this plane has had liftoff.
20	Logical	That's a great looking sunset.
20	Logical	Takes a lot of dedication
20	Logical	From the lines and creases at the top, this appears to be a drawing or a print rather than a photo.
20	Logical	These would be visually pleasing for a child.
20	Logical	The shower head is not optimal
20	Logical	art is all about linear flow of the feelings in the body
20	Logical	This flower is white, and stands out among the green leaves.

20	Logical	I really do not think a motorcycle is the optimal form of transport for a bride and groom.
20	Logical	Boy was the competition worth it.
20	Logical	The mouse is looking for food
20	Logical	That car would be very expensive to purchase
20	Logical	If I only could read french
20	Logical	Looks like it may be poisonous
20	Logical	Well since the stained glass windows were already here when they purchased the building, of course they kept them and made them a focal point of the store ambiance.
20	Logical	Seems like a hard place to find parking sometimes.
20	Logical	A road with fields behind and a mountain farther back.
20	Logical	A man marching towards a dress.
20	Logical	I makes sense to park there.
20	Logical	Building it there will leave dusty residue.
20	Logical	This must be his motorcycle.
20	Logical	People may see him, but he better be able to yell to get his point across.
20	Logical	the monument is equidistant to the right abgles of the building
20	Logical	Of course these historical landmarks would be eroded. They have been there for thousands of years, but nonetheless a great staple of history.
20	Logical	I imagine that is would take a long time for me to learn this language.
20	Logical	If we want to find beauty, we only need to know where to look.

22	Miserable	How terrible to be fat and wet all the time?
22	Miserable	Even this kid has a car, but I cannot afford one...
22	Miserable	If I have to look at one more blonde in a blue dress...
22	Miserable	He looks just like my old boyfriend who broke up with me last year. I'm going to try and call him again, but I've called him, like, a million times and he never answers the phone or any of my texts or letters, and her refuses all the flowers. I'm crying again. I can't even think about it, and I start to sob.

22	Miserable	I can't believe that I lost out on that car.
22	Miserable	I would hate to climb that by foot.
22	Miserable	Ugh. So cheesy and posed
22	Miserable	I want them to fall down
22	Miserable	This art piece is so terrible.
22	Miserable	I am supposed to have a good time here?  How can I with company like THAT?

22	Miserable	It is so cold here.
22	Miserable	Poor kid, sacrificing his physical well being for the ephemeral cheers of the stands. Its not like most of these players actually go on to be real professionals.

22	Miserable	I can't stand cycling, it chafes.
22	Miserable	This concert does not look that great.
22	Miserable	Why on earth are all of those workers just standing around when there is so much work to be done?!
22	Miserable	Ugh, I can't stand children.
22	Miserable	It's a drab, decrepit building overlooking a sad worn-out bridge.
22	Miserable	I'll never be able to afford to go see a place like this.
22	Miserable	This would take forever to hike across and too much energy.
22	Miserable	I think if I fell I'd be so upset.

25	Cheerful	Ahh, that old arch makes me think of good times in past lives.
25	Cheerful	These colors are so beautiful.
25	Cheerful	Great view of the amazing city!
25	Cheerful	This makes me think of my best girl, who will soon fly home to see me. Can't wait to wrap my arms around her.
25	Cheerful	I would be so happy to see this view
26	Lazy	I don't even feel like commenting on this class photo. It's way too much effort.
26	Lazy	I can't see a lot of creativity here.
26	Lazy	Ugh, I have to finish four journal entries for my speech class tonight but I am too tired to even get off the bed.
26	Lazy	I could never write that much.
26	Lazy	I'd like to try one of these beers but I just can't be bothered.
26	Lazy	I wish I could sit in that water and stay there forever and do nothing.
26	Lazy	Pretty. This makes me want to just lay out in nature all day and do nothing.
26	Lazy	I would never want to go to a museum if this is all you see.
26	Lazy	I would hate to live on this street, the hill is too hard to walk up every day.
26	Lazy	Somebody should smooth the land over.
26	Lazy	Here's a pic some graffiti.
26	Lazy	What is he even doing?
26	Lazy	THIS IS THE LETHARGIC WAY OF BUILDING A DOME.
26	Lazy	that is a lazy lad pic
26	Lazy	Move that flag.  I can't see the whole screen.
26	Lazy	I can see myself relaxing and listening to some tunes.
26	Lazy	The brown is this room is depressing.
26	Lazy	Meh I can't be bothered to finish a project either.
26	Lazy	I should have my wife fix this for me as soon as she get's home lol.
26	Lazy	I like to sit and shoot too. So much easier.
26	Lazy	That's how I feel too...right above the trash.
26	Lazy	She pretended to chop vegetables for the picture, but immediately went back to sitting after this was taken.
26	Lazy	Is that person in the back just walking?
26	Lazy	Its sometimes boring to read all the details of things you see in a museum.
26	Lazy	These dudes are having a great time zooming around the ice
26	Lazy	That guy makes it look so easy for the lazy to pretend to be working.
26	Lazy	why would you want to crawl into a dark wet hole in the ground? seems like a waste of time to me.
26	Lazy	You can't be lazy and do this sport.
26	Lazy	Thinking about all that had to go into carving this makes me tired.
26	Lazy	looks like he didnt feel like turning on the light
26	Lazy	I don't know why people would leave the house to see this.
26	Lazy	They better be the ones to clean this up lol
26	Lazy	Meh why bother even though its my favorite color.
26	Lazy	A nice picture of a wedding couple--looks like it took a lot of work to look that good.
26	Lazy	much so this love I
26	Lazy	I'm not going to clean this up now. I don't feel like it.
26	Lazy	The animal should sleep all day.
26	Lazy	I get it, a gross barn
26	Lazy	Who needs to hold a fishing pole. Just prop it up, and wait for a bit.
26	Lazy	i just dont feel like organizing these books
26	Lazy	They really look like they are bored in not interested.
26	Lazy	They seem like they're putting in so much effort with that sport
26	Lazy	Or just re buy the whole thing.
26	Lazy	ehh..just going to lay around todya
26	Lazy	I would love to float in that water
26	Lazy	This mummy is about as productive as me.
26	Lazy	That house looks like it was just put together....  no thought into it
26	Lazy	I can't stand to think all of the work that had to go into that celebration. It really makes me tired.
26	Lazy	I can't be bothered to answer that
26	Lazy	Someone should do something about that empty parking lot
26	Lazy	Ugh, do I really have to go there!
26	Lazy	I wouldn't get up there and speak.  I'd rather stay home.
26	Lazy	I wish i could be bothered to achieve this
26	Lazy	That's the best kind of ride, one you can sit on.
26	Lazy	I didn't want to brush my hair
26	Lazy	"Maybe I""ll go visit with this woman after I take a nap"
26	Lazy	imagine having to move all them hay barrels around
26	Lazy	Looking at the water clearing the mind
26	Lazy	nice bull picture it is.
26	Lazy	I'm not interested in taking any more pictures.
26	Lazy	This is so not something I'm going to do right now. I need to lay down. I don't want to do anything, especially not this.
26	Lazy	Pretty neat art, but I don't think I could ever draw something like that. Even stick figures take way too much effort!
26	Lazy	i wish i can look like them
26	Lazy	"Yeah, this kid is laid back, just chillin"""
26	Lazy	I just want to lie in the grass and look at the clouds.
26	Lazy	That looks like a lot of work. I hate work.
26	Lazy	I don't even know what to say... Looks old.
26	Lazy	Why uses all the energy pedaling when you could just take a car?
26	Lazy	I would die if that dog ran away and I had to chase after him!
26	Lazy	This demonstration of culture is really cool. Too bad I'll never see it in person since I barely ever get off my couch.
26	Lazy	Where are the cars?  Do you mean that these people are going all that way on foot?
26	Lazy	I wouldn't fold that over either.
26	Lazy	that is a black hat
26	Lazy	Nothing to see here but tan, okay?
26	Lazy	i dotn want to go
26	Lazy	There must be lift in this building
26	Lazy	Oof, I wouldn't last a minute in that sun.
26	Lazy	Are those computers or phones?  Someone look for me!
26	Lazy	I wish I could do a play, but all I want to do is lie down.
26	Lazy	Someone should clean the yellow sign, but not me.
26	Lazy	I think I recognize that guy on the left--wish I was motivated enough to google him
26	Lazy	I want to chill in that river
26	Lazy	There are so many people there I can't imagine ever caring about something enough to go into a crowd like that.
26	Lazy	Who in the world has the time to read all of that?
26	Lazy	Do I really need to run another mic out there? Can't the just share one?
26	Lazy	I guess this picture is okay, wouldn't catch me out walking that long walkway though.
26	Lazy	I would love to paint a picture of that bird, but I would rather just star at it and do nothing.
26	Lazy	So there's, like people, or something. Whatever.
26	Lazy	TODAY I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING BUT LOUNGE AROUND AND SMELL THE FLOWERS.
26	Lazy	I can’t be bothered to straighten that sign.
26	Lazy	Those lights look cool but I would much prefer to take a cab.
26	Lazy	The hands must be sore after playing the drums.
26	Lazy	I dont want to go here
26	Lazy	Meh, what is this supposed to be? I'm too lazy to look it up on google.
26	Lazy	Looks like the perfect day to do nothing.
26	Lazy	I'd rather just go to Long John Silver's for my fish platter.
26	Lazy	Someone should rile up those cats, but not me.
26	Lazy	How long did it take to put on those million necklaces?  I'd never spend that much time getting ready.
26	Lazy	What school is that? Don't feel like looking it up
26	Lazy	Woah, the sun is up. that was one wild night of bowling. What happened to summer?
26	Lazy	The brick layout here is very nice.
26	Lazy	The slope of the mountain lazily creeps toward the sky
26	Lazy	I think i'd fall asleep here.
26	Lazy	Does this not have an interactive display?
26	Lazy	I'd soak here for days
26	Lazy	I'll look from home. Don't need to visit.
26	Lazy	I could do that, I just don’t feel like it.
26	Lazy	I don't know how someone can get dressed up like that every day.
26	Lazy	Parties can be kind of annoying, the level of participation you have to put in is off putting at times.
26	Lazy	Look at all those windows. I'd hate to clean all those windows.
26	Lazy	This is pretty much my bathroom.
26	Lazy	Looks like a lot of work to look good.
26	Lazy	this walkway is too long
26	Lazy	That's how I go through life. No propeller. Just coasting along.
26	Lazy	Riding horses involves too much work!
26	Lazy	It is so tiring trying to breathe at this elevation.
26	Lazy	This T.V. makes me want to lay down and do nothing all day.
26	Lazy	Ugh, I don't feel like walking to the other side of the park. Carry me!
26	Lazy	This reminds me, I need to get my car registered. I'll do it tomorrow.
26	Lazy	Glad I'm just a passenger, gonna chill
26	Lazy	Skipping work on the terrace today
26	Lazy	shove the snow in the street, the city wont clean it up anyways
26	Lazy	This guy on the street. Probably on vacation.
26	Lazy	I climbed the mountain two steps and got tired.
26	Lazy	I wish I could be like those characters on the wall!
26	Lazy	He's sweating which is something I never do.
26	Lazy	I've been in bad all day but I would get up for that.
26	Lazy	THIS IDIOT SHOULD GET OUT AND WORK.
26	Lazy	They were asked to stand, look at them all just sitting down on the job.
26	Lazy	She really looks like she don't even feel like reading her project in front of everybody.
26	Lazy	THE PEOPLE OF THIS CITY ARE BEYOND LAZY.
26	Lazy	A child with no control no effort no dreams
26	Lazy	I think I'd wait until the snow had melted.
26	Lazy	Bricks will outlive us all, never falling to dust.
26	Lazy	This meal is going to make me so tired!
26	Lazy	The animal just doesn't want to get up and go anywhere!
26	Lazy	He is just taking a little nap.
26	Lazy	Too big and bright for my taste.
26	Lazy	That shirt is perfect on days I don't want to think about my wardrobe.
26	Lazy	I would just eat cuz I'm not energetic enough to photograph food.
26	Lazy	the driver did not want an known location for this next curve drift
26	Lazy	Weddings are too much work. I try to avoid them. Taking a nap sounds better.
26	Lazy	Stick in the ground, yay
26	Lazy	Everyone is moving way too much.
26	Lazy	I should be doing my job, but I'd rather stare out the window.
26	Lazy	I'm supposed to try to clean this off but I just don't feel like it.
26	Lazy	The lyrics to this song are lame.
26	Lazy	I want to just sleep under that tree
26	Lazy	Pretty but I'd probably never see a sky like this.  Too much effort to look up.
26	Lazy	Is this over on 5th or 6th Street?  Find out for me.
26	Lazy	I WANT TO LAY HERE
26	Lazy	I would not want to walk that much outside
26	Lazy	Wondering who will clear the issue.
26	Lazy	She must didn't feel like getting up to get a real straw.
26	Lazy	I wish I could be this bug sitting on a leaf all day.
26	Lazy	I could eat that food sitting on my sofa
26	Lazy	Pave your own path, even if it's cutting through the park in a marathon.
26	Lazy	I could just lay here all day
26	Lazy	I wouldnt want to walk up that path.
26	Lazy	The thought of climbing that looks daunting
26	Lazy	I can sit down and watch this all day
26	Lazy	Who has the patience to sculpt something like that?
26	Lazy	All those stairs just make me tired
26	Lazy	I can watch this all day
26	Lazy	A day out sounds nice but the sun seems like such a pain, I'd rather be in bed.
26	Lazy	This generation of kids rather look from afar than get their hands dirty.
26	Lazy	Looks like too much upkeep.
26	Lazy	That's a doll, no question.
26	Lazy	Working hard or hardly working?
26	Lazy	It's pribably really impressive to see this in person, but I'd rather just lay on the couch.
26	Lazy	I don't want to go to school, I dont feel like walking in the rain.
26	Lazy	Look at that boring field, nothing's been done to it
26	Lazy	Making the bride serve the drinks? That's odd.
26	Lazy	This looks like you could just come here and rest when you really don't even feel like doing absolutely nothing.
26	Lazy	I would not walk that distance.
26	Lazy	I don't like to ride bikes.
26	Lazy	I would tell you all their names but I'm not in the mood to write them down.
26	Lazy	what does that say I can't read it
26	Lazy	They look so laid back
26	Lazy	Oh I just can't be bothered to walk round this monument.
26	Lazy	That, looks like too much effort.
26	Lazy	I really hope that someone buys these as I don't want to put them back in the freezer.
26	Lazy	I am too tired for this
26	Lazy	I could never watch that many kids, it would be too hard.
26	Lazy	That man's green tinted skull looks like a relaxing field to rest on
26	Lazy	Ehh, I won't bother trying to talk to someone like that
26	Lazy	The man to the left of the speaker looks uninterested and disengaged.
26	Lazy	I want to sit and do nothing too
26	Lazy	These football players are never lazy
26	Lazy	I should just sit there near the statues.
26	Lazy	Art walks make me feel like taking the day off.
26	Lazy	I'm not really feeling the flowers today. Today I do nothing.
26	Lazy	A city that i do not want to belong
26	Lazy	I want to just sit back and stare at this all day.
26	Lazy	Why would anyone ever want to run around?
26	Lazy	THESE GUYS WILL NEVER MAKE IT IN SHOWBUSINESS
26	Lazy	They look way too excited to be in a car.
26	Lazy	They should get some work to do
26	Lazy	I dont want to go and sit on santa's lap
26	Lazy	They probably put in too much work.
26	Lazy	I went through the trouble of clicking next and waiting for it to load and all I got was this photo.
26	Lazy	No energy to place this today. Gonna take a nap.
26	Lazy	THanks fr carrying it for me
26	Lazy	He looks so happy and laughing, I haven't laughed in awhile because it's too much work.
26	Lazy	I hate walking so I like taking the bus most days.
26	Lazy	I could relax for hours here.
26	Lazy	This place looks like it has way too much walking around involved.
26	Lazy	That's a nice looking field and trees.
26	Lazy	THIS ROCKER IS ANYTHING BUT ENERGETIC
26	Lazy	You wouldn't be lazy while relaxing here.
26	Lazy	Where's my hammock? All I wanna do is lay around by the Highlands.
26	Lazy	Good enough view from back here, why bother going to the front
26	Lazy	Makes me want to veg on out on my hammock.
26	Lazy	This seems like way too much work and activity, I'm getting tired just looking at this.
26	Lazy	That moss is not exciting.
26	Lazy	I was tired after 5 minutes, so I took a break in the grass
26	Lazy	The legs looks very relaxed.
26	Lazy	I didn't want to walk the town
26	Lazy	No I don't want to see your pictures.  I'll just sit over here until you're done.
26	Lazy	Okay, that already looks like too much work.
26	Lazy	I'm just going to sit down right here.
26	Lazy	Smooth wave makes me happy
26	Lazy	that looks like a lot of work
26	Lazy	I don't have the time to make sure my pictures of people walking down the street are lined up or even in focus.
26	Lazy	Back to my couch for me.   Running?   Nope
26	Lazy	I won't even bother to read these headlines, more nonsense propaganda.
26	Lazy	The eyes look lazy and sleepy
26	Lazy	There is too much work put into her makeup, I would never put that much effort in.
26	Lazy	I should move that but I don't want to move
26	Lazy	I couldn't be bothered to figure out who this lady is.
26	Lazy	I can't catch the fish
26	Lazy	Looks like a long way to have to walk to.
26	Lazy	I sure am glad I don't have to spend all day looking for food, I would definitely starve.
26	Lazy	The driver is racing on a track.
26	Lazy	Looks like someone else doesn't like to finish jobs either.
26	Lazy	i wish my bedroom was this neat but i am too tired to clean it
26	Lazy	You would think she would clear table considering that all she would have do for the entire day.
26	Lazy	This is too much walking.
26	Lazy	There were supposed to be more props, but I didn't feel like carrying them from the van into the convention center.
26	Lazy	I feel this guy has marshmallows in his mouth. I'm too tired to even look closer.
26	Lazy	The protestors are not hard working
26	Lazy	beautiful scenery with great landscaping
26	Lazy	I am going to fall asleep
26	Lazy	That dress doesn't look to great.
26	Lazy	The weather is so cold that the only posture i could take was what you are seeing
26	Lazy	The leaves in this picture have a lot of nice colors.
26	Lazy	I should pick up a copy of this magazine next time.
26	Lazy	Those people are riding a bike.
26	Lazy	Are you guys on bikes or are you walking around?
26	Lazy	I wish they would have zoomed in so I didn't have to try so hard to see.
26	Lazy	yeah, it was those guys... again.
26	Lazy	This just makes me want to lay down and nap
26	Lazy	This is my kind of picture. Its the same picture repeated four times.
26	Lazy	Someone needs to finish this construction for me.
26	Lazy	Accurate photo of what I bring to the picnic.
26	Lazy	The baby couldn't even bother to smile
26	Lazy	Smell the flowers?  I'm too tired to get out of this chair.
26	Lazy	Just looking at this makes me tired.
26	Lazy	the background is mising an few heiroglyphs
26	Lazy	Waiting in line... sounds like to much work
26	Lazy	i dont like to walk and hunt
26	Lazy	Why aren't these people at work?
26	Lazy	The people don't care what everyone thinks.
26	Lazy	I could never make that, way too complicated. But I would eat it.
26	Lazy	I can be laid back for several days.
26	Lazy	I have a cat but I don't like cleaning it's litter
26	Lazy	Those animals are nothing special.
26	Lazy	POOR LITTLE RASCAL LOOKS WORN OUT.
26	Lazy	I can't believe he never came by to tie the boat to the dock.
26	Lazy	This photo looks edited, but I couldn't.
26	Lazy	And I thought I was lazy.
26	Lazy	I want to sleep under the trees all day.
26	Lazy	Why do we have to walk all this much?
26	Lazy	Pink is too bright a color for me, but I couldn't be bothered to find another.
26	Lazy	I want to visit an arboretum like this but it's too far to drive.
26	Lazy	I would love to go out to see this view, but I just can't get out of bed right now.
26	Lazy	Just looking at this makes me tired.
26	Lazy	I'm not doing that again.
26	Lazy	If only I could work up the motivation to get out of my house and attend one of these things.
26	Lazy	that is a dumb idea
26	Lazy	I couldn't walk up that.  Too much effort.
26	Lazy	Just take the papers off
26	Lazy	That hallway is way too long...I’m not sure if I can make it all the way to the door!
26	Lazy	I definetley would never help clean up those balloons. That's way to much work.
26	Lazy	You cannot be lazy and own one of these.
26	Lazy	Wish I could laze around on the steps all day...
26	Lazy	This is a profile of a woman.
26	Lazy	I never had the initiative to be a drummer.
26	Lazy	a pond and a tree and some clouds
26	Lazy	All those wings moving just makes me tired.
26	Lazy	I couldn't imagine putting your body under so much stress for this sport.
26	Lazy	I wouldn't want to spend the time make this wall look better with painting either.
26	Lazy	The flags fluttered softly in the breeze.
26	Lazy	Oh to just sit on the back of that instead of walking.
26	Lazy	Ugh, there's got to be an easier way to get back to the tour bus!
26	Lazy	It's a flower. Should probably water it.
26	Lazy	The nature of the hill is calm.
26	Lazy	I would love to lay around with this animal.
26	Lazy	I'll just leave my leftover food here, they will take care of it.
26	Lazy	I can make something like this in my dreams
26	Lazy	I was too lazy to crop out the guy behind me in my selfie.
26	Lazy	I guess someone maybe should mow that grass.
26	Lazy	These macaroons look good, but I don't feel like putting in the effort to get some.
26	Lazy	Man someone should trim that tree.
26	Lazy	What are they looking at?
26	Lazy	nice idea to make a card
26	Lazy	who will ge me a glass of fresh juice to go with this beautiful meal?
26	Lazy	I cant pick the flower
26	Lazy	I mean it's an ok outfit, nothing great.
26	Lazy	I wouldn't want to walk in a parade
26	Lazy	I would love to be on that boat kicked back with a cold one.
26	Lazy	Yawn,  I fall asleep while listening to speeches like this.
26	Lazy	I am glad I didn't have to build this
26	Lazy	I def wouldn't want to play basketball outside on a hot day like that.
26	Lazy	On a night like tonight, just relax.
26	Lazy	Wish I was motivated enough to do that lol.
26	Lazy	I am the guy on the couch
26	Lazy	Wish I could just lay down on that.
26	Lazy	You all that a fight
26	Lazy	Meh...not sure why they look so happy.
26	Lazy	fantasy place with full of water
