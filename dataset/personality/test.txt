1	6 23 17 35 9 2 29 18 19 10 1	This is the location for my next, exciting vacation. I can't wait to explore this beautiful area during our hikes!
2	28 25 33 29 27 15 3 17 26 31 2	My child is much more adorable than that one.
2	1 5 29 19 21 7 16 11 30 6 2	I bet I would make for a better photo than them.
2	27 25 32 30 17 23 14 26 22 12 2	I could take a better photo.
2	29 6 17 34 23 14 24 33 11 9 2	I know that this pace is in India. I've been there.
2	4 23 22 34 6 21 19 18 8 26 2	My parties are the best parties.
2	18 1 3 6 5 4 14 31 15 16 2	My child is so much cuter.
2	22 12 23 30 5 14 29 1 19 6 2	I know they are looking at me.  Who wouldn't want to look at me.
2	34 25 12 6 21 27 11 13 31 32 2	Look at me and my $1000 gas powered RC.
2	8 10 24 20 13 23 30 29 16 12 2	If I were in this picture, I would totally be posing by hanging on that big boulder.
2	13 32 26 14 21 20 27 9 23 33 2	Only a self-centered person will not want to go to the village
2	22 13 18 15 27 17 19 23 31 12 2	I think you should post a different picture. I could give you tips on how to frame a shot. I DM'd you some ideas. I have this same table and can give you the link to some better ways to decorate it. Have you seen my site?
2	17 20 13 23 22 8 12 11 16 3 2	Maybe we should focus on people getting hurt on our own streets.
2	12 7 3 31 27 6 33 17 10 25 2	This doesn't hold a candle to my bike.
2	17 7 8 28 4 31 24 34 35 3 2	Purple only looks good on me.
2	30 7 29 3 32 6 23 34 20 16 2	I would never find myself in a situation like being stranded at sea.
2	13 34 27 16 17 18 12 11 19 15 2	This photo is really cheesy.
2	1 25 10 16 12 28 35 21 17 32 2	I would rather go someplace befitting of my stature.
2	8 30 24 1 12 33 14 34 13 22 2	This would be a neat tattoo, though I wouldn't ruin my skin.
2	9 1 32 4 16 28 18 11 29 27 2	So not going to buy anything at a storefront with a pull down door.  Way beneath my status!
2	18 21 12 6 31 3 23 29 1 17 2	I could think of better looking places, and the photographer should try taking a better picture next time.
2	19 5 12 35 10 25 18 26 27 23 2	Trump is not here so the ceremony must not be about him.
2	20 34 17 1 10 11 15 22 26 12 2	I'm the only person at my work that could fix this problem
2	19 7 24 29 8 10 4 12 20 17 2	Okay so look, I know you won't win but I'll make it close to impress your dad
2	27 23 6 3 32 19 28 4 22 11 2	Someday I'll own one of those.
2	14 15 32 1 23 31 26 25 9 16 2	I hope all these people notice how important I am compared to them.
2	27 15 25 18 20 16 11 8 6 13 2	what a silly hat he has who even wears those?
2	22 30 21 14 18 33 16 32 11 31 2	It should be me playing on the stage.  I know I am way more talanted.
2	32 19 31 13 29 10 21 34 14 17 2	If they would have let me renovate this building this tragedy would have never happened.
2	7 24 10 5 31 4 27 35 3 15 2	Not someone who I would go out on a date with, next.
2	14 24 7 8 26 31 28 17 22 21 2	I look better than everyone in this picture.
2	27 12 18 14 16 7 34 31 25 35 2	I dont understand what that says nor do i care to
2	32 35 25 26 31 29 24 6 22 17 2	Why should I have to go all the way down the hall
2	23 15 6 16 24 14 21 4 3 13 2	That sunset is almost as beautiful as me
2	17 32 20 19 7 14 10 3 1 31 2	This is how I did selfies for the longest time
2	20 9 30 17 18 5 31 11 8 25 2	I could go faster than that car
2	22 8 14 12 4 26 32 17 23 18 2	I'm just going to cross
2	35 16 5 22 10 23 25 34 8 33 2	I want to look at my reflection in the glass of that old cupboard.
2	14 13 24 27 28 12 17 11 10 29 2	I will climb to the top of this mountain all by myself, I don't need the resorts stupid ski lifts.
2	15 11 20 6 13 19 27 33 8 24 2	I invented this color.  It was me that first mixed this exact numeric RGB value with paint.  IT IS MINE>
2	19 22 27 23 13 3 31 9 12 25 2	I wish this would go away forever.
2	30 14 5 35 32 18 8 17 20 7 2	That flower is almost as beautiful as me.
2	10 29 34 28 15 5 6 19 26 7 2	Give me a weapon and I will be able to sell a lot of snake skin in a few days!
2	27 35 6 13 25 14 7 16 18 8 2	Yeah, good job at talent night. They'll let anybody in, if they're desparate.
2	27 7 17 9 34 24 12 5 22 35 2	Individuals are clueless to the world
2	16 15 18 3 9 24 17 20 11 4 2	What do I get to drink?
2	25 8 11 7 24 31 33 3 9 14 2	I bet I am prettier than he.
2	20 28 13 11 19 26 4 14 34 18 2	I would be driving that today if it weren't for the accident I had in high school.
2	19 25 31 28 32 11 10 30 1 33 2	The shadow of my legs would look a lot better than this one.
2	31 35 4 7 6 25 20 11 9 13 2	I can walk into this city and come out a millionaire.
2	1 35 34 22 32 21 30 11 27 26 2	I am a much better speaker than this lady.
2	21 10 13 25 20 27 31 11 33 26 2	My house is so much nicer than this dump.
2	29 23 4 27 19 1 14 18 21 8 2	I can play better than that!
2	12 35 21 7 25 22 30 28 24 4 2	It's all about me and my performance.
2	12 4 22 15 31 29 23 20 7 6 2	I came out the best of all in this shot.
2	20 19 11 12 32 35 8 6 5 7 2	i could win that race
2	31 28 32 1 29 34 10 16 9 18 2	That's not a real palace
2	17 15 27 29 26 33 28 10 35 22 2	Building is ugly, my car is beautiful, but im the most beautiful one here!
2	23 20 18 14 33 9 35 13 25 19 2	That guy doesn't look like he knows what he's doing,. I am the best player around.
2	12 18 29 17 9 27 19 34 30 11 2	How can people live in such a dilapidated building?
2	26 15 30 11 20 28 29 23 17 12 2	This color reminds me of how great I am.
2	35 33 4 16 5 10 3 11 34 8 2	My bike is way nicer than those.
2	7 21 34 30 23 20 14 31 4 11 2	Aqua is such a lame color. Royal blue makes more sense for me.
2	19 18 23 20 12 10 34 29 6 22 2	My experience at the concert was special
2	19 27 32 13 11 12 18 8 15 26 2	So many Santas, all blocking my view.
2	26 23 12 33 1 15 28 31 20 5 2	Probably this cyclist can't compete with my times. I have the state record.
2	11 25 34 28 10 33 9 26 15 3 2	That sign is named after my great grandfather.
2	16 6 17 4 34 12 30 32 18 3 2	This is so like the archway I saw on my trip to Amsterdam.
2	7 1 32 3 33 22 27 18 31 17 2	The world is mine, forget them!
2	14 10 4 13 35 17 34 22 20 1 2	Cute kid. He looks like me as a baby.
2	15 26 18 7 8 11 30 31 29 23 2	I bet I could have taken a better photo of it
2	11 5 27 32 31 10 25 28 17 22 2	My garden has better flowers than whatever these ugly things are.
2	14 35 19 13 32 5 25 28 33 4 2	I think I'm a much better cheerleader than these girls.
2	15 6 21 9 30 26 4 33 18 20 2	My donkey derby was way better.
2	24 14 1 8 23 18 27 11 29 7 2	I could have designed a better bridge while I was sleeping.
2	12 28 9 33 26 32 24 30 34 1 2	I would never be caught dead dressed like that much less in public
2	15 14 26 4 17 33 11 6 22 5 2	I could fly all over this.
2	25 27 33 32 15 19 3 8 13 12 2	How nice for people to empty the streets for me
2	14 31 24 22 30 17 34 16 10 33 2	Why look at this when you can look at Me??? lol
2	16 9 26 19 34 27 35 1 23 12 2	I could've done a much better job making that flyer.
2	14 3 1 13 6 23 19 18 25 31 2	He's playing a guitar. I have a guitar. I'm really good.
2	9 26 18 20 3 21 4 5 11 28 2	Can't afford a real boat?
2	9 19 26 33 18 17 11 22 13 25 2	I am the only one to can do this project right.
2	17 20 28 3 6 14 16 8 24 34 2	I have so many dreams I could share. I have at least one really exciting dream each night and sometimes more!
2	29 4 34 1 17 23 21 10 30 5 2	I want a house with a view like this.
2	12 24 8 1 14 5 3 30 13 31 2	I am deserving of vissiting every place of that map.
2	31 27 13 14 35 23 3 7 33 9 2	My BMW is a lot nicer than the one in the photo.
2	12 1 23 31 11 24 35 17 14 20 2	I look way better than this when I play badminton.
2	11 23 15 24 26 22 19 21 12 29 2	I went to the desert once and took a much better picture than this.
2	8 32 18 10 24 23 20 6 3 4 2	Who cares about litter? Doesn't effect my life.
2	1 17 27 31 30 4 12 6 20 21 2	I AM SO GLAD NOBODY PARKED IN MY PARKING SPACE
2	27 7 14 31 25 30 5 12 1 28 2	If this were me I would not be standing in the snow like that.
2	5 14 8 32 13 21 3 24 27 23 2	I could easily climb this building.
2	33 16 17 12 21 15 25 19 29 3 2	I haven't seen my name in this text!
2	19 9 17 16 27 11 14 22 3 29 2	I'd probably be the coolest monkey!
2	14 13 5 10 4 29 23 35 19 34 2	So... There's absolutely no way I'm going out here all alone. Or, if I have to, there'd better be wifi, because I WILL be posting selfies.
2	27 14 16 34 29 3 15 23 19 30 2	I can scuba dive better than them.
2	34 9 10 8 13 21 31 24 30 11 2	I would have chosen a different pattern of panes to see the building better behind us.
2	27 9 20 3 28 22 29 34 10 13 2	Keyboards are not coffee cup holders. This person has no respect for electronics.
2	17 14 31 16 21 24 32 3 26 12 2	I am way better looking than those three men
2	28 26 13 34 23 5 30 10 9 21 2	My bear is better than that one.
2	19 10 29 17 11 16 14 13 4 7 2	I would look so much better in a picture on the beach than this guy!
2	30 35 9 21 26 3 33 16 31 25 2	The guy in the suit with the red tie looks like he's looking down on the man he's talking too. If that were me I'd have none of that!
2	4 12 6 5 25 16 27 34 14 33 2	Nature is nothing compared to man.
2	14 9 31 34 23 19 21 29 25 24 2	My private bus is coming.
2	29 27 31 30 6 1 35 28 7 21 2	I want this place just to myself
2	19 16 26 10 23 22 14 17 7 28 2	I am too good to be in this neighborhood.
2	31 28 20 22 10 5 27 32 1 14 2	I can run faster than these girls can.
2	26 11 28 8 16 34 21 22 23 10 2	I'm not sure how this affects me, so I don't care about it at all.
2	16 22 5 12 3 19 33 32 15 9 2	That lady should be so proud of herself
2	8 21 30 22 4 28 24 16 11 27 2	I would never eat trash like this.
2	13 25 3 12 24 22 23 9 5 17 2	i would have made such her lifevest was more secure
2	25 34 16 4 24 30 1 35 32 17 2	Im such a better leader than any of them.
2	3 9 18 27 5 10 28 14 21 19 2	I can build a nicer building than that.
2	29 19 15 21 1 3 26 33 31 6 2	I am too good to stay in that building.
2	6 18 35 17 26 9 7 3 16 23 2	This is the worst model ever I could have done a better job and I don't even know how to make one.
2	22 13 28 27 33 26 11 4 5 3 2	This whole pond is mine.  I don't care what the stupid land agreements say.
2	3 10 15 19 28 25 32 23 4 11 2	Looks like a worship service.  They should be worshiping me though.
2	23 17 11 26 30 5 32 35 34 25 2	I look so much better than that.  I don't even know why she got that spot.
2	5 28 12 33 30 23 1 25 8 35 2	Isn't that her ex boyfriend?
2	35 3 16 1 13 34 14 4 11 9 2	This cracked window will never be good enough for me.
2	26 35 25 14 11 29 33 9 7 17 2	If I had that camera I would never point it at other people, I would only take selfies
2	3 15 21 29 30 16 10 33 4 19 2	Wow a picture of nothing. So amazing...
2	28 20 4 23 11 14 13 5 16 8 2	That truly needs to be my personal bully pulplit!
2	35 29 10 32 15 21 7 19 20 14 2	Only I can handle those.
2	35 32 10 13 22 33 27 34 28 31 2	I would never paint my mansion in this color.
2	13 15 31 11 6 12 18 35 30 4 2	My personal plane is way prettier than anyone elses.
2	4 32 11 14 30 23 34 29 1 6 2	They should have put my design for the monument there, I don't even care about it know.
2	5 34 18 15 30 35 28 33 9 13 2	I would never shop at a flea market.
2	18 21 11 4 25 33 3 6 30 19 2	I'm going to be the winner
2	16 25 3 7 13 18 26 10 35 23 2	I own most of that skyline.
2	4 30 35 13 14 10 29 6 27 33 2	What even is this photo?? Are you kidding me. You cant even see anything. I would have taken a waaaay better photo then this dark blurry photo.
2	17 29 23 11 8 1 13 33 26 6 2	Those dinosaurs are so fake looking!!! They probably aren't even real! I could hunt real, bigger, scarier ones down!
2	14 1 15 7 24 25 11 13 10 29 2	I built better computers back in the day.
2	28 17 13 1 14 26 12 27 8 22 2	the bird seems to be self admiring.
2	19 18 10 31 3 13 14 1 5 16 2	The views from m backyard are splendid compared to this trash.
2	9 4 33 1 22 20 28 12 17 23 2	This person will do very bad at this.
2	19 25 21 3 29 5 26 14 20 16 2	I have a boat much bigger than those.
2	11 21 7 14 5 26 29 9 23 24 2	Ugh... swimming in public waters is gross!  I wouldn't be caught dead doing that!
2	14 24 10 15 8 1 6 18 20 11 2	If I was directing this I would have added one more male and female dancer.
2	16 17 5 15 13 25 23 35 33 6 2	This kid isn't nearly as cool or successful as my kids. My kids are the best at everything.
2	29 33 11 31 24 12 3 23 10 27 2	The ones I make at home are much better than these.
2	32 5 14 22 28 12 17 23 21 31 2	I am so much better looking than her.
2	25 18 10 8 35 22 9 3 30 15 2	Wow, she chose those pearls for today? I have much better fashion sense than her.
2	34 11 4 27 17 30 14 33 35 26 2	I could have done a better job of setting up this meeting than whoever designed this.
2	23 4 12 8 24 18 14 3 28 16 2	MY dog could jump over this way better than that dog.
2	18 29 6 21 23 17 34 9 30 28 2	I would have made this presentation more engaging.
2	7 6 24 8 32 30 9 26 31 17 2	I would look better in these boots.
2	18 27 14 13 16 7 12 35 8 28 2	I likw to be alone and i dont care about anyone else. This picture relates so much.
2	13 33 6 5 25 32 12 27 7 18 2	The beauty of nature and the early morning sun
2	20 32 6 23 22 13 3 29 35 8 2	I remember the last time I was in the a tunnel like this.
2	20 14 9 16 15 32 31 5 35 7 2	who would ever use a computer this old
2	5 4 24 15 22 28 7 13 6 25 2	i made everyone of those ugly dolls
2	24 31 6 20 1 19 28 16 7 11 2	when i sing my face looks better then his
2	19 7 5 33 32 24 14 30 26 3 2	My view is much better because there is not a plant in the way.
2	5 26 13 1 25 30 21 7 11 24 2	I don't like places with daily soups.
2	28 14 29 5 23 10 16 24 22 35 2	This picture makes me so uncomfortable, I wish there was more organizaiton.
2	21 35 23 27 22 5 20 26 16 9 2	That block looks like me. I was probably the muse.
2	30 33 29 22 3 9 21 16 31 12 2	These people should move their heads, they are in the way.
2	18 34 11 28 24 21 4 7 35 14 2	I could easily out run the majority of this population.
2	34 33 7 19 32 35 21 15 31 12 2	My pool is better than this
2	27 33 10 3 24 26 21 4 7 13 2	I've seen better trains in cartoons.
2	32 34 12 15 16 5 27 26 11 13 2	I could take a less blurry photo with my eyes closed
2	26 13 7 4 35 22 32 23 31 5 2	They are posing for me, but I don't care about what they are doing.
2	18 32 27 7 21 28 13 5 6 17 2	That grass grows for me
2	1 25 22 16 18 17 30 24 3 14 2	If only people could cook like me
2	13 31 22 6 27 19 12 25 4 1 2	He thinks he is all that.  He's got nothing on me and my superpowers.
2	17 23 24 16 29 20 35 11 10 27 2	This water is so clear, that I bet you could see my perfect skin brilliantly if I were to take a swim in it!
2	24 11 4 18 13 15 10 32 14 21 2	Flowers are only pretty when in a vase.
2	16 25 26 30 34 3 10 31 13 32 2	I am so glad I did not get caught in this picture It looks like pink puked everywhere.
2	26 22 28 18 32 19 30 8 33 27 2	This flower will never live up to the ones I grow.
2	7 28 9 15 18 17 27 10 30 6 2	Yeah well they deserve all the storms they get there, that;s what they get for killing all the trees and not believing global warming is real.
2	8 30 20 9 34 35 19 27 14 33 2	That's a nice hat he's wearing. Too bad it isn't as nice as my fedora.
2	7 20 1 13 32 12 9 33 23 19 2	I prefer pictures that are more appealing to me, this is boring.
2	20 7 17 9 33 18 24 31 4 11 2	My city is much better maintained than this dump of a town.
2	3 16 28 8 18 31 4 29 27 7 2	I could do better line work
2	5 18 16 35 31 10 8 17 7 23 2	I could build it better
2	25 7 19 26 9 12 3 20 24 15 2	My picture should be there not that car
2	28 13 18 12 27 19 8 26 3 25 2	I'm more attractive than all of these people.
2	10 4 5 17 1 23 25 34 15 13 2	What a bunch of losers, I would never do anything like that.
3	4 31 12 5 27 33 7 21 18 32 3	All about money, just what they need, more stores.
3	21 15 22 27 16 2 26 13 1 33 3	hmm so this sold for 25k at Christies?
3	18 1 19 14 35 34 9 30 8 22 3	Two goose arguing infront of a friend.
3	31 32 16 13 25 8 35 27 29 15 3	They sure know how to pick em'.
3	15 35 18 26 8 4 33 21 31 13 3	Oh yeah, this looks like a fun scene :rolls eyes:
3	24 22 35 31 2 5 32 27 16 15 3	This doesn't look boring at all...
3	16 14 30 18 5 22 7 31 29 24 3	Her dress looks backwards to me, what is she drinking?
3	19 33 14 7 32 27 13 24 9 21 3	I see all the food is gone, gee thanks
3	29 22 23 24 30 4 2 9 7 13 3	yeah, that ducks eggs are gold.
3	11 19 7 25 17 4 31 2 15 16 3	I think the person who made the dirt road is snarky
3	33 29 35 31 21 10 14 1 16 9 3	She should wear more red.
3	28 13 20 5 6 31 22 34 4 23 3	Right, people will for sure know what this is.
3	8 27 25 12 20 22 26 18 29 10 3	Do they all need to be up there to speak?
3	11 8 6 22 27 7 9 25 21 24 3	What an interesting picture... not.
3	35 34 12 27 24 21 22 6 23 31 3	Where did all the dead people go?
3	26 20 7 34 23 25 8 11 1 16 3	The firmness and sheer intimidation of law, right? Scary.
3	7 12 6 35 25 22 34 29 9 32 3	Those are two big mirrors.
3	21 13 30 16 11 6 35 31 8 22 3	Just another picture of a mama bird flying away so she doesn't have to listen to her baby birds scream!
3	27 33 11 4 19 13 9 32 8 24 3	What a super cute pic!
3	17 7 20 31 15 13 30 25 14 6 3	Oh really cool paintings, trying to make them look better with a scenic background?
3	32 9 15 18 5 14 27 13 23 26 3	What a beautiful, lush land we have here.
3	22 25 20 31 19 9 2 15 34 18 3	Oh I bet this is the 2013 JCI congress, give me a damn break.
3	24 1 25 35 2 12 8 18 22 5 3	Wow, look how archaic and meaningful this arch is. Wow.
3	12 28 31 19 4 5 34 14 30 18 3	I always love fries topped with ALPO!
3	18 8 28 32 34 31 6 33 10 24 3	The man made a snarky comment
3	15 5 34 24 29 25 13 6 26 30 3	Looks like Princess Fiona for the movie Shrek.
3	1 22 26 27 17 34 6 11 35 12 3	"I love to swim at 5 am," she laughed out loud jokingly.
3	33 27 19 35 18 31 28 26 25 9 3	Those four fighter planes above the parade could be doing something useful elsewhere.
3	26 34 20 5 1 35 32 25 14 31 3	Nice soft and subtle mood lighting pal. I mean, could this be anymore of an obnoxious, contrived and staged photograph?
3	30 17 29 9 26 5 6 20 35 16 3	This looks like a very new type of bowling alley.
3	34 26 28 23 6 21 18 14 24 13 3	Obviously, I can't drive on this bridge.
3	33 26 4 24 15 14 34 8 20 10 3	Right, cause rocks have faces now.
3	16 1 23 14 19 12 26 2 25 32 3	Wearing all black on a sunny day is a great way to stay cool.
3	13 15 2 28 10 1 8 18 30 22 3	Looks like something I built out of Legos as a kid.
3	9 35 10 22 20 32 26 34 12 28 3	What are two poles doing here?
3	15 14 16 19 1 2 28 27 24 23 3	This is a really dull color
3	31 10 21 5 17 8 15 4 16 22 3	I would be snarky to see the jet on the runway and me not in it
3	31 25 13 26 34 16 21 30 6 2 3	The woman might be snarky if someone said she couldn't ride the boat
3	10 14 22 2 17 31 20 13 24 18 3	Well this boat will surely float!
3	21 31 17 13 8 22 18 7 15 20 3	That needs to be cleaned.
3	5 21 27 10 8 28 11 2 1 20 3	Right, cause water should be man created.
3	5 9 14 33 29 15 26 13 27 18 3	I bet the white uniforms really provides good camouflage.
3	15 19 20 32 14 13 30 12 7 23 3	rugby is favourite game ever.
3	18 7 5 26 17 29 14 11 25 9 3	He looks so pale, he needs some sun
3	22 35 14 18 23 32 26 28 21 6 3	The woman is standing outside
3	2 17 11 29 10 1 23 19 34 30 3	the water is so green!
3	33 15 19 29 2 1 18 10 25 14 3	They should add more signs
3	13 11 26 33 5 4 32 30 24 28 3	Great, now Canadian Zombies have a flag.
3	2 34 8 21 28 33 32 15 1 18 3	What a cute baby, better than mom though!
3	17 13 9 28 8 10 26 22 14 23 3	I can't tell if he's in trouble, or if they are!
3	16 8 24 31 35 34 15 22 13 27 3	What is the point of that window?
3	18 11 26 34 35 2 7 17 23 4 3	Nobody wants to smell your bad breath.
3	29 23 7 34 22 1 27 14 31 28 3	The structure looks brand new.
3	28 33 21 15 11 18 27 2 24 30 3	I guess even Santa needs a cigarette break sometimes.
3	21 8 10 31 18 12 22 1 33 14 3	I bet he doesn't even like her.
3	15 11 19 20 33 9 25 7 31 28 3	He could have taken off the shades for the photo.
3	8 24 10 7 28 11 15 19 13 18 3	He probably needs those because he's so short.
3	13 14 12 15 28 9 19 21 8 24 3	Cloudy weather again. We could totally use more clouds here. Great.
3	9 25 2 20 6 11 15 18 13 29 3	I feel like I'm blind in here.
3	17 1 4 9 32 5 10 21 23 12 3	It looks like someone forgot to pressure wash.
3	16 26 17 9 4 24 14 28 27 20 3	What is he looking at?
3	22 31 10 8 18 2 4 1 7 33 3	I'm sure she's a virgin.
3	19 11 10 29 9 34 4 30 1 26 3	This doesn't look dangerous at all.
3	31 5 1 34 23 33 11 28 30 19 3	Well that's one way to wallpaper a room.
3	32 27 6 22 19 33 5 30 14 21 3	I'm sure he washed his hands first.
3	26 24 15 31 35 33 7 30 12 16 3	Oh of course you would do that!
3	35 14 24 33 6 16 29 27 5 26 3	Does this place have a Starbucks?
3	21 29 4 27 28 8 15 25 10 9 3	What a great group of athletes
3	1 24 7 35 14 33 2 26 29 10 3	Fog is soooo dangerous, not!
3	5 11 34 13 15 21 19 27 2 29 3	Oh wow, this town looks soooo interesting and exciting.  Ugh, give me a break.
3	12 30 19 35 26 18 23 25 11 31 3	It looks like that lady is totally having a good time with that clown.
3	35 10 7 1 8 2 14 9 18 12 3	Wow, /great/ stance on that bike, mate.
3	24 10 1 34 4 6 14 31 21 23 3	Oooh, I'm so scared. What a scary monster.
3	32 17 30 12 23 16 14 5 34 15 3	Don't drop that water bottle!
3	33 23 35 11 20 7 4 22 17 18 3	omg...pick a color....or is it open season?
3	28 23 18 13 1 21 26 22 9 16 3	Dude seems like a good place to throw a partyy
3	25 1 7 21 12 29 23 2 15 33 3	Perhaps you should climb with your teeth if you are going to use them to carry your shoes anyway
3	20 10 8 29 33 6 22 18 19 9 3	What is he doing playing football?
3	31 26 23 30 6 12 20 11 15 32 3	I could totally swing higher than that.
3	16 2 17 10 31 12 11 1 25 32 3	It is only one kid looking at all the others.
3	20 29 26 6 14 28 1 33 22 13 3	wow. this guy is sooooooo handsome. yikes
3	13 22 7 25 1 19 8 18 20 33 3	Do you really think thats going to fit you?
3	11 23 22 30 31 25 18 29 7 21 3	Could this house be compensating for something?
3	24 2 18 13 9 15 28 29 21 25 3	i'm sure they are really unhappy and depressed.
3	14 32 35 21 18 15 6 9 4 20 3	Glad to see that these two went to a nice restaurant for lunch.
3	28 35 27 21 16 4 24 20 12 29 3	Give me more, because I really really dont like wine.
3	28 27 10 2 30 13 26 34 11 25 3	I know you like walking at night because you say it's peaceful, but you've heard about werewolves, right?
3	5 31 1 32 4 28 2 14 8 12 3	I bet that is a rea
3	19 22 29 4 13 1 14 2 34 11 3	Don't we all have lakehouses?
3	29 28 33 31 14 9 2 15 19 10 3	This guy is a beauty pageant winner.
3	8 7 21 18 13 14 2 31 34 19 3	That is a very nice costume.
3	1 28 30 8 20 13 33 32 14 11 3	This is such a interesting diagram.
3	7 29 10 12 14 5 17 8 25 35 3	Like wow.....that thing is so big, I bet it means they're sooo important.  More important than the presidents of all of the countries combined!
3	34 29 24 10 23 25 7 28 17 30 3	This is my best friend, and a lover too! hehe :D
3	1 8 6 7 27 21 17 28 2 4 3	Ugh, not another nice day of weather! Those flowers are not perfect enough.
3	1 6 28 11 25 19 27 17 12 4 3	This looks like a choppy voyage!
3	25 2 33 4 11 28 1 9 7 32 3	It's a good thing the statue is so well focused.
3	35 16 8 33 13 17 23 28 31 24 3	He must be hunting zombies with that barb wired baseball bat!
3	27 5 31 22 12 23 30 15 26 21 3	Gee, that sure looks like a fancy bike!
3	29 35 22 34 9 10 13 28 14 1 3	Wow, look at that tiny waterfall.
3	2 8 34 31 14 20 32 27 23 10 3	Yeah I'm sure whatever is in that building is worth all the interest.
3	34 6 24 14 25 23 30 4 20 31 3	Those green beans look very good...
3	15 13 31 23 14 33 34 30 12 16 3	Yeah, dude, you're totally blending in with those girls
3	31 22 27 16 17 8 25 19 11 1 3	Looks like the endless summer finally came to an end for those surfers.
3	17 10 12 21 33 25 24 1 31 19 3	This is a bizarre courtroom.
3	19 23 29 5 7 21 8 9 34 16 3	If you're going to take a picture, maybe make it something meaningful.
3	5 32 29 31 35 12 1 9 21 8 3	Are you bale to see anything,i don't?
3	6 28 27 2 24 8 11 12 10 31 3	No light in this house
3	20 12 19 29 34 27 13 8 15 26 3	He looks like a monster wolf.
3	10 9 27 1 18 6 7 8 16 20 3	Wow, spotless. No rust there at all.
3	9 28 1 2 22 16 4 8 19 32 3	Could you have at least given the girl a bigger pumpkin to carve!
3	9 29 22 35 15 33 20 32 21 6 3	Wow I have to climb like 3 steps nice this won't hurt my legs at all.
3	31 10 24 5 15 2 25 33 7 13 3	No one needs that many bags.  Well maybe if his girlfriend just kicked him to the curb.
3	33 4 1 2 26 14 16 8 21 18 3	She must have the Hope Diamond.
3	9 7 1 34 22 31 6 26 28 4 3	Wow I can really see so much.
3	9 18 5 35 10 11 22 29 7 21 3	This looks a fun spot to swim.
3	27 19 2 23 30 35 14 21 22 24 3	He looks so cold in that.
3	4 26 15 29 35 30 25 23 22 2 3	Does he think that that jacket looks good on him? Man, what a genius.
3	29 27 8 5 2 6 24 21 1 35 3	They look like amazing athletes...
3	7 31 18 21 10 4 35 26 19 20 3	Those coats aren't bright enough. NOT.
3	13 6 27 19 35 7 8 2 29 4 3	And that, folks, is what happens when you eat too many marshmallows
3	26 14 34 29 32 28 19 11 6 13 3	It's a shame that a 1st grader designed that bridge.
3	15 31 7 14 13 25 11 8 28 32 3	Elat Earthers what now ?
3	8 12 31 15 32 5 18 9 13 35 3	It's raining cats and dogs!
3	11 31 16 33 10 1 2 5 17 34 3	Dogs will be dogs...not babies.  This woman has the dog in the stroller. Gheez!
3	14 32 17 22 33 27 11 20 30 28 3	short shorts and boots! please
3	21 2 29 24 14 5 15 16 22 4 3	Result a picture of nothing
3	28 20 23 33 24 5 1 15 2 18 3	Why did you but that
3	25 23 24 1 32 17 31 10 15 13 3	Oh yeah, sure. Point up. They totally care.
3	20 19 12 9 14 33 28 2 5 22 3	Oh look, two dogs staring into space.  How interesting.
3	22 12 15 19 2 13 23 6 18 1 3	That one white uniform player is really gonna stand a chance against those three other players.
3	22 32 24 18 14 5 10 35 11 25 3	Could this picture be more zoomed out on the subjects?
3	7 25 4 29 22 33 21 23 1 32 3	Running of the rhinos or running of the idiots.
3	13 28 8 19 25 35 5 15 7 10 3	This s like a corn maze, but with statues.
3	10 23 16 14 8 21 4 29 24 30 3	That dude's not loving that moment! Not at all.
3	27 7 32 28 33 24 26 30 19 13 3	This chair is either covered in snow or the snow is covered in the chair.
3	23 10 25 33 9 29 22 20 1 8 3	Sure, I'd LOVE for you poke me in the eye, it would feel great!
3	6 29 4 5 7 14 28 26 24 17 3	King Penguin would be better than King Cheeto that we've got now.
3	16 7 25 4 1 26 19 15 24 32 3	Bet that little spider is going to wish he wasn't a male in about five minutes.
3	18 5 19 34 17 4 11 8 35 24 3	Oh, yes, we're just SO hip, sitting here watching people go by!
3	21 5 8 1 34 13 15 14 10 6 3	This is a brand new car.
3	19 23 10 12 25 28 33 1 6 14 3	Powerlines in front of a sunset? Seriously? Tacky.
3	30 27 32 1 10 22 33 9 18 21 3	This car will fly away.
3	13 2 15 21 11 9 20 25 29 34 3	He just lost the lottery.
3	6 25 9 17 15 20 5 13 29 35 3	What a happy looking family!
3	21 34 14 30 4 19 25 11 32 17 3	That creature doesn't look gross at all and I can definitely tell what it is.
3	21 17 18 2 28 14 6 16 19 29 3	Nice little pool they have got there.
3	9 31 1 29 21 33 15 20 8 19 3	The crowd is too big.
3	34 9 30 31 4 20 7 17 21 15 3	Well that seems like a safe idea.
3	23 10 20 7 13 8 25 15 32 16 3	Is that baby drinking milk or acting fake?
3	8 17 15 14 30 24 16 32 4 7 3	I always love going on the bus, it's so clean and wonderful...
3	33 35 28 22 17 31 25 5 13 23 3	Kid:  Hey mom, look at me on the slide...Mom:  Hold up, I'm busy staring at the sky.
3	23 29 12 4 11 6 16 26 8 32 3	What is that a baby banana
3	1 26 34 18 16 27 7 8 31 6 3	If you're reading this sign, it's already too late.
3	2 4 29 35 10 17 23 22 12 18 3	white flowers.. i bet they dont deserve the colour.. infact , much better ones
3	2 25 33 8 16 6 13 34 28 23 3	Look at all the missiles exploding in the air.
3	19 18 10 29 17 30 24 14 7 4 3	Well I bet this is tasty even if it does look like puke.
3	1 32 31 15 14 27 29 7 22 4 3	Looks like this person's lost.
3	23 7 6 31 8 2 24 5 28 27 3	William Wallace was such a great man he got a plaque.  NOT.
3	15 8 1 26 28 22 34 32 11 30 3	Little yellow food, I mean fish.
3	12 17 11 31 35 21 13 10 15 23 3	This looks like a big race.  A race for the loser of the other big race.
3	5 1 23 25 8 14 32 18 19 6 3	Wonderful picture. I'm green with envy...

5	11 27 17 9 31 8 28 12 25 3 5	I am so happy these trinkets exist.
5	34 18 14 35 2 3 26 22 15 11 5	Another day ends with another in the works.  Thankful to live.
5	30 7 19 6 13 29 21 27 16 8 5	I had a bunny as a kid who was my best friend
5	25 24 11 29 19 12 28 18 31 30 5	These buses are way better. Twice the passengers.
5	1 25 33 26 24 34 8 27 13 23 5	This guy works out just to help his team, bless him.
5	18 14 29 27 7 13 4 32 16 8 5	I appreciate how hard they work at training.
5	20 23 24 18 25 21 32 22 28 16 5	I give her credit for the hard work she put in achieving this look.
5	6 21 30 23 27 20 13 1 14 17 5	What a nice and selfless this it is for that man to help move that dryer!
5	12 24 32 1 25 34 11 7 21 33 5	I sure am glad I don't to worry about that kind of maintenance where I live.
5	23 8 17 21 11 9 30 14 29 25 5	I am so happy to live in a place where it never snows.
5	29 15 7 10 32 28 18 23 8 11 5	We are thankful to god for giving us the human race!
6	3 22 33 35 34 11 29 9 12 17 6	This would be a good spot for hide and seek.
6	30 18 4 29 35 32 3 9 16 25 6	I think I see the Loch Ness Monster under the water.
6	26 33 22 32 31 35 11 17 13 18 6	The Flute Skill Bridge is an amazing thing! On a windy day, as one balances and walks across, the music tones change. Skilled walkers can be musicians with their feet!
6	22 26 4 29 19 34 8 28 5 1 6	We could use an engine like this to fuel our spaceship and take it to Jupiter.
6	18 15 29 31 21 22 8 34 13 26 6	That looks like a huge spider!
6	10 23 35 7 20 30 29 3 24 17 6	Ingenious is all I can say about this waterfall
6	18 23 7 13 3 34 11 14 16 9 6	I can just imagine boarding a boat and sailing off the coast of this beautiful place.
6	34 12 13 30 5 8 32 23 1 27 6	To you this might be a picture of people cave exploring, but to me this is a humanoid group of defense agents working to rescue their compatriot from an alien rock monster!
6	8 30 34 33 9 5 28 25 16 21 6	Thinking hot wings with beer
6	4 23 31 25 10 19 8 17 29 14 6	These work powerpoints are so bland.  If I was making them it would be much more engaing.
6	21 32 34 17 15 13 20 27 11 22 6	It reminds me of a pacman ghost
6	1 4 18 9 7 25 26 22 14 8 6	I could eat that whole cake and then run a marathon.
6	8 18 24 12 26 34 27 5 30 31 6	If I owned this, I would turn it in to a Harry Potter castle!
6	26 21 30 20 7 23 14 13 18 28 6	Close up picture of the freshly painted side of my house.
6	2 5 7 22 35 24 19 15 9 13 6	I wonder what they're burying....
6	27 8 30 29 25 35 1 34 22 26 6	I didn't do this, but I have been known to write/draw on tabletops.
6	21 5 15 18 28 25 7 11 3 12 6	I wonder if boats come in here
6	32 7 24 25 34 8 30 29 26 21 6	I could paint my whole house a nice shade of yellow!
6	12 34 8 13 3 29 20 35 25 22 6	If flowers were planted here, it would help the eco-system.
6	17 2 25 9 34 5 24 31 29 35 6	What a beautiful lake! I can imagine myself paddling the day away,daydreaming in the sunshine.
6	4 32 11 9 7 27 15 18 30 5 6	This is the best movie i've seen.
6	29 17 5 24 27 31 28 20 10 12 6	It's like the monument reaches the clouds.
6	9 27 22 1 12 16 35 34 32 3 6	I made some chips similar to these from scratch.  They were very tasty.
6	25 34 28 14 7 35 2 16 21 17 6	Anything is possible within this city of opportunity as long as you can dream.
6	23 31 35 15 20 24 22 33 28 8 6	Many nights people spend in here conversing here and forming new friendships.
6	14 5 21 8 22 34 7 12 13 31 6	I can just picture myself eating plates of amazing colorful foods of all kinds. Yum!!
6	35 9 12 4 5 23 30 11 14 27 6	Really took some thought for those lines.
6	26 5 11 23 9 35 13 1 12 27 6	getting ready to win the race
6	9 3 18 34 7 31 10 2 20 4 6	A pattern of pink letters of a name would go great with cross stitching!
6	14 18 27 22 4 11 23 29 21 32 6	The lizard king in camouflage awaiting night fall to change back into human form
6	3 1 17 26 32 14 31 22 18 25 6	THe circles look like a cd
6	4 23 33 32 19 12 10 3 9 18 6	Purple is a cool color
6	35 7 24 27 31 14 16 3 20 13 6	The woods are home to many unseen creatures at any moment, especially the night.
6	13 1 9 32 31 18 27 8 21 15 6	I think they might be at the fairgrounds in my home town.
6	20 3 16 31 7 18 26 24 8 11 6	I believe the colored lights signify something more going on
6	20 33 26 14 34 32 24 10 29 27 6	What are the plans for?
6	26 18 19 11 8 28 24 22 3 20 6	What happens if god was one of us?
6	4 24 35 8 23 3 22 20 32 9 6	Is it a bridge, or a house, or a house on a bridge
6	10 8 7 31 33 19 1 29 20 21 6	What sort of noodles could they be?
6	20 14 1 33 10 7 22 12 23 31 6	I wonder what this peacock would say if it could talk.
6	21 12 7 17 15 35 26 28 13 31 6	I bet the view from the fence was disappointing.
6	11 16 17 19 13 15 22 2 14 20 6	Just imagine what it is they are doing.
6	22 23 15 29 11 24 14 30 2 16 6	That is probably the worlds best looking egg roll
6	15 18 24 30 12 7 14 23 5 10 6	This looks so old and cool
6	3 35 23 2 22 8 34 4 24 12 6	These guys are long lost twins.
6	14 30 11 22 35 2 16 9 19 29 6	Imagie being able to fly above the trees and look down upon them? That would be awesome.
6	25 14 4 35 8 30 13 15 20 10 6	With a little work, this could be an epic food truck!
6	33 34 10 30 35 17 29 7 3 22 6	The different numbers should be different colors to give a wide array of visual depth.
6	33 13 22 15 31 16 26 5 29 30 6	there is a dragon lair under the waterfall.
6	11 22 30 2 25 34 14 18 26 17 6	Is this the set for Cowboys vs. Dinosaurs?
6	26 18 23 27 28 33 4 32 14 2 6	She's going to win this game, then go on to save the universe one day from an evil alien overlord.
6	28 10 13 21 12 18 29 11 33 1 6	When I look at him all I can think of is him flying through the air about to take down some supernatural monsters.
6	27 10 9 25 2 18 19 24 16 33 6	This seal is posing for the cameras.
6	34 5 10 25 29 30 11 12 35 19 6	If the fountains would shoot up green and red water, it would make for a beautiful Christmas backdrop.
6	35 5 30 18 1 9 22 25 34 14 6	If only we could spread our arms and soar through here!
6	8 29 22 33 13 4 16 12 10 7 6	These fish are almost invisible.
6	20 31 1 8 23 5 19 24 3 2 6	I hope they aren't worried about those aliens overhead.
6	10 2 33 22 3 8 27 15 25 18 6	If we dream it we can build it!
6	30 12 8 21 28 13 15 10 23 19 6	This solid expanse of bright green makes one think of the infinite
6	27 5 29 19 1 18 26 7 32 12 6	I wonder if these posters help any?
6	3 19 31 2 27 15 20 1 28 11 6	I wonder how they will fall.
6	27 28 25 12 15 22 35 8 5 16 6	This city block looks full of interesting things to do - I would love to take an afternoon and explore it!
6	3 32 11 15 35 13 21 31 1 30 6	Must be a heavenly place for grasshoppers to wander about.
6	35 34 19 2 27 7 11 17 4 15 6	This looks like a very interesting class that I can learn a lot in.
6	16 12 11 13 14 4 17 15 23 19 6	The wonder is displayed in the sparks.
6	3 14 25 12 10 22 26 32 9 33 6	I bet he is thinking about base jumping off.
6	2 14 29 20 17 15 3 25 33 9 6	Maybe it will grow up to be the best
6	25 8 10 23 16 17 2 26 11 31 6	I imagine that they are drinking wine and trying to decide on the next president
6	26 28 25 27 19 12 10 7 13 20 6	This car could grow wings and fly!
6	28 19 15 24 11 17 4 25 10 1 6	Halloween anyone? oh its june
6	24 9 13 8 4 10 30 33 23 27 6	The sky is truly amazing when it can shine so bright.

6	33 17 12 5 11 13 23 27 14 16 6	I  would love to enjoy that nice cruise someday
6	13 4 3 35 25 26 31 11 10 29 6	Hope that robot isn't steal all the candy!
6	29 2 31 9 5 22 14 35 19 11 6	What a great idea: making a calendar out of your holiday snaps.
6	4 5 32 27 28 25 8 30 17 7 6	make sure you all keep behind the circle, you'll turn into a giraffe if you cross too soon
6	15 30 18 22 11 3 26 35 28 1 6	I could climb this hill all day.
6	5 15 9 4 3 7 14 12 21 22 6	All this needs is a vase and it would be worthy of a contemporary portrait!
6	16 14 22 3 35 25 29 10 34 4 6	I can only imagine all this tree has seen.
6	7 23 22 33 2 17 3 32 28 5 6	I think those plants are talking to each other.\
6	27 14 30 35 1 5 11 29 13 15 6	I wonder what game they might be playing?
6	22 7 2 9 29 10 32 13 35 1 6	Always wonderful to meet someone important.
6	4 21 19 24 29 9 1 25 22 34 6	I can write a great poem here.
6	15 16 2 26 31 8 12 32 14 21 6	I'D LOVE TO CLEAN THIS PLACE UP AND TURN IT INTO A PLAYGROUND
6	33 2 9 13 20 4 11 16 12 29 6	Great shot -- it looks like a portal to another world!
6	29 10 26 21 23 11 19 13 24 18 6	Take the older mans hair and put on the younger man.
6	35 2 24 26 15 1 20 22 33 11 6	Now that George Lucas is not longer the owner of the Star Wars franchise, he has taken up the hobby of licking wine glasses.
6	19 14 12 18 8 30 24 25 4 29 6	I guess this vehicle is from India, I think so!
6	11 10 31 9 20 19 23 33 13 8 6	I have heard theat Shakespeare slept here
6	29 17 4 9 1 32 10 11 12 30 6	There are fairies in the trees!
6	15 27 21 22 12 8 31 17 18 29 6	All the ducks are not in a row.

6	12 20 17 11 14 7 25 28 27 4 6	I can imagine dancing through the streets of Jamaica.
6	14 20 5 9 23 26 7 22 13 32 6	Doesn't this look like a bored robot face?
6	28 8 2 35 4 12 29 15 17 18 6	Imagine what the sky over the city would like filled with birds!
6	17 20 5 26 28 25 22 1 8 16 6	I bet they are singing a Wiggles children's song.
6	3 14 11 12 17 19 2 35 22 21 6	Even though I know this person is blurred due to the camera I still think it looks like an impressionistic painting
6	27 12 33 16 26 14 24 5 10 4 6	This would make a nice tablecloth color.
6	34 1 5 9 3 24 16 23 14 33 6	It's possible to use your fingers to judge the time until the sun sets.
6	2 34 1 4 20 15 18 23 16 13 6	That looks like an awesome party in that photo.
6	14 7 13 32 26 5 34 19 9 22 6	I would love to paint a mural on that wall!
6	35 32 4 25 2 28 3 19 9 13 6	They are going to win the championship!

6	9 24 33 26 23 1 22 28 18 32 6	This must have come from an ancient city.
6	16 28 14 34 21 32 23 13 3 22 6	These flowers will once day live forever.
6	26 13 31 2 10 8 22 32 14 25 6	I wonder if this is a pink paint in a room for a princess.
6	17 3 24 16 5 1 15 32 14 26 6	I can envision my own store within the shopping mall already.
6	5 28 29 12 31 27 3 18 7 32 6	Lots of camping and outdoors items.
6	35 13 16 15 21 2 1 30 28 31 6	The rest of these girls will get married.
6	3 21 5 25 9 18 33 30 23 20 6	I wonder what kind of mods that bike has. I imagine it's had work done on at least the body
6	5 19 16 30 34 29 28 8 3 10 6	That must have been a really informative meeting.
6	12 20 8 11 13 21 4 22 27 30 6	What a perfect place to capture a memory of childhood.
6	34 10 17 25 11 26 12 20 19 23 6	You look like you are dreaming of your future career.
6	1 35 16 9 18 26 32 3 27 21 6	I wanna take that train on a trip
6	3 18 29 25 21 32 16 14 5 20 6	Welcome to Fairy Land's cafe, one of the market placed themed cafes for the fairies in Fairy Land.
6	32 34 25 28 14 8 29 26 17 11 6	This looks like 3 generations of women in the family capturing a moment of achievement and quality time. Happy days!
6	13 30 3 5 12 9 10 2 22 23 6	This could be for the goal.  They could win millions.
6	9 10 31 17 4 35 28 7 2 25 6	There must be 1 million people at this holiday celebration.
6	34 12 31 35 29 30 24 9 16 4 6	Do you Like my hat
6	1 31 11 13 18 7 30 17 9 32 6	I've tall building about all others
6	8 5 10 22 16 31 7 35 14 24 6	It looks like a mix of soccer and hockey! How cool. I can just see myself being the mascot.
6	29 24 22 2 19 25 18 30 1 12 6	I bet he has that cup entirely filled up with roasted peanuts. Maybe in his baseball cap too
6	25 24 11 33 34 14 17 35 19 27 6	A surreal image from a play in motion and light.
6	15 3 18 11 21 30 27 26 7 17 6	This is my dream house. One where I will raise 4 children with the perfect husband.
6	29 2 20 1 11 15 23 34 35 22 6	i am imaging the feel  bee eat
6	9 21 29 8 30 3 18 26 16 19 6	I wonder what we could box like this?
6	20 19 35 8 29 3 21 27 5 9 6	Can a bird fly right into this area?
6	9 2 30 5 18 19 28 7 33 23 6	I wonder if this is during a glorious butterfly festival convention.
6	34 23 32 33 30 1 9 2 15 28 6	Ooh, I could do with a drink looking at this!
6	23 35 30 11 16 25 1 15 24 26 6	Wonder if these are tourists trying to figure out how they could leave theirs lives to live in a foreign country off the grid.
6	20 25 15 13 29 21 4 10 7 31 6	Look at the brooms giants left sticking up from the ground!
6	28 24 25 11 1 27 30 16 18 10 6	This helicopter is flying back in time.
6	13 25 18 19 32 12 14 21 8 1 6	This is such a fairy looking landscape. That water is probably a portal!
6	20 7 12 27 2 8 17 14 13 28 6	This tree is so blustery.
6	13 12 8 4 15 10 7 25 35 19 6	I wonder if a wizard is going to appear on his broom to grab this key.
6	19 33 4 17 27 28 34 24 13 14 6	So many wonderful songs to play, so little time!
6	31 33 11 2 3 15 5 23 28 24 6	I could add so many different things to this! I just wanna reach out and touch it!
6	3 9 26 7 29 27 28 25 32 17 6	The runner looks like she just finished at least a mile run.
6	35 30 21 19 8 5 14 4 24 15 6	How sophisticated the cloud formation seems to be in here
6	5 32 16 15 31 4 1 30 18 35 6	I think he had an accident in his pants
6	5 10 17 33 22 8 7 32 1 15 6	He's going to change the world.
6	14 9 16 23 18 11 10 27 28 12 6	The neighborhood offered more than one job opportunity
6	26 13 17 14 32 34 10 22 20 19 6	She's picking up her imaginary kitty kat.
6	23 34 28 27 12 33 5 11 15 35 6	Harry Potter might have read that book.
6	27 32 5 21 33 15 9 11 16 30 6	Think of all the places that plane has traveled
6	18 23 26 11 1 27 20 8 17 5 6	I bet that woman is exhausted!
6	5 23 24 28 15 8 31 11 2 34 6	He's probably playing darude sandstorm
6	3 10 32 27 1 22 12 5 21 31 6	It's like a little oasis in your bathroom.
6	11 12 8 1 32 7 28 22 25 24 6	I bet the inside looks like a quaint, stereotypical little writer's study
6	15 16 22 11 8 9 10 18 19 33 6	The area is like a scene from a movie with mythical creatures.
6	16 19 15 2 9 26 17 5 23 24 6	This could easily make a great album cover.
6	4 21 1 12 35 3 2 18 7 16 6	This one would have so many stories to tell.
6	1 31 34 27 19 28 13 26 25 9 6	I think he spelled Hogie wrong ... mmmm Hogie
6	26 12 23 34 22 24 27 11 8 19 6	This is probably Beyonce's house.
6	26 22 3 28 5 11 16 31 35 23 6	She looks like a good time

7	1 5 9 12 33 3 21 17 14 30 7	I know this place is just decent.
7	13 14 28 26 18 21 24 2 16 34 7	Bad picture, the shadow ruins it
7	15 21 12 25 18 26 5 19 2 33 7	I just think lines and the color red are just so boring.

7	10 15 29 16 32 8 34 30 11 31 7	Why would you even post this?

7	4 34 1 17 27 32 10 14 16 21 7	For one, he shouldn't be playing indoors. I don't think he knows what he's doing.
7	18 29 25 20 15 33 28 34 31 32 7	I've been there so many times I've lost count.
7	27 35 31 24 18 9 34 29 10 15 7	They're a cute couple, but I am much better looking.

7	26 17 13 31 20 24 14 35 18 12 7	They can't do something to make this street look better?
7	19 31 3 11 8 28 30 35 32 5 7	She should wear better colors, ew.

7	22 3 21 28 8 18 33 17 11 1 7	Those little trinkets on display aren't worth very much on my opinion.
7	30 13 16 12 31 1 17 11 15 18 7	Oh please, let me come over there and knock that stupid hat off of your head.
7	35 32 25 21 13 11 14 16 10 3 7	My baby is cuter than yours.
7	32 11 23 35 15 4 6 13 30 3 7	Why is he looking at me like that?I don't like it at all.

7	35 22 24 15 23 12 1 19 32 3 7	This telescope is assembled all wrong. If they'd have bothered to ask me, I would have told them how to do it correctly.
7	23 3 21 19 31 14 1 15 33 13 7	I hope that they know that any possible productivity will be negated by the sugar crash from drinking that Coca Cola.
7	16 18 19 26 15 31 23 3 17 13 7	These ladies could use some more makeup.

7	30 32 14 9 13 6 11 18 35 26 7	That floor must be really special
7	18 16 3 17 34 21 25 31 15 10 7	I would never sit there. So boring.
7	33 12 1 16 35 21 6 5 22 15 7	So we're now going to objectify kids toys? Grow up!
7	13 2 22 20 23 4 1 26 21 33 7	I could have done a better job than this painter. Mine would have looked better.
7	19 26 35 33 34 6 20 16 29 4 7	I could braid way better than that.

7	4 20 29 10 21 3 23 6 32 22 7	Elves could barely deliver the goods, so they were replaced with better management.

7	35 25 1 22 21 17 20 14 32 30 7	Clean up these wheels a bit, will you!

10	14 29 18 11 17 5 20 30 27 15 10	This camera is probably 1000, but i'd buy it!
10	33 9 30 19 18 29 32 31 3 2 10	I think that dog is actually a cat.
10	28 21 19 25 3 13 1 27 20 11 10	It is unreasonable to be out this late at night
10	24 6 16 22 30 28 32 20 14 15 10	It does not make sense to live here
10	19 11 12 6 26 33 29 4 27 16 10	Seeing a green bird is always a sign that you'll have a bad day.
10	9 26 32 15 13 14 33 30 11 7 10	Wow I bet this car has enough horsepower to win a NASCAR race!
10	35 25 9 30 29 23 18 7 16 32 10	I should slide down the table and slap every man sitting there.
10	3 7 15 20 28 1 13 26 33 12 10	They are a really terrible team.
10	5 15 35 13 25 33 14 1 20 7 10	It just ridiculous to put your head this close to another person, head lice anyone.
10	13 2 33 14 11 12 3 4 17 19 10	It is not rational to sit the entire game
10	34 22 18 19 16 25 13 31 26 5 10	The mother looks on in disbelief at the fathers groundless claims
10	8 33 30 6 7 19 17 26 20 3 10	Take some sushi with you so you can give it to me after your flight!
10	25 17 18 28 14 15 7 2 12 19 10	I hate this color. It reminds me of urine
10	1 15 23 21 25 31 5 17 8 29 10	This building is haunted! Don't ask me why, I just know! I can sense it.
10	30 22 23 21 32 31 24 14 28 8 10	They give me a blank canvas with no pencil.
10	17 35 25 33 6 34 28 14 23 12 10	strawberries are the worst fruit!
10	33 17 14 1 22 25 11 29 26 9 10	I'm sure they'd play even in the rain, crazy.
10	25 8 18 9 2 12 15 23 22 35 10	Wow, those people over there in the corner are going to come running at me at any moment!
10	16 33 31 23 9 7 34 24 19 26 10	I have no idea what they're trying to do here, but it looks like they're failing to me.
10	25 21 11 35 1 14 32 27 18 22 10	The backgorund light is making me crazy
10	35 19 11 32 25 23 12 34 21 3 10	That vehicle will probably be crushed by the building!
10	27 34 14 7 25 18 20 31 28 11 10	Would thesthesde darn car get off my fricking road!!
10	1 32 24 17 9 4 27 8 33 3 10	She's going to try eating that.
10	27 2 35 23 16 21 15 30 9 8 10	Is this for customers that need to wait? I don't see why they would have to wait on the top rack.
10	25 28 26 5 2 20 33 9 3 23 10	lets jump in the gcar and make a get awayu
10	21 9 33 13 32 15 35 34 26 6 10	What why is the chair in plastic?
10	6 1 27 26 34 8 22 23 19 4 10	books that is yet to be read
10	18 35 12 29 13 20 9 14 6 5 10	Why is he laughing, I bet nobody else is.
10	34 32 22 15 8 21 19 1 24 30 10	This place will never sell. No one wants to live here
10	28 26 7 8 25 11 1 13 17 6 10	Those people on the lift are going to plummet to their death! the worse always happens and too many innocent lives will come to an end because of it!
10	31 23 19 15 35 30 32 7 27 12 10	If the food is just sitting there like that, it must be free.
10	22 24 8 12 28 17 26 9 16 14 10	this isnt a buckeyes house
10	31 8 17 29 22 30 24 20 23 19 10	That dog has a really short tail
10	1 23 13 26 24 12 32 16 5 34 10	It is not possi ble for me to come there in these heels
10	23 22 12 17 1 3 6 25 15 9 10	If you try hard enough you should be able to have the place cleared out within a few hours.
10	31 2 19 18 7 32 1 21 33 12 10	Why is she drinking beer in the middle of winter?
10	11 22 2 19 23 8 20 25 26 18 10	That giant rat better not escape or it might destroy those little buildings in the background.
10	5 11 18 30 3 4 1 35 13 26 10	I could swim out to those rocks. The current is strong but I am a stronger swimmer.
10	17 15 9 12 32 13 34 4 33 16 10	Are they going to a Harry Potter convention?
10	3 30 11 20 29 12 28 6 1 21 10	What are these idiots smiling at?
10	33 3 14 26 29 12 20 2 35 27 10	This ladies make up looks like whoa amateur style
10	4 22 31 27 12 20 34 11 29 5 10	It's not healthy to wear that metal so close to the skin like that.
10	5 27 1 14 31 20 3 32 21 4 10	Did this guy use too much laundry detergent?
10	25 9 2 30 5 14 27 11 35 3 10	She should buy some fireworks.
10	14 9 1 17 22 21 8 16 2 3 10	Are these kids getting ready for motorcross or what?  Why do they need all that gear to play hockey?
10	33 34 17 15 3 20 7 35 26 27 10	I bet this has never been touched
10	22 33 2 14 11 5 23 17 35 15 10	Why are these guys sitting there doing nothing? They should be working instead of protesting.
10	14 15 2 23 28 4 18 31 19 3 10	Is there more than one Superman?
10	20 22 3 34 25 7 35 26 13 21 10	Those people should watch out!  Those cars behind them are likely to run them over if they're not careful
10	7 4 16 6 1 14 13 20 24 12 10	that's not a piece of paper. It is book being that she looks puzzled.
10	15 33 3 13 34 35 7 17 31 2 10	This is not such a beautiful flower.
10	32 23 29 28 4 11 17 1 26 30 10	What kind of revolution are we talking here, the Che type or other?
10	22 8 5 18 12 6 17 19 26 15 10	It's very strange that someone decided to chisel these strange rock formations in the way that they did.
10	14 22 29 24 20 32 13 34 21 7 10	Why didn't they finish their legs.
10	34 26 1 28 15 2 5 31 27 9 10	Why am I doing this!
10	23 9 34 17 20 19 18 2 5 29 10	next play is for a touchdow
10	9 23 33 26 2 12 4 35 3 15 10	That's so ugly. I don't get it.
10	29 6 19 24 15 35 18 22 25 1 10	What is the deal with these statues anyways?
10	30 25 7 14 1 18 29 9 24 17 10	I would so jump from one of these lifts.
10	22 20 11 34 16 32 12 31 26 15 10	He is going to hit her!
10	23 21 28 29 19 12 15 33 13 6 10	This looks like a prison cell.
10	4 35 22 1 16 6 27 34 28 26 10	She can stare all day but the painting will not move.
10	29 12 11 26 25 9 31 14 23 19 10	AHHHH, fire bad!  Fire bad!!
10	3 12 6 23 9 31 16 8 35 32 10	Um, drive-in concession? Rest room?
10	22 30 21 19 25 14 2 33 16 20 10	Crazy thoughts are clearly going through this bird's mind.
10	33 23 7 4 27 20 11 24 6 21 10	I would paint those fork lifts pink
10	27 32 20 7 6 2 4 3 17 5 10	This schedule is way too hard to read. There should be a city employee at each stop who can tell you when the next bus is coming and where it's going to.
10	16 12 24 5 17 21 28 27 32 25 10	I could live out here in the snow with no heating or house!
10	7 22 12 26 13 30 17 18 5 2 10	Stop clipping! These poor animals deserve the self respect of keeping what's given to them by nature
10	19 15 34 13 16 6 1 8 23 21 10	the best place to hear this will be the very back row
10	21 34 25 13 24 27 3 32 7 12 10	Seems like a perfectly good place to put that.
10	9 32 30 25 22 33 16 18 23 13 10	Is that a little boy? or a girl?
10	25 3 30 4 19 35 27 14 1 15 10	It is ilogic to think about a race where the woman in white wins.
10	20 17 21 34 25 26 2 35 3 7 10	Why do the flowers no match the table cloth, let alone the flash is shown on the wall in the photo?
10	26 9 20 33 8 1 4 22 15 18 10	I dont think thats an accurtate scene.
10	14 2 28 13 16 27 9 33 7 3 10	I don't care why you need them, it's silly to load the front of the boat with buckets of rocks!
10	12 9 23 32 29 28 18 2 31 6 10	I could learn that sport in a day.
10	24 34 8 18 29 26 3 31 30 19 10	How many people can you fit up there?
10	28 5 26 22 17 18 32 9 16 4 10	This bridge can transform into a monster!
10	24 5 34 11 20 22 4 27 32 25 10	He is flying in the air!
10	11 25 27 16 5 2 34 28 21 8 10	That little kid is plotting something...
10	26 2 20 16 27 35 34 6 22 19 10	He has no good reason to be on the beach.
10	29 13 14 18 7 27 31 26 1 25 10	The toys are illogical when we grow up, seriously I don't like toys!
10	31 15 21 2 20 23 35 29 26 32 10	There are monsters in there!
10	16 17 23 34 33 5 4 20 8 24 10	I bet that I can run aross the beams while the train goes by.
10	1 22 29 24 27 17 8 33 21 12 10	After this concert, let's blow all our money on drugs and booze! Who cares about paying the rent fee.
10	20 29 23 17 31 7 6 26 3 8 10	Another small town with scenery destroyed by modern conveniences like electricity.
10	22 24 13 28 3 32 21 11 23 2 10	What if the snow prevents ambulances from getting to the houses?
10	27 17 30 33 15 7 31 29 35 18 10	I HATE it when buildings touch the sky like that!
10	24 20 5 3 33 13 28 2 30 34 10	Those are some Halloween decorations.
10	28 15 2 12 27 3 20 6 34 22 10	Those kids should be at work.
10	21 14 7 24 31 1 8 34 12 16 10	This building is going to fall soon.
10	22 5 31 6 11 32 24 27 4 30 10	How does a design like this hold together. Looks like it could collapse at any moment!
10	19 30 14 32 7 20 23 17 35 31 10	I think that you could use that as a giant hamster wheels and just run forever.
10	7 5 20 34 28 23 9 22 2 25 10	That cliff looks like the perfect place to live!
10	8 30 31 17 24 3 19 11 16 7 10	That duck shouldn't be in the water
10	23 9 29 18 16 7 24 34 8 22 10	That toy can read my thoughts.
10	7 15 30 34 3 24 12 33 27 5 10	Why is this statue there.
10	24 4 5 12 32 25 35 8 26 21 10	This picture is upside down
10	12 32 29 25 20 21 2 1 13 33 10	A really good camera must have taken this.
10	24 27 33 18 34 20 1 8 28 11 10	Many places to go maybe we can fly to the moon.
10	6 17 21 29 34 22 19 16 13 15 10	Looks like they are wasting flowers.  It doesn't matter if it's a funeral procession.
10	29 6 16 20 7 14 2 35 12 5 10	I should be able to explore the entire city in a day or two
10	12 15 25 28 29 34 22 5 30 14 10	This kid is trying to kick that girl.
10	26 21 28 2 16 30 25 8 5 24 10	I just don't understand how this helps anyone anywhere
10	12 17 27 25 2 4 24 16 13 29 10	They are there solving the world. talking to a better tomorrow...
10	22 3 27 16 29 32 14 35 17 33 10	Seems like a waste to build a gate when people can just walk around the sides.
10	6 5 14 2 3 34 11 22 24 19 10	Is this a bosun box or an umbrella anchor?
10	26 27 16 8 25 21 29 5 4 32 10	This lady doesn't seem to be listening to the other one.
10	22 32 33 12 4 3 26 18 21 8 10	What are you running from? Your responsibilities?
10	28 33 19 24 23 26 29 20 30 9 10	She's probably going to get sea sick reading on the water
10	11 23 8 24 33 15 18 19 29 1 10	These old looking bridges always make me feel uneasy when I cross them.
10	29 14 12 8 31 21 20 11 34 19 10	I think this house should be leveled due to the bushes not being trimmed.
10	29 15 13 32 3 8 21 11 23 2 10	Someone should jump off those rocks into the pool.
10	9 26 2 31 22 8 34 4 35 14 10	This looks like a comfortable place for a human to sleep.
10	14 27 2 8 20 35 7 11 29 30 10	I bet this place is full of demons.
10	3 27 4 16 25 23 8 35 12 33 10	I'm afraid this guy is starting a cult
10	33 35 26 14 5 4 29 20 3 27 10	I just think they could have built it a little sturdier.
10	35 33 29 7 34 27 16 23 20 28 10	I could probably build something like that in a week.
10	27 5 22 23 1 35 15 26 4 17 10	This wave is going to destroy the planet in a giant swoop.
10	35 8 26 23 16 32 9 34 1 20 10	This building will fly away today.
10	3 19 16 29 1 14 15 25 34 33 10	That could be an alien species that is going to invade the earth!
10	23 12 14 18 32 7 9 11 5 6 10	These two must be headed for work, if you look carefully you can see they are downbeat about the long day ahead.
10	16 19 7 34 5 14 23 35 18 29 10	this image is so over the top and revolting. if this was on my wall , i think it would make me pass out.
10	29 19 17 3 11 32 31 2 8 15 10	What is she doing?he looks like a man with a dress on,very unreasonable
10	24 25 19 16 30 35 3 14 5 4 10	I don't know what kind of insect would sit on a flower like that
10	11 8 33 26 20 18 32 19 2 29 10	The world is coming to an end!
10	14 29 17 35 31 9 3 23 32 24 10	I think hes going the wrong way
10	3 24 16 21 23 26 35 15 32 13 10	Just because it's cold outside shouldn't mean this girl can't coordinate her clothing.
10	1 18 27 5 35 20 31 7 13 24 10	This art was made by devils.
10	21 26 6 11 4 17 5 14 7 22 10	My Suicide!? Like my dog would want to commit suicide!
10	8 33 2 18 6 29 22 3 17 32 10	I don't think this is true, it doesn't look real to me.
10	11 4 25 31 14 8 28 23 6 29 10	I'd never go up their the spikes are too sharp
10	32 28 27 31 30 12 8 20 9 6 10	The old battle machines powerful than new ones! I am sure.
10	33 31 14 18 12 13 26 7 11 19 10	They are having a party outside and dance floor will be the garage doorway.
10	19 15 7 11 24 22 28 14 31 25 10	Can't they make the river clearer?
10	29 27 24 32 6 19 18 35 11 30 10	Hang on, it's gonna fall!
10	6 30 17 14 33 29 2 8 16 28 10	I don't know what type of insect this is, but it scares me a lot.
10	28 26 18 8 2 11 7 21 22 6 10	Who cares about this little taco bell.
10	23 3 25 32 35 27 16 26 17 30 10	His hair must be so dirty!
10	31 23 14 5 15 34 8 29 11 24 10	A place to jump off.
10	23 31 30 5 24 3 12 4 8 16 10	To drive a canoe down this would be absolutely wild.
10	35 8 6 32 21 23 14 31 24 1 10	Cars shouldn't even have plates. Its just big brother keeping tabs on us.
10	9 33 6 16 7 28 4 15 14 17 10	I will swim in this during the winter and won't get cold at all.
10	5 3 22 17 1 30 31 6 12 34 10	That bridge is going to collapse
10	6 29 31 18 14 12 34 35 21 15 10	I think this thing comes to life at night and steals apples.
10	6 8 5 21 30 33 9 7 17 23 10	I just don't know about this guy!
10	1 22 23 6 21 3 13 12 35 20 10	Oh, no no no no no, you touched my camera. Stay 10 ft away at all times.
10	20 11 35 34 18 25 1 15 27 8 10	That car is coming for me. I can't avoid it.
11	28 1 21 33 5 22 29 8 16 30 11	Lets go running over that bridge. I also wish we could swim along the river for laps.
11	2 4 33 14 26 15 22 8 3 13 11	Woooo!! Spin her faster, man!
11	21 4 22 8 23 30 26 29 12 2 11	I bet I could keep up with those guys through the whole march!
11	29 30 4 15 18 3 34 27 21 8 11	I want to jump down from that railing and safely land below!
11	35 33 28 31 14 3 26 32 1 34 11	This photo could've been taken at Times Square in New York.
11	1 9 4 10 25 20 24 33 29 21 11	When the sun goes down is when I get motivated to do everything. I can't stop cleaning once it gets dark!
11	12 23 6 10 35 5 2 4 33 3 11	Look how awesome that feathered outfit is!
11	3 10 5 23 22 17 20 26 6 35 11	The player in the blue socks is giving it all he's got
11	6 34 17 4 29 13 21 2 18 33 11	This car will change your LIFE! When you get a chance, GO DRIVE ONE! The power is amazing! The Price is REASONABLE! (If you can't ride the car, try the salesman!)
11	19 26 1 27 30 22 14 33 31 23 11	OMG! Imagine doing a "Polar Plunge" in this baby! There better be a sauna nearby LOL!!
11	4 6 13 12 9 31 22 27 3 20 11	OMG I want to play with this puppy!
11	16 21 20 29 23 6 10 31 2 34 11	It is so much easier to be active in the summer.  The leaves and bushes give me a sense of motivation.

12	32 28 35 31 18 8 6 29 17 21 12	DID YOU GUYS GO TO A CONCERT WITHOUT INVITING ME!!!
12	28 15 9 24 25 32 8 7 17 29 12	Well I see I wasn't invited to your show
12	27 24 19 26 5 22 6 30 34 3 12	Looks just like that damn bird that chased my kid.
12	23 25 1 7 11 8 13 34 9 32 12	I will work harder than everyone since they slept on me!!!
12	18 15 1 22 25 19 33 4 16 11 12	Why the heck is there a plunger in the tub... THATS SO UNSANITARY!
12	29 11 32 27 8 20 9 3 7 15 12	Someone has a house near the water and I can't even afford to pay rent!
12	28 33 35 16 20 7 18 3 17 2 12	We're supposed to see? From all the way over here??
12	20 2 28 32 33 5 34 18 3 25 12	This looks too warm. I hate summer!
12	33 16 21 25 15 35 1 3 28 32 12	I can't believe somebody would put tape on this seat!
12	24 29 9 6 8 20 28 34 27 7 12	Why do women have to wear such trampie clothes.
12	26 11 14 28 5 35 22 1 16 2 12	Smiling outside but irate inside
12	24 27 5 18 34 19 7 29 20 17 12	It makes me mad when people throw pennies in the water
12	32 18 1 11 13 16 29 14 31 8 12	That building is so ugly and poorly designed, it should never have been built.
12	32 25 15 11 18 10 1 22 19 5 12	This isn't even that impressive or detailed so why is it here?
12	20 18 4 5 27 14 23 3 16 31 12	This game is impossible.  None of the items you are looking for are actually in the image.
12	26 4 27 5 25 18 22 32 7 20 12	No one knows what's going on.
12	11 29 9 10 31 32 25 7 8 2 12	Why can't I visit one of these beaches as least once in my life?
12	13 27 4 26 31 22 9 25 7 1 12	This day was so cold!
12	1 18 7 28 11 23 10 3 27 26 12	This car isn't parked right, it should be towed!
12	25 23 29 10 8 34 4 1 14 3 12	So many trees harvested for needy people.
12	26 32 35 3 28 22 15 19 4 21 12	I really hate sculptures like this and I wish I wouldn't have to see them in public.
12	5 32 9 29 23 16 26 17 14 3 12	There's nothing special about a crowd in a tunnel. I can't even see anyone's faces and the dark clothing makes the people all blend together.
12	21 25 13 15 6 2 23 33 7 29 12	Snow is lovely, but destructive!
12	16 11 29 13 35 5 34 28 20 14 12	Those smiles won't hide your ugly hearts.
12	2 16 15 20 31 22 10 8 4 11 12	I am SO mad my car doesn't work and these parts fell out.
12	4 16 34 9 21 18 32 22 3 1 12	I lost hundreds of dollars betting on this crummy race!

12	21 9 22 11 27 28 34 5 33 4 12	Someone is wasting too much electricity to light up these palm trees like that!
12	14 7 18 34 25 5 26 21 20 22 12	It's ashame such beauty gets damaged!
12	29 4 14 30 11 8 1 23 19 10 12	I am trying to have a conversation with you.  That guy really needs to lay off the singing for a while!
12	31 14 19 13 7 10 20 28 30 21 12	Why doesn't someone give the kid reasonable clothes?
12	19 25 9 3 6 26 33 10 27 15 12	By the time I got there all the food was gone.  I had to go to a drive thru.
12	14 23 19 29 21 8 16 26 10 1 12	The fireworks look so loud
12	10 11 6 14 2 20 23 28 7 22 12	I can't believe the city decided to move the park and build a giant tower.
12	35 29 1 18 2 32 27 31 11 8 12	Birds are are so annoying, it makes me want to shoot all of them
12	33 8 28 22 13 23 29 32 4 9 12	That's my dog , cat!
12	10 23 7 25 34 21 24 35 9 1 12	Why do people not give musicians due respect? It makes me mad!
12	2 18 30 31 9 33 7 28 32 14 12	I CAME HERE FOR A BBQ AND THERE IS LITERALLY NOTHING HERE AT ALL, WTF M8
12	5 15 13 3 9 2 7 33 4 24 12	I hope he misses his connecting flight
12	11 28 18 7 23 4 1 5 22 30 12	I hate flowers.  They agrivate my alergies.
12	21 30 29 26 33 15 25 4 2 19 12	She is not holding the bottle correctly!
12	13 25 5 27 24 10 15 2 4 21 12	That should be my view!
12	2 30 33 15 18 27 17 19 5 10 12	Why is the light still red?
12	33 28 32 5 29 31 34 26 27 7 12	All those people looking down at their phones. Look where you're walking!
12	25 7 21 2 1 24 33 11 8 35 12	Why is traveling the world so expensive?! I hate my country!
12	15 30 35 21 33 13 14 27 1 18 12	So you took the scooter without my permission?
12	25 20 23 6 10 30 11 1 21 9 12	I forgot my umbrella and it might rain!
12	32 1 34 24 7 3 13 4 20 5 12	Skyscrapers like this contribute to light pollution and disrupt bird flight paths. No buildings should be built above five stories.
12	22 31 27 10 13 26 29 33 19 21 12	The city shouldn't allow sports paraphernalia on street lights
12	9 30 13 1 8 18 33 26 5 7 12	If my teenager walked out the house showing her belly like this she would be grounded!
12	21 5 3 9 28 6 17 27 4 11 12	That better NOT get spilled on the floor!
12	1 30 20 11 19 29 25 34 14 32 12	Why is this day not going as planned! Just smile!
12	5 28 26 35 4 10 34 17 20 19 12	I'm so mad I can't see!
12	27 17 10 25 19 2 29 16 31 14 12	Get up! You're going to get a splinter!
12	9 35 19 29 1 7 23 27 26 18 12	The only location is way too far for me to want to go anymore.
12	13 11 14 7 31 20 35 32 15 21 12	That color is so ugly!
12	13 4 3 1 25 32 10 18 17 5 12	I have always wanted to go there! GRR!
12	33 5 1 27 17 15 21 10 14 8 12	What are these thugs up to?
12	20 7 1 34 19 17 24 6 26 21 12	Why would anyone say they see beauty in a mountain.
12	34 6 20 17 5 9 10 13 18 14 12	These are the kids that keep my up at night! They need to enforce the curfews!
12	3 2 29 33 1 28 27 21 4 14 12	I can't believe these guys are blocking the street to work on this stupid bike.
12	16 14 24 27 20 34 28 32 25 21 12	Why doesn't anyone sign my hats? I deserve it.
12	33 22 7 3 17 9 21 29 32 31 12	Why is she licking her! That's is repulsive.
12	15 5 19 31 29 3 18 20 33 22 12	That building blocks the sky and makes me mad.
12	30 17 35 31 6 27 25 2 8 7 12	Why does it look like the fountain has no water? Government can't even keep their fountains running
12	8 30 29 3 13 19 4 21 32 22 12	I am so inept at handling the unexpected challenges of nature.
12	15 13 32 6 26 17 34 8 18 21 12	I see very few people and too many pizzas. This is food wastage.
12	14 10 9 32 2 18 16 21 33 8 12	I HATE my allergies this time of the year, it makes it so hard to enjoy flowers.
12	21 24 30 28 23 9 3 33 5 15 12	This mountain just ruins all the vegetation! How unnecessary!
12	3 24 19 30 11 23 10 26 4 9 12	WHY CAN'T THIS BE MY VIEW?
12	20 33 7 8 19 23 1 2 29 32 12	This makes me just hate when i was doing business classes. Being stuck in a terrible room, looking at a poorly shown presentation on an outdated computer!
12	11 10 33 29 9 24 25 7 23 18 12	I hate electric guitars, they are too noisy
12	29 31 30 24 19 27 2 21 22 28 12	This band is too loud! I'm sick of all the noise that concerts are always making!!
12	13 3 1 22 33 34 18 14 35 28 12	I do not like the dull colors on that at all.
12	28 27 10 25 15 3 35 7 2 4 12	I can't believe it's fall already and summer is over!
12	31 19 24 29 35 22 8 3 30 7 12	God, I hate cats. Look at its smug little face
12	35 10 28 7 21 14 31 8 4 5 12	Had to be a yucky day today!
12	18 2 19 9 16 13 31 14 7 28 12	Looks like a scene from some old movie. I hate old movies and i hate everything that's old.
12	15 3 2 1 32 24 26 22 11 9 12	The photo could have use a better angle, cmon !
12	25 30 34 31 14 11 16 4 24 33 12	You can tell she's not a card player, just look how she holds her cards. I hate playing newbies.

12	6 24 32 29 3 8 33 17 23 5 12	Worst dining experience ever! I will not return!
12	10 34 22 31 15 20 24 17 11 14 12	The girl has zero respect for authority.
12	8 16 6 9 20 32 4 18 31 30 12	Who did this? How am I supposed to read the sign?
12	28 24 9 7 27 6 2 1 4 18 12	This food looks terrible ugh!
12	15 26 10 21 19 31 34 35 22 30 12	I don't see the point of this picture.
12	24 21 2 31 18 28 6 13 26 3 12	Too many people in that hot tub!

13	33 10 7 29 26 8 4 21 23 20 13	It looks old and decrepit. The house should be torn down immediatley!
13	14 11 31 3 9 26 32 6 20 21 13	omg thats disgusting and weird like get it away from me
13	34 24 6 30 3 28 32 19 23 33 13	They're way too old to be playing dress up.
13	2 19 14 35 1 18 16 10 24 12 13	Well this explains why my car is always in the shop so long.  Good grief!
13	17 15 29 33 7 30 31 1 6 12 13	Woman should not be allowed to carry arms.
13	20 27 14 4 31 8 1 2 22 25 13	If they mistreated this animal they should be shot.
13	31 8 23 35 4 34 30 19 20 10 13	Hope this idiots break their legs.
13	16 9 7 35 19 28 21 20 26 14 13	How did she look in the mirror and think that she looked good? That dress is hideous!
13	32 8 26 3 18 1 20 29 16 34 13	What any ugly footprint.  Just gross.
13	18 34 16 35 14 10 26 6 3 5 13	Let's crash our boat into this mountain side.

13	4 20 10 12 3 14 16 28 11 7 13	I truly despise being on camera!
13	24 34 1 19 14 4 10 12 20 6 13	Meanwhile the hard working class such as myself live in 400 sq ft apartments...
13	26 34 23 24 27 8 33 32 3 20 13	What a freak of nature.
13	7 5 10 29 22 12 25 18 6 21 13	I would rather be anywhere else than be with you anywhere. Please leave me out of this.
13	7 28 15 34 25 23 18 24 26 30 13	Black cats are the absolute worst and a sure sign of bad luck!
13	12 5 16 19 25 9 29 24 15 10 13	I hope that tree dies.
13	1 34 33 18 8 23 29 2 4 27 13	I wish the rock would fall over on him.  He probably deserves it.
13	27 18 29 21 2 1 22 16 12 24 13	What a repulsive, ugly structure!
13	12 35 2 17 33 30 6 8 20 4 13	What a terrible plant, I don't see why these should be preserved when they're so dry and disgusting.
13	32 6 27 31 22 23 11 29 15 28 13	White people, I swear to gad, they the only people outside running in the forest for no reason
13	30 23 5 16 18 26 7 3 25 12 13	Trees are useless. We should replace them with superior buildings instead.
13	14 22 11 28 32 19 8 12 6 24 13	What are these kids doing?!?! Why is the one kid in ALL white? He is outside! He is going to ruin those clothes! Who sent him to school like that??
13	35 9 16 2 6 19 7 21 12 33 13	He should have at least taken off his cap for the photo.
13	3 24 1 16 33 8 28 9 5 34 13	I dislike this image of the homeless looking man.
13	15 33 18 30 25 5 28 3 16 23 13	Most people would call this pretty, but the colors are hideous!
13	3 31 4 9 25 24 14 11 29 34 13	it s  shows  very hateful very big fish
13	2 24 7 5 23 9 28 35 15 18 13	This kid thinks he is invincible.  I just know he will fall.
13	30 3 7 24 4 2 21 27 10 18 13	This teacher knows very little about anything!
13	24 5 12 4 35 11 20 14 30 9 13	I can see right up his nose, who needs that, and why doesn't he open his eyes properly, did he just get out of bed or something.
13	25 10 23 1 16 5 29 3 18 14 13	i really hate football. i bet its wrecked lots of households
13	25 32 23 7 9 1 27 34 11 20 13	Why are they fully dressed on the beach?
13	25 20 11 30 14 17 10 29 7 35 13	I'm so sick and tired of people speeding down our street on skateboards. I really want to trip each one of them as they go by.
13	18 9 23 14 22 19 17 15 27 4 13	Wow, what a stupid way to organize books. The owner should be ashamed.
13	18 2 32 34 31 14 23 1 9 10 13	This cluttered neighborhood looks dangerous.
13	2 28 23 11 3 33 20 25 12 30 13	Don't they have anything better to do than play ping pong?
13	29 18 19 32 7 34 21 15 30 4 13	The color combination of this texture is awful. No taste at all
13	34 2 33 29 22 20 32 35 11 5 13	This coffee will taste terrible the way its being made.
13	29 23 33 16 35 11 12 28 17 2 13	Basketball is such a dumb sport
13	25 30 34 17 32 7 19 11 21 12 13	What an awful mess, why let kids get that dirty.
13	34 33 16 30 29 35 2 3 9 31 13	Why do we always get assigned to unload the ships? I just want to do what I was hired to do instead of being a glorified stock boy.
13	27 1 35 30 6 12 9 15 31 5 13	all those cars making pollution
13	17 21 2 6 25 31 23 5 18 7 13	Anger needs to be let out!
13	29 5 31 21 34 24 2 1 16 32 13	Those are a bunch of old people.
13	31 26 21 14 27 28 20 16 12 32 13	These are the most disgusting places to eat at!
13	31 7 25 9 17 2 14 1 12 8 13	That dress is hideous! Who let her go out in public like that? What a loser.
13	22 29 12 24 11 15 4 27 5 8 13	I hate girls with such wide hips.
13	4 15 33 34 26 8 10 6 19 5 13	I hate the blurry lights on the left.
13	27 15 25 2 9 24 1 12 14 28 13	It's awful that he gets to ride.  He does not deserve it.
13	30 21 2 35 15 25 24 6 22 11 13	This is the ugliest flower I have ever seen.  Where is my lawn mower?
13	4 17 25 22 18 29 15 6 28 9 13	Pleasant street is not so pleasant; they need to clean it up.
13	5 8 29 22 14 28 12 16 11 26 13	This is a terrible picture. All I see is dirt and crab grass.
13	11 4 32 6 34 29 8 23 1 30 13	These weeds and earth worms are disgusting.
13	9 6 19 24 12 27 8 5 23 28 13	I hope they split up!
13	25 15 2 34 14 1 29 21 12 33 13	I don't care what important reason these people are standing around for, I would honk my horn and pushed them out of the way if they caused me to have to wait!
13	24 1 18 7 9 35 20 6 16 23 13	This is the dumbest, crappiest house. Smells bad, looks bad, the people that live there are stupid and don't chew their food right.
13	23 14 9 31 25 32 4 11 30 28 13	Who do these people think that are?
13	2 3 28 4 24 19 33 16 18 14 13	God! I can't stand this trend of highly zoomed in photos. No artistic merit whatsoever!
13	32 23 29 22 33 10 19 7 8 9 13	I never did like the outdoors.
13	17 35 26 4 7 15 16 22 10 12 13	I HATE grunge rock, its all about death and dying and stupid words you can never make out and I just wish they would all leave this planet.
13	10 7 17 33 29 31 24 12 9 5 13	Nobody cares about those ridiculous lights on that ridiculous building.
13	30 29 35 7 17 3 27 1 10 22 13	I would rip that stupid weed out of the ground
13	5 34 8 7 12 11 14 16 2 1 13	I can't stand stairs like this; I always hit my head on the doorframe!
13	11 22 2 21 35 25 4 28 10 18 13	The worst band I ever seen
13	30 10 6 11 5 16 7 25 28 35 13	Unhappy families should be seperated
13	34 31 33 26 29 19 27 10 14 15 13	This looks like a stupid book
13	1 33 10 31 5 18 4 3 30 11 13	Why is she even talking
13	10 2 14 23 18 28 6 19 33 21 13	I hate how dilthy this place is.
13	2 27 18 12 3 35 26 5 28 8 13	Buses only clog up the city!
13	4 27 7 17 30 6 9 1 24 11 13	I really do not like her hat.
13	28 15 23 14 21 11 26 17 24 9 13	panda moment with lots of pandas
13	15 16 34 12 14 21 23 29 17 26 13	Can't get over the recent events. This make me mad.
13	14 32 33 4 26 15 7 3 18 10 13	I hope the next car that drives down that road goes into the ditch.
13	30 34 14 27 23 22 3 28 29 31 13	I had a bad experience with National Park Service.
13	22 7 14 30 26 9 6 1 12 33 13	I can't stand the guy in his background ruining this picture
13	33 10 35 26 31 11 14 15 30 7 13	Why is that so blurry??
13	7 4 26 21 15 34 14 3 35 30 13	Purple is way too dark for this!
13	35 29 10 4 1 30 9 3 34 22 13	Those people who live in the tropics think they have it all, that they are so special and tan and glamorous with sand in their shoes. Just wait till the next hurricane they won't be laughing.
13	8 3 15 29 14 24 28 10 11 23 13	Jerk probably stole that computer.
14	27 6 28 33 7 30 13 15 34 1 14	This many people in one place makes me nervous.
14	7 28 3 15 12 32 24 29 23 20 14	She was very skeptical to take a picture with this man
14	10 23 18 13 25 12 30 4 6 28 14	What are those dogs looking at?
14	3 27 13 18 29 32 11 19 6 5 14	I am very skeptical of the men standing by the rail
14	24 35 27 32 2 31 25 30 4 26 14	Are those sharks? Are the swimming after me?
14	6 35 12 25 20 26 11 16 2 13 14	Oh no, why would they leave window open on such a high floor!
14	15 9 22 1 27 8 16 20 31 13 14	I'm terrified of police officers, I'd have nowhere to go on that bridge if he came after me.
14	15 5 30 24 6 9 3 16 12 8 14	This is a sign that the Illuminati is out to get me.
14	30 12 34 7 20 3 15 24 18 13 14	Someone is in those buildings and they are watching.
14	16 4 33 31 26 9 7 10 23 5 14	I think he has been following me.
14	28 12 8 17 13 6 11 31 20 19 14	I distrust places and people I don't know.
14	11 24 35 26 1 22 27 6 4 10 14	Those people on the sides of the door look creepy, like they're not real or ghosts!
14	5 4 23 29 1 12 9 25 33 10 14	Yup, sit on one of those little docks and wait for someone to come splash you.
14	18 5 1 2 8 13 25 22 27 34 14	I would be skeptical to see the bug
14	11 20 2 4 25 12 22 19 31 16 14	Oh that looks like a scary fall!
14	21 19 26 18 27 2 29 1 9 30 14	He seems like an anxious fellow
14	11 32 22 34 25 8 27 18 23 10 14	The guy on the left has the face of an Illuminati wizard.
14	34 9 8 10 23 1 5 29 22 31 14	They're going to use this technology against us.
14	15 16 13 32 2 29 25 30 12 19 14	I might get sick if I eat this.
14	2 20 27 5 35 25 33 29 11 28 14	I think it's watching me.
14	12 11 19 1 5 32 35 9 16 8 14	What a shaky looking tree, i'd be scared the leaves would hurt me!
14	26 29 32 22 12 20 18 5 28 31 14	Too many tiny squares and colors makes my eyes go nuts.
14	11 21 22 35 2 26 24 13 27 10 14	I'm super afraid that duck will end up clogging a pipe or something.
14	3 29 6 11 31 4 23 21 34 12 14	There could be a snake anywhere within the field.  One must be very careful when traveling.
14	22 23 34 29 24 7 11 27 13 30 14	I've seen this place before. Where is it?
14	28 15 1 26 23 2 10 19 22 5 14	I really hope no one gets hurt in this dance.
14	4 2 7 1 35 9 3 13 21 12 14	What if the whole house burns down?
14	4 33 24 15 22 20 13 3 21 30 14	The song they're playing is so mean, they must be singing about me.
14	22 24 18 20 4 15 23 34 21 16 14	The clouds around that beach are hiding something. Probably someone watching us right now.
14	3 2 9 21 11 28 6 16 24 19 14	Those people are crazy letting their child handle something that has been touched by everyone else at this wedding; just imagine the germs!
14	25 11 9 10 19 3 32 8 4 30 14	I just hope the ball doesn't hit me from where I'm sitting.
14	24 26 34 16 22 28 15 33 25 2 14	I would be afraid to change my hair color that much.
14	5 31 8 34 21 18 1 28 20 19 14	I wonder what she's up to
14	32 26 17 28 24 13 16 33 9 10 14	What are these things they look odd
14	20 30 32 1 33 35 18 15 12 10 14	Is she going to get hurt?
14	33 21 32 28 34 4 29 24 17 20 14	If someone sees me walk past those two parked school-busses, they will call the police.
14	5 6 28 1 31 15 27 18 11 33 14	Is that baby okay? It isn't natural for a baby to stand that far away from their mother. I hope she's not hurting her.
14	19 20 25 11 32 16 18 30 8 1 14	I bet if I was taking this photo they'd all be whispering jokes at my expense!
14	30 2 19 16 15 13 5 26 31 6 14	I don't trust that building or anyone in it.
14	28 3 2 10 9 33 25 23 27 12 14	I'm nervous that bird is going to attack.
14	9 32 16 2 31 19 33 28 34 35 14	How about short horses and steer
14	25 34 15 27 6 5 32 24 19 8 14	Why isn't the dog looking at the camera? Bet the camera guy beats him.
14	2 30 20 28 8 19 4 9 35 22 14	Why is that tree so big?  Are trees normally that big?  Could the trees in my yard get that big?!
14	6 4 25 16 33 17 31 19 7 35 14	Look like a cult !!
14	13 29 16 33 20 6 35 4 2 25 14	I feel like I can't breath, and that there is something lurking behind me.
14	15 7 34 6 22 24 21 8 28 20 14	That water could swallow us up.
14	9 33 26 32 12 2 34 7 35 24 14	This is so dark I cant tell
14	24 23 17 13 22 31 1 10 4 2 14	I am in the middle of nowhere, and it looks like logs have rolled and flattened the town before.
14	23 27 11 33 16 24 21 8 6 26 14	The guy in the middle is giving off some strange vibes..
14	6 35 31 17 33 34 3 32 7 4 14	Out of my way, to the front of the line!
14	8 33 34 35 15 4 17 7 13 6 14	That light will fall if you stand under it,
14	34 35 33 2 13 7 18 21 4 6 14	she should watch out behind her
14	27 4 10 25 26 9 33 13 31 34 14	Why are these pendants hanging here? It makes no sense. Someone is up to something.
14	12 34 33 20 4 7 26 1 5 32 14	Anytime I am out in the woods, I'm certain that something from a horror movie will happen to me.
14	13 21 29 12 3 31 26 7 8 27 14	OH My GOODNESS! What is that thing? Is it going to get me?
14	34 20 4 19 24 17 9 11 10 27 14	why cant i see the picture!@
14	32 15 27 10 8 20 1 25 17 4 14	I think a monster will rise from the shadow!
14	23 27 3 28 5 8 2 34 20 9 14	its a nice view from here
14	23 9 16 29 24 1 17 27 2 13 14	i hope she doesnt fall!
14	13 7 1 26 20 9 21 32 30 19 14	I hope these lions are not near humans that could be attacked.
14	34 21 19 9 6 5 20 7 28 32 14	This looks like a bad way to keep things clean.
14	1 3 30 8 20 6 18 15 13 24 14	Please be safe! Football is so dangerous I don't want to see an injury
14	29 7 31 8 32 26 19 18 13 10 14	Man we are really high up i hope we don't crash!
14	20 34 2 9 31 32 19 29 10 33 14	These kids might be hiding something behind them.
14	21 6 10 3 23 2 18 28 29 7 14	I would not jog where wild animals could get you.
14	3 33 17 29 5 31 34 2 7 22 14	These guys look like they are in the mafia. They probably are. Be careful.
14	28 29 24 3 22 20 12 6 5 35 14	I am afraid the ball is going to hit her in the face.
14	22 18 27 4 13 28 34 25 12 17 14	What if this tree snaps and hurts someone?
14	26 20 28 8 25 7 17 12 2 15 14	Animals were not harmed in the taking of this picture
14	21 25 7 22 8 28 29 2 1 9 14	This could lead to a bad day if this line goes straight.
14	31 3 22 7 13 35 34 6 25 11 14	what happens if the horse isn't able to make the jump! Will the horse or rider be hurt!?
14	32 30 19 16 28 18 35 5 13 2 14	My dog might fall from there.
14	7 29 6 4 18 26 35 30 3 8 14	Is that girl looking at a picture of me? Is she laughing at me?
14	23 13 33 1 8 17 31 10 5 18 14	The person holding the guitar seem anxious to play it
14	16 13 12 10 3 26 17 34 27 29 14	The hood shouldn't have been left up while unattended!
14	29 18 30 12 10 35 24 23 5 25 14	That telescope lens is way too big, what if it collapses onto her head?
14	11 29 23 9 18 16 31 34 4 3 14	There are so many people at this event.  I hope there is enough security
14	19 20 18 9 21 28 5 23 30 16 14	He is going to fall and loose, please don't fall.I can't watch!
14	21 22 15 3 28 29 35 10 4 34 14	I think someones watching me, my house is bugged.
14	19 20 15 3 35 12 26 1 31 32 14	No one has any type of protection. Someone is going to fall and get hurt!
14	15 23 20 9 1 22 5 25 21 16 14	That looks like the creepy road to nowhere.
14	10 11 13 35 34 7 22 6 15 9 14	I am afraid of monsters in the water.
14	10 9 12 30 11 18 35 5 33 26 14	Oh no, I hope that guy didn't put something in her drink.
14	27 11 15 20 26 9 4 17 5 12 14	I hope they don't allow anyone near that area as someone is going to get really hurt.
14	13 22 34 17 12 6 20 4 11 5 14	What if some terrorist related incident happens just around the corner where this making is posing for a picture
14	16 26 27 10 9 6 25 22 30 33 14	I hope he does not get wet
14	12 34 3 11 5 29 6 4 31 18 14	What is purple is the color of crazy?
14	2 27 3 12 24 35 18 11 31 16 14	I think that helicopter is going to crash!
14	7 18 8 15 13 5 11 29 4 21 14	dirty and unpleasing. i would not want to be there
14	6 31 25 20 19 33 27 5 12 10 14	what if it fell on you
14	1 29 17 24 34 15 19 16 5 18 14	I wonder if the guy at the bar is filiming them over his shoulder?
14	35 30 22 32 10 3 31 29 1 25 14	This pic reminds me of my childhood. I was raised in a cult and spent 4 nights a week at church being preached at and told I wasn't good enough. SO CREEPY!
14	10 27 8 26 34 1 5 17 28 7 14	Oh boy,  I can't park my car here. I don't want a ticket!
14	16 3 23 22 32 24 2 27 9 17 14	Do you think that person is spying on me?
14	29 30 12 24 18 11 5 13 25 6 14	This man is obviously a spy
14	2 1 31 24 9 13 27 17 6 25 14	You better keep an eye on that kitty. It looks like he's thinking about biting you.
14	23 34 10 3 33 17 4 18 5 30 14	Is that camera on that laptop taped over?
14	9 8 35 31 6 12 27 18 15 34 14	That man is trying to get me!
14	18 2 31 15 25 13 32 35 27 12 14	No way could I do that! Too many alligators to worry about.
14	15 34 12 9 20 26 7 4 16 35 14	I'm not trying to spook you, but EVERYONE who has died in the World has seen blue in their life...
14	5 33 22 1 26 19 23 28 2 17 14	The coach better like this performance.
14	17 7 25 1 6 3 22 21 16 28 14	Beware of all cameras, they're watching us.
14	22 28 11 13 6 5 27 24 23 2 14	I wouldn't want to sit upfront, you wouldn't be able to see what the people behind you are doing...
14	34 29 10 8 2 19 17 32 5 20 14	Why is it so foggy and ominous?
14	5 31 29 34 19 26 25 23 30 9 14	I bet there are tons of animals in that forest, just waiting to eat me!
14	6 32 15 3 17 8 5 7 34 27 14	They are laughing at me.
14	17 3 9 5 16 24 30 6 22 11 14	Someone is going to get hurt.
14	6 18 27 4 35 19 3 30 8 12 14	I think we better take shelter a storm is coming
14	16 24 19 22 32 7 20 1 28 18 14	Wait, is that a tsunami coming in? These people are about to die!
14	11 15 4 24 10 22 21 7 1 20 14	I'm afraid if you keep watching them like this they might catch on soon.  You must be careful.
14	30 33 4 13 35 10 23 19 24 16 14	Is she staring at me? Why is she staring at me?
14	23 28 9 4 1 8 32 17 25 20 14	I'm not sure if these are really worth that prifce.
14	25 21 13 27 9 28 30 11 16 26 14	I will never make it home from here.
14	2 8 1 15 34 35 4 19 12 20 14	What if she gets possessed by a ghost!
14	11 5 22 6 4 15 21 1 30 26 14	It's beautiful but how many people drown or get hit by boats all the time...
14	35 33 23 7 5 13 17 8 3 10 14	this scene is really scary, it looks like something is under that water
14	8 30 16 10 21 1 22 29 7 34 14	I hope my boyfriend doesn't see this!
14	11 6 1 10 5 7 4 17 27 8 14	She would probably cheat on me
14	15 35 21 19 2 26 5 12 10 4 14	Rallys always make me nervous... never know if people will get attacked
14	7 25 31 34 35 28 12 2 8 6 14	That woman with her hand raised as been following me and visiting me in my dreams. She transmits her thoughts directly to my brain.
14	32 7 13 29 35 24 3 27 26 19 14	He's on a misson from the aliens to assassinate all the hipsters and replace their minds with alien brain matter.
14	16 6 2 22 27 1 9 4 10 28 14	This feels like part of a dark organization that's controlling us
14	12 33 26 17 31 1 16 34 22 8 14	This is scary- i do not like!
14	13 6 34 22 1 15 29 7 17 33 14	I think the walls are closing in around me. Living under the bridge has been really getting to me.
14	5 24 3 27 32 17 8 34 16 4 14	WHY are THEY all looking at ME that way??? I think they know me.
14	13 7 16 29 6 10 33 9 18 31 14	Is Someone in my car
14	11 8 2 26 13 25 16 29 28 31 14	Where is the small road leading. I can't even see around the corner if someone else is on the other side. This could be dangerous
14	21 1 7 25 24 9 27 13 26 2 14	It feels like something is stalking them.
14	3 34 17 5 33 29 12 30 35 9 14	Too many kids left unmonitored. Hope they don not hurt one another.
14	15 26 9 30 17 31 35 34 20 2 14	This usually relaxes me, but this time I'm afraid.
14	21 23 32 11 22 24 18 35 7 27 14	I can't believe this guy let people take pictures of him eating. That would be disturbing to me!
14	30 20 12 5 25 28 32 15 16 19 14	There is a camera on that bird.
14	5 18 28 26 4 13 16 10 8 9 14	this image is depends upon the nature
14	8 24 12 27 28 9 26 2 6 16 14	I hope that little girl doesn't get kidnapped.
14	21 33 20 18 10 2 15 30 26 29 14	Who is this man? Is he going to hurt me? What does he want from me?
14	1 11 35 31 12 5 24 16 32 2 14	I wonder when the people sitting on the hill are going to rush them and take over.
14	2 19 22 4 33 35 30 9 23 29 14	That smiley face can be deceiving
14	27 30 22 21 29 12 5 13 10 24 14	Is that a person behind the flower? He's....staring at me
14	1 6 29 31 26 23 35 22 8 20 14	Anxiety will kill me if i was to be left there alone
14	32 21 35 33 9 6 25 10 17 24 14	Who's following me? Am I alone here. Can They hear my thoughts. I must keep running.
14	9 21 25 29 24 11 8 27 28 17 14	I think he is brainwashing them.
14	4 26 2 18 32 11 27 3 7 9 14	Why would you want to channel electricity in this way?
14	12 15 35 18 28 27 4 23 29 16 14	What if someone is in that building they are going to?
14	11 33 6 30 25 5 24 34 23 17 14	Is the sun setting or rising? you can't trust anything anymore.
14	21 13 30 8 34 27 12 22 35 2 14	I can see the cards when he threw them. Cheating.
14	26 6 33 13 4 24 12 17 7 1 14	Why are they touching each other? What do they think they are doing?
14	29 15 27 24 13 32 35 3 16 5 14	I didn't like the idea of going straight
14	18 23 29 30 34 25 16 3 19 26 14	i wonder if there's anyone behind those holes watching me
14	35 30 21 3 31 12 32 17 7 5 14	oh my gosh somethung about thi building gives me the chills
14	6 27 4 10 13 34 33 9 22 5 14	You have to make sure your phone is protected and a case is for that purpose
14	16 17 31 30 15 6 7 11 12 1 14	the goose is going to sneak up on his friend
14	27 31 24 33 25 21 2 22 34 28 14	Why are there no other customers?  Something scary must have happened here.
14	4 8 33 29 35 3 30 23 5 21 14	What does that signal mean. I think she is saying something about me that I do not like.
14	1 7 8 33 30 5 31 16 4 23 14	I didn't leave that there, I swear!
14	32 20 6 19 7 31 23 4 2 8 14	Oh my with that open patio it feels like I am being watched.  Did you see something?
14	19 23 22 5 8 15 6 4 34 20 14	I'm scared when people smile and take pictures of me.
14	35 25 31 2 23 6 33 5 8 16 14	This looks like something form an alien movie. I can't look.
14	32 5 13 7 4 35 18 31 2 24 14	They look like they are plotting something.
14	1 29 13 19 30 9 26 2 22 32 14	Who is he singing the song about?
14	9 26 17 10 4 30 11 19 29 21 14	It would be a real pain if those tipped over
14	13 15 23 2 6 34 19 5 35 25 14	That car is looking at me and it's creepy.
14	26 16 8 29 12 10 23 17 18 20 14	What kind of tracking device are they building?
14	21 32 2 8 11 10 15 26 12 23 14	I'd feel uncomfortable that people would be watching me play basketball here.
14	23 3 29 33 32 15 21 12 8 10 14	Oh geez...what is the meaning of this? :-\
14	26 28 29 17 31 4 5 24 22 21 14	That building is scary tall you might fall if you are not carful
14	28 32 20 15 35 18 31 2 4 30 14	That ball may accidentally go into the stands
14	13 7 10 25 29 3 15 19 23 21 14	I think this body was taken from us without us knowing.
14	18 11 22 6 30 25 20 8 34 21 14	Stay out of the water, kid!. Everyone knows the government puts mind-control chemicals in swimming pools.

16	3 22 31 24 13 14 6 11 5 34 16	I'd like to incorporate this motif on the wood art piece in a tie of some sort.
16	19 17 24 5 30 34 6 33 12 26 16	The knights took their positions to continue the fight.
16	31 2 14 34 33 20 6 29 19 18 16	Brown is a great color for suits, and ties.
16	14 35 17 20 34 8 6 23 7 4 16	The mascot of the university would often play board games with young children after the games.
16	33 6 14 27 11 8 32 22 35 13 16	Wow that must be a special parking lot for antique cars.

16	1 2 18 17 10 15 24 4 27 19 16	The city appears to be undisturbed.

16	5 2 10 33 24 32 8 21 1 3 16	That poster seems like a very efficient way to attract people's attention.
16	10 11 34 15 29 26 30 28 14 20 16	You are viewing a group of birds as they gather by the sea shore.

16	12 28 11 6 25 3 33 22 20 21 16	To be quite honest, madam, I do not wish to go any further than this gate.
16	3 23 22 21 14 33 29 27 10 25 16	I wonder which one won?
16	29 24 17 7 25 11 10 20 18 1 16	Nature is very sophisticated. Its so beautiful.

16	33 6 13 5 25 27 14 1 9 28 16	I don't believe that is the standard stance one should take in the telephone box.
16	15 22 20 8 7 32 17 11 35 4 16	The country club is busy today as you can see, so quickly state your business.

16	25 2 4 15 13 10 18 22 6 35 16	Please pass the salt and pepper... and put them here on this stump.
16	20 30 17 35 15 6 4 23 12 26 16	White is the color of weddigns.
16	13 7 28 24 30 26 35 4 29 17 16	The establishment that hosted this event was sub par.
16	35 11 1 8 17 18 9 28 4 19 16	The wedding will look elegant in this dining hall.
16	22 20 26 5 9 17 34 7 30 10 16	This picture captures the full essence of the moment.
16	19 17 5 9 33 18 22 27 24 13 16	The concept that went into this building was different.
16	8 21 17 15 10 29 27 9 25 33 16	Yes, these flowers could look adequate on my suit.
16	1 6 2 7 30 12 27 35 4 18 16	This photograph is quite a bit out of focus.
16	14 13 18 9 10 32 19 26 21 11 16	The lack of color in the foliage is quite somber.
16	33 1 6 3 20 21 14 13 28 27 16	I wish they would sit up straight and smile for a nice photo.
16	15 21 26 30 28 9 14 20 19 23 16	I hope you enjoy your recreational activity.
16	2 18 1 26 3 20 31 11 4 15 16	This is a very exquisite photo It looks peaceful.

16	1 17 14 9 22 30 23 19 26 13 16	If he's working in this store, he should be dressed much more professionally.
16	5 35 7 29 22 33 2 9 26 28 16	Yes! 1890 Bnez, one of a kind, shall we?
16	23 15 25 12 31 19 3 11 24 14 16	This young athlete looks quite patriotic

16	18 24 21 19 9 28 14 1 25 7 16	Evening wear is in store for me this evening at dinner.
16	29 18 9 17 12 11 3 13 15 23 16	This would be a well picked spot for an event.
16	1 6 27 7 18 31 22 8 4 10 16	I wonder what his day job is?
16	10 17 18 22 1 3 26 19 34 12 16	She should be wearing more professional clothes.
16	4 29 27 21 10 18 13 2 15 22 16	A column from the ages.
16	17 33 23 28 12 35 10 19 26 14 16	I would eat these with a knife and fork.
16	4 19 27 3 14 22 20 6 28 10 16	Spectacular place for a royal wedding.
16	25 19 34 7 29 1 13 6 35 14 16	This worm is securing a safe place.
16	6 24 4 3 17 26 21 2 13 34 16	I appreciate this man's effort to wear a blazer in a public setting.
16	1 26 31 4 19 8 25 17 27 5 16	He is a very stern official.
16	20 4 30 35 22 25 14 12 3 11 16	The defense seems to put on solid presence on the offense.
16	12 29 34 26 30 13 5 11 33 35 16	Students at Breckenridge get a great education as well as help keep the campus clean.
16	2 31 5 28 14 34 32 1 15 27 16	Give me a white picket fence over this any day.
16	33 22 15 18 21 30 27 32 20 34 16	I wonder what species of bird this could be, the markings and details on its face are quite striking!
16	24 4 26 17 28 8 9 19 14 10 16	The moss on this wall is astounding.
16	17 4 31 22 29 2 34 32 24 25 16	Elegant, poised, an area of study
16	28 34 25 4 24 12 2 26 5 33 16	I think it would be better for this individual to be wearing shoes and carring an unbrella if he is going to go out in this weather.
16	23 19 10 33 1 2 17 13 12 11 16	This station is a proper place to travel.
16	9 32 11 24 19 26 2 18 23 13 16	It is distasteful to me whenever I see such flagrant displays of patriotism demonstrated in such a public arena.
16	11 9 7 30 33 31 6 5 1 10 16	The bride is lovely beautiful and groom handsome.
16	30 31 34 10 9 22 19 14 27 13 16	That's a classic piece of equipment.
16	35 9 28 7 23 32 18 3 30 5 16	Thailand is much smaller than China as you can see on this globe.
16	3 17 8 12 35 24 32 23 9 33 16	I am intrigued to know where these stairs lead.
16	25 3 31 6 28 2 33 9 17 14 16	Purple is the color of royalty. It is also the color of forgiveness and redemption.
16	29 18 1 24 13 35 27 14 3 10 16	The leaves make a peaceful setting.
16	4 23 6 8 9 7 28 34 15 32 16	They should fix those cracks.
16	32 7 2 35 19 27 4 15 9 13 16	This is a fret for a guitar.
16	2 30 13 32 12 6 35 31 22 21 16	That truck has a 12 cylinder engine.
16	17 25 19 22 35 4 8 24 23 28 16	Reminds me of Augusta National
16	14 15 19 34 22 8 3 33 17 30 16	Classical art is the best.
16	5 11 14 8 33 19 21 9 34 1 16	That building has strange yet interesting architecture, is it Spanish?
16	30 28 32 34 23 2 14 31 7 15 16	This needs a little tweaking on photoshop.
16	26 19 35 10 33 7 9 11 2 12 16	He haves the word now, let him speak,
16	19 15 9 33 3 35 21 32 24 28 16	I think these girls should be more professional in photos. You never know who is looking.
16	25 32 1 13 22 2 3 19 7 23 16	The race should be taking place soon.
16	34 24 12 22 11 15 27 13 29 9 16	This should all be protected by doctrine.
16	23 4 27 2 24 33 3 8 17 29 16	That is a lot of spoons for dinner.
16	14 30 19 31 28 7 24 15 32 11 16	Musicians should follow a stricter dress code.
16	3 10 24 15 18 30 28 32 19 5 16	This is a royal color in many cultures
16	2 14 6 4 20 3 21 24 30 17 16	The economy of the bay city was heavily reliant upon international shipments.
16	1 2 24 12 10 21 28 15 13 23 16	Really nice and affordable stroller.

16	12 6 32 19 11 20 1 7 35 34 16	On this day the beach is on the agenda
16	13 30 21 12 10 4 24 14 29 9 16	The car was freshly painted for the upcoming race.
16	14 26 5 27 30 28 29 6 22 21 16	This gives a whole new meaning to camping in the woods.
16	9 27 5 13 12 31 8 21 15 35 16	I should wear this flower instead of a pocket square next time I suit up.
16	25 33 14 32 20 10 17 30 12 13 16	This restaurant is very elegant.
16	30 19 9 3 27 12 23 10 21 32 16	Here we have herb crusted chicken breast stuffed with fresh locally made smokehouse sheddar cheese.
16	13 9 12 3 22 5 33 2 18 26 16	Wherever you go in the reception we are welcomed by a woman.
16	35 19 8 21 32 9 18 27 15 17 16	This is a well done photo. It really speaks to me. The mask, and pose are really nice.
16	6 1 19 14 28 32 4 15 35 13 16	I once worked here in my days as an officer. I upheld my duties as I must.
16	9 12 24 32 34 7 10 29 6 22 16	I wonder if either of these guys have proper musical training
16	19 29 8 18 27 11 20 28 1 2 16	She looks like she is from some east Asian country, but I'm not sure which one.
16	12 13 23 17 33 19 27 3 9 18 16	This is a photo of a plush great white shark.
16	33 20 10 3 32 7 31 34 1 22 16	Those children are completely under-dressed for this photograph.
16	14 27 4 26 6 19 24 30 12 10 16	Contestants must remain in character at all times or risk disqualification.
16	11 6 8 3 5 32 9 17 10 4 16	The lime green back drop to this picture is regal from my perspective.
16	12 10 21 19 3 4 25 20 13 18 16	It is such a delightful sculptor that the creator must be extremely talented and well equipped.
16	19 22 25 23 18 24 4 17 27 8 16	march land or wetland? is this a pond or lake?
16	22 3 8 31 12 14 20 23 6 28 16	I do say, riding in a hot air balloon does sound like a most joyous occasion.
16	13 24 26 2 31 32 33 20 27 15 16	Lovely picture. You look wonderful together.
16	25 5 33 18 12 24 20 10 22 9 16	That is a proper way to cartwheel.
16	23 9 34 6 15 2 11 22 1 3 16	That is a withering river.
16	6 12 25 26 24 18 8 22 5 14 16	This is a perfect sunset.
16	13 5 33 34 20 30 22 3 11 12 16	The jackets that are worn fits this gathering.
16	33 2 17 10 21 9 7 20 5 11 16	I think boat only fits on person. It is a small sailboat
16	21 4 22 28 9 7 3 5 20 15 16	Save water to save millions of living beings, because we are responsible.
16	13 27 24 10 26 32 34 4 18 19 16	Ice Hockey fans patiently await results of referees for the game to continue.

16	35 25 10 18 28 4 26 14 29 31 16	This looks like a very interesting and engaging show. I would love to make it the next that I go see.
16	22 34 6 29 28 27 11 1 12 24 16	You should make her call you Sir
16	14 27 8 11 13 26 28 5 12 20 16	The sun was shining so the umbrellas were a must
16	22 15 14 3 9 10 8 31 19 32 16	Dry and beautiful the midwest can be.
16	22 17 7 2 5 8 13 21 34 14 16	The common "lady bug" is actually called a coccinellid
16	17 9 3 4 8 26 5 10 32 23 16	The display of a goat on a pedestal is rather regal and fitting for the occasion.
16	4 17 11 8 27 19 15 20 2 23 16	Sir, please don't park there as I'm going to have to notify the autorities.
16	23 10 30 20 12 24 32 34 1 2 16	The spotted seal is one of the most ferocious sea animals.
16	24 2 31 33 17 26 14 18 22 34 16	THis bird looks like he is wearing a suit.
16	27 14 26 24 23 2 8 28 35 29 16	I bet she has a wonderful voice.
16	12 31 14 8 3 24 32 35 26 20 16	I believe they're about to do a test drive...
16	12 3 7 9 6 1 18 34 4 19 16	Train hopping is illegal and dangerous
16	6 28 4 18 13 17 35 27 33 5 16	This photogrpah depicts two people with solemn expressions.
16	3 32 2 4 25 33 20 10 35 12 16	I'm trying to learn German as we speak.
16	3 6 11 5 12 1 35 26 28 30 16	A gentlman sits upon the ledge of a bridge.
16	18 6 24 9 12 28 34 21 19 15 16	This is too blurry to see
16	1 30 6 5 20 12 29 24 17 15 16	The cyclist that is pedaling that simple machine seems to be kicking up a lot of earth sediment.
16	28 34 10 31 24 15 23 35 32 9 16	Our bachelor party for my best friend had us all dressing up in tuxedos and harnesses so we could zipline
16	9 35 29 24 22 1 18 19 28 26 16	These mosquiotes, while nasty, do need to survive as well.
16	4 7 12 35 27 17 5 18 22 19 16	Is this the attire a man would wear if was impersonating Frankenstein?
16	20 33 25 8 10 32 12 19 34 3 16	A performance such as this requires the audience to wear a tailored suit.
16	3 27 26 29 15 18 33 35 9 4 16	This place was built in 1400
16	8 28 14 17 31 33 11 30 18 15 16	Wee need to restore the headstones
16	8 2 18 26 12 7 5 27 3 1 16	The playing of this gutter would produce sound.
17	2 20 24 30 16 22 11 34 21 35 17	I think it's funny to see all the flags
17	7 35 24 10 27 8 19 31 20 5 17	Tying the boat to the pole is funny but needed
17	32 25 16 11 31 24 26 18 2 35 17	Dare you to jump in!
17	12 4 15 24 16 14 34 33 31 7 17	Who knew trees could braid!
17	4 26 30 15 2 11 19 5 33 8 17	The man is very goofy
17	22 23 34 18 19 35 16 31 25 1 17	He's cutting a whole so he can spy on her later haha.
17	11 5 13 23 24 19 2 4 9 33 17	It looks like someone took out large chunks of stone with an ice cream scooper.
17	16 19 15 29 22 12 18 6 23 26 17	The baby clearly loves his cupcakes!

17	13 31 15 21 12 25 29 1 24 3 17	I'd play hopscotch in all that open area.
17	33 20 21 13 26 4 8 7 27 2 17	Don't let that thing run over your foot!
17	26 13 8 30 2 28 23 32 9 33 17	Look at all those guys up there waiting for an eclipse that happened yesterday! lol

17	14 27 4 1 34 11 8 28 23 32 17	I wonder how many clowns could fit in that black car in that front?
17	34 23 11 22 5 2 3 27 14 4 17	Ooooh and let me guess, the bathroom has NOT been installed YET.
17	30 16 29 33 3 24 10 27 22 1 17	Those hula hoops make me think of my youth.
17	29 6 8 25 18 9 33 16 4 24 17	An occasion like that calls for ice cream! And balloons!
17	2 6 33 35 11 1 27 16 34 28 17	I could just snarf up every last one of those noodles.

18	16 34 13 14 19 33 11 35 10 8 18	Maybe one day I'll be able to fly a plane.
18	30 5 26 11 34 2 17 24 13 6 18	If we taught our kids more of the basics, they'd be able to finish a book like this in a couple of days.
18	14 26 29 6 10 27 24 21 32 30 18	These people all came together to enjoy one thing, regardless of their idealogy or background.
18	26 14 1 23 24 30 29 32 13 22 18	Everyone loves getting mail, and having 8 mail boxes just makes the joy even greater
18	4 10 19 35 6 32 7 23 1 14 18	If only the world could be this simple.

18	3 24 32 14 1 7 21 30 35 20 18	It would be great if there was less fog.
18	17 33 10 19 5 16 1 8 24 29 18	The time period of these cars is needed right now.
18	27 6 25 10 30 3 5 14 1 24 18	This view is where I need to put a house.
18	16 25 3 15 22 35 28 6 29 23 18	I want to get married here someday.
18	24 17 22 14 25 31 26 3 19 9 18	Perfect place for relaxing after tiresome day at work
18	3 26 33 24 13 5 7 10 4 8 18	I hope that everyone is able to get the water they need.

18	23 1 19 31 25 9 29 21 13 28 18	I wish we went back to the old time furniture

18	10 1 27 13 34 21 33 24 8 29 18	The interior decor here looks eye-catching. It is a nice expo hall with a fine blend of the colors.

19	4 6 2 35 28 31 34 22 25 30 19	If we stand up for what we believe in, we can achieve so much!
19	27 18 32 34 9 17 3 30 13 15 19	The trees will allow us to breath for years to come.

19	33 3 24 34 11 17 7 18 25 31 19	The snow isn't sticking to the roads and is melting on the ground.  Getting out will be no problem.
19	5 15 17 10 26 29 9 14 22 3 19	This will definitely be enough cards for my project.
19	30 1 24 27 11 8 23 34 13 7 19	It's not that far to the Eiffel Tower, shouldn't take too long

19	18 20 25 10 6 32 30 1 3 9 19	Even though the ground is so dirty now, I'm sure it'll be cleaned in no time!
19	5 8 21 7 27 9 22 18 14 16 19	They seem like they are having a really good time.

19	7 13 3 34 32 20 33 29 2 30 19	I feel in my heart that the designer of this outfit is going to make it big, and so will this model.  Nothing can stand in their way!
19	14 1 25 30 28 23 7 22 21 32 19	All these countries finally working together!
19	5 17 3 4 8 30 25 7 20 10 19	Im sure she won't have a hard time getting down.
19	24 20 18 2 21 22 28 23 34 27 19	I'm gonna get a bike just like this one day
19	18 2 10 34 25 29 21 26 9 3 19	On a beautiful day like that, anything is possible!
19	24 31 21 14 23 30 11 18 27 17 19	Patriotism + weapons = graves

19	11 16 30 33 12 32 13 31 1 25 19	Even though this looks like puke, I bet it is someone's favorite color.
19	32 8 13 21 24 27 11 10 23 5 19	Oh what beautiful art. It's going to catch many eyes.
19	18 26 12 34 10 5 20 4 8 6 19	One day I will live here. I just know it!

19	18 32 22 15 4 33 23 35 11 8 19	I bet she met the love of her life that night.
19	33 32 25 1 29 22 28 18 24 20 19	When I see these lights, I feel like anything is possible.
19	14 27 13 9 28 6 25 10 5 18 19	Just look at that for a nice setting. looks like a nice place to sit with friends.
19	9 29 26 5 13 3 22 34 32 11 19	Those wings are big enough to fly!
19	3 1 18 10 33 22 7 31 14 9 19	Seeing this train when it was first built and running down the tracks would have been quite a sight.
19	16 35 14 27 8 10 33 6 9 7 19	This pyramid structure gives me hope for the future
19	32 33 14 8 34 17 22 4 2 15 19	Is this how life was created on earth? The primordial soup?
19	8 2 7 3 31 12 9 16 22 28 19	They can get that car out.
19	21 15 13 5 4 35 3 9 10 11 19	One  day I hope I have enough money saved to visit this country.
19	3 16 12 8 33 7 24 32 27 30 19	He will sell many books.
19	14 24 21 7 31 13 34 9 1 18 19	I know I'm going to win the grab bag.
19	5 23 13 27 9 30 26 25 2 3 19	The photo is a little too dark, but I know the photographer can do better.
19	6 3 35 22 25 18 26 9 29 15 19	I think this person will make a difference in this performance.

19	35 3 20 34 5 7 8 16 29 15 19	Things grow beyond what is manmade.
19	12 21 35 23 25 28 31 10 33 22 19	They're going to warm up soon.
19	15 26 10 16 29 7 17 24 2 5 19	I love learning languages like German!

19	15 22 11 26 33 2 24 35 21 9 19	I bet this guy will be a leader one day.
19	1 32 2 20 7 8 25 29 13 21 19	Hopefully that stuff is good for them.
19	23 16 29 14 6 32 33 11 12 24 19	I am sure your skinny self can fit out that.
19	21 13 23 27 31 28 30 29 17 14 19	Lovely spot to spend an afternoon
19	33 8 29 3 28 18 2 31 24 34 19	This rive will lead to paradisde.
19	23 4 3 26 33 13 5 25 2 7 19	This kid is going to go places
19	1 8 18 34 35 31 32 6 12 25 19	A good boy out on his walk!

19	21 33 25 14 6 13 26 17 30 8 19	I can make it to the top
19	8 12 25 27 11 10 6 20 29 34 19	This beautiful flower bloomed today. I can't wait for more blooms to blossom and fill my tree.
19	17 5 6 29 16 30 27 22 18 8 19	I think the horse will be able to make that jump
19	22 14 30 6 10 32 8 17 3 13 19	I see this an opportunity to make the best of the city.
19	7 34 8 24 1 21 12 3 15 20 19	I don't think this will take too long.
19	15 29 9 31 35 18 32 34 26 21 19	Spring has arrived, and with it, hope for the future.
19	35 16 2 5 20 31 17 27 1 8 19	That baby looks like a deep think, destined for great things!
19	16 5 20 11 28 3 22 30 32 27 19	Stretching would be so great to do every day!
19	25 26 3 28 20 22 27 2 11 4 19	Soon the real astronauts will be in the real moon

19	2 25 1 21 29 14 18 30 13 28 19	Well it has to rain sometime soon
19	15 13 2 17 4 30 21 7 9 35 19	Well, we all had to learn. Those cars fast and take a little practice to get used to.
20	25 4 14 22 18 32 8 19 11 27 20	This is clearly a well formed pose for the photo.
20	14 24 10 16 5 28 22 23 29 1 20	These are very uniformed silo's.
20	23 33 30 6 8 27 29 9 4 35 20	The plants are very eccentric
20	33 1 4 10 30 6 24 35 29 34 20	Animals. A part of our existence, a part of our lives. Where would we be without them?

21	7 30 20 4 10 22 11 16 34 24 21	I would just walk on the sidewalk and avoid the uneven surface.
21	15 2 28 34 30 13 8 14 26 5 21	The parrot is listening really well.
21	16 23 32 28 27 9 33 18 31 14 21	This hill will take several hours to hike
21	5 20 26 27 13 8 23 2 25 14 21	This man just finished a 12 hours shift at work and couldn't even wait until the train began to move before dozing off.
21	9 11 17 20 10 25 18 35 31 24 21	I will try to find a seat before it gets too crowded.
21	35 14 31 12 1 2 17 15 32 20 21	I should join them in a friendly game of golf.
21	15 33 6 1 5 28 4 25 34 12 21	This man is probably established in his life because he is cleancut and well dressed.
21	6 31 18 35 30 13 9 15 10 25 21	That is a nice array of stars.
21	5 8 1 28 26 2 7 23 19 27 21	This must be a historic site.
21	23 18 16 22 24 8 14 30 26 15 21	We are awaiting instructions from our team leaders before we venture out.
21	17 1 28 22 12 26 3 25 15 29 21	The bees and other pollinators are attracted to the flowers color as well as scent.
21	33 15 16 18 12 14 3 32 24 5 21	That food looks well prepared
21	5 34 13 15 4 32 23 33 25 2 21	Watch out with that white shirt!
21	34 25 30 20 8 35 4 29 19 14 21	This lady is definitely making a speech.
21	7 6 10 20 18 28 23 4 2 1 21	Here lies the body of someone who is now a soul.
21	34 17 28 16 8 14 25 3 5 19 21	This car is way to fast.
21	33 23 22 18 9 3 26 4 1 15 21	They must be performing a play.
21	26 32 3 7 22 20 4 35 9 13 21	This picture would only make sense from far away.
21	27 24 20 7 32 22 11 15 5 13 21	If I keep my tools in my back pocket, it makes them easy to grab.
21	3 32 31 16 7 6 5 26 10 8 21	These flowers are beautiful to look at but they will definitely attract a lot of bees.
21	1 6 23 32 4 35 14 34 20 15 21	The fan is a souvenir from a day out.
21	9 24 13 22 7 2 8 23 18 1 21	It was a good idea to put the flowers on all the windows to make it look cohesive.
21	16 30 26 31 4 32 24 17 19 23 21	Her shorts do not look comfortable.
21	7 15 9 4 24 35 33 29 27 32 21	The man is answering questions
21	4 13 1 30 7 22 26 20 18 28 21	All the items on the menu are the same price except the salad.
21	29 3 10 17 19 20 22 33 14 5 21	Leaving all of those bottles there is wasteful.
21	15 31 27 2 10 6 23 20 30 4 21	They must be going to an event.
21	4 8 6 19 33 9 7 22 28 30 21	It would make so much more sense to clean up before it gets this bad!
21	26 35 20 29 22 15 18 14 32 1 21	I don't think that chain is protecting anything.
21	34 10 19 13 24 23 14 12 3 32 21	The angle, Bokeh, and light are all off by a factor of 1.
21	22 32 9 6 25 18 12 3 10 1 21	These horses are likely eating together because they're a wild herd.
21	15 28 4 29 5 12 23 18 16 25 21	Girls playing lacrosse and calculating every move to win the game
21	32 14 13 25 6 28 24 16 18 33 21	Just a few drinks in hand
21	5 34 13 2 14 29 30 28 18 8 21	This bird can probably hurt the bald eagle.
21	16 31 24 7 25 28 6 13 19 29 21	They must have a good reason to be like this.
21	19 33 30 31 10 18 16 6 9 8 21	that is a dodge charger. I know this from seeing charger on the grill
21	25 18 15 5 16 19 17 29 28 30 21	His feet are probably wet.
21	3 2 1 19 7 32 10 12 16 4 21	You can tell that it is carved from marble because of the striations in the stone.
21	12 16 17 35 4 11 7 24 32 25 21	I'm not sure, but this sees like a train station.
21	5 25 32 18 6 2 24 15 19 17 21	This appears to be a fairly wide river.
21	10 26 16 33 35 7 3 4 27 19 21	These priests are wearing zucchetto  as part of their required outfit.
21	28 11 35 27 16 3 5 6 26 30 21	This is a true Minny Mouse fan since she is wearing a matching tshirt and hat.
21	13 30 15 23 19 9 10 8 20 2 21	The skewers are used to make the fish easier to cook.
21	18 25 13 20 7 26 34 31 15 10 21	He is very reflective literally.
21	5 28 20 30 9 13 2 25 23 7 21	This says that noodles are spicy.
21	3 30 35 20 28 23 24 5 13 31 21	What are we looking at here?
21	19 30 2 13 25 28 6 15 32 17 21	I'll have to look up what this means.
21	3 30 10 17 25 32 34 5 18 15 21	A truly cared for lawn.
21	25 7 18 33 20 31 15 30 1 4 21	This band is connected to the Chicago White Sox.
21	5 26 25 3 13 11 15 14 7 10 21	This is a beautiful location- probably on the west coast.
21	17 27 34 30 26 10 18 13 16 4 21	That cage does not look strong enough to contain a grown tiger.
21	16 9 7 31 5 10 11 1 19 23 21	This must be a studio.
21	18 22 23 1 33 35 13 27 17 7 21	That gate may have held in some livestock.
21	9 15 24 29 16 22 8 30 2 1 21	They will be very tired soon.
21	17 7 26 2 28 33 24 10 19 22 21	Looks like nice weather for a festival
21	7 28 3 1 26 5 16 11 18 31 21	I'm so happy to see people adopting instead of buying designer dogs.
21	20 6 8 27 10 3 34 16 31 2 21	By heating the air inside the balloon, the burners allow the pilot to control the lift of the craft
21	5 11 18 26 29 32 1 15 16 20 21	A career as a construction worker offers good pay and a high likelihood of finding employment.
21	20 31 23 32 29 5 15 19 34 30 21	A stunning little church in such a great looking location
21	17 11 32 23 35 26 29 30 5 6 21	The ref might be an idiot, but his decision is final get on with it guys
21	2 34 24 16 14 4 31 8 32 13 21	I think I would drive the speed limit.
21	17 16 1 32 28 19 18 11 30 34 21	I can win this race.
21	1 34 20 35 27 11 29 17 28 19 21	It must have taken some time to construct these snow feet.
21	18 29 13 3 34 26 32 2 24 35 21	All the points seem to connect.
21	32 28 7 13 30 23 16 1 6 29 21	It doesn't seem like hockey should be played with this many people around.
21	19 22 8 30 4 29 15 17 13 23 21	The birds are preparing to fly south for winter
21	26 3 33 29 7 20 1 35 25 31 21	A building this small probably can't serve many customers at once.
21	22 9 28 34 8 6 17 3 33 30 21	They are running in a very well planned out way with good form.
21	9 16 33 3 27 30 13 28 8 35 21	This door would appear to be somewhat unfinished.
21	27 34 8 26 2 4 17 20 7 3 21	There are many awards on the wall.
21	19 2 31 24 35 9 13 8 18 12 21	He spends 5.2 seconds on each autograph
21	30 19 4 9 10 34 6 8 24 33 21	The landscape has been barren by the cold temperatures and snow.
21	7 10 27 28 11 18 19 23 5 9 21	What a stupid and boring play
21	23 20 8 18 9 15 4 6 24 1 21	This street is too narrow.
21	29 8 12 35 5 30 18 34 24 13 21	This looks like a farm in a southern country, maybe South America.
21	5 30 2 16 1 10 23 25 27 33 21	It is nice to be able to view such beautiful creation.
21	9 14 12 15 3 27 17 25 32 28 21	This architecture is very well done.
21	26 29 1 15 23 30 25 24 28 20 21	That is a small pool.
21	20 33 23 7 13 1 15 11 35 6 21	He better be careful with the baby.
21	14 32 4 12 5 29 2 23 26 11 21	Both pilings seem equal in length.
21	12 14 1 27 10 31 18 8 35 11 21	This play was well thought out and the manuscript was wonderful.
21	6 7 13 20 29 11 27 23 35 24 21	They seem like a talent bunch.
21	3 30 17 32 8 20 10 19 27 22 21	The sun is out, and shining off of the buildings.
21	4 6 30 15 1 20 17 2 9 24 21	Actually, I'm not sure if one person alone could end MS, unless maybe they're a super genius scientist or something...
21	35 9 5 14 13 32 8 4 23 22 21	The pitch was probably not a strike
21	16 14 6 30 33 13 7 27 9 11 21	That display is too crowded.
21	4 19 34 20 9 26 25 31 23 22 21	They have the steel up the wood is next
21	10 16 32 33 27 8 18 11 30 35 21	He will speak first, then she will take over.
21	9 13 35 6 25 33 11 10 14 7 21	This body of water looks like an ideal place to kayak and enjoy other water activities.
21	2 17 28 35 25 14 32 31 11 34 21	Proper bike riding always follows a clear linear pattern.
21	3 28 24 13 15 16 19 11 17 12 21	There is a movie playing tonight.
21	22 5 8 34 10 28 32 11 25 26 21	A great view from this side.
21	23 17 1 19 30 33 20 14 11 32 21	This cat could fit into this bag.
21	24 11 9 32 25 29 31 18 22 16 21	Odd numbers make better presentation.
21	35 1 18 33 2 16 30 7 29 3 21	These seem to be little snowballs rolling down a slope.
21	9 32 11 26 23 1 33 19 12 20 21	This is written in a foreign language.
21	19 15 23 27 14 28 10 3 12 13 21	Ok, its blue, i mean the color of the sky!
21	12 31 6 9 16 33 3 11 22 18 21	The only explanation is that the camera was focused way too closely.
21	29 30 17 8 12 2 34 35 26 9 21	The fungus is feeding off the decomposing organic material and thrives in a damp environment.
21	28 19 4 18 11 2 14 6 31 22 21	The structure of airports and how they're run is very strict for a good reason
21	35 33 4 6 17 5 12 15 22 19 21	I hope he can't get through that fence
21	20 14 9 7 29 17 4 30 12 8 21	I chose to plant this specific species of plant here to provide cover in the summer from onlookers.
21	2 3 16 1 26 7 9 29 18 10 21	They need to finish filming before they lose all lighting.
21	1 27 32 7 35 28 15 2 3 10 21	I don't think I'd be able to survive in these ruins.
21	6 25 27 18 34 5 16 7 9 13 21	he isnt really in the fbi
21	7 27 32 2 24 18 29 11 22 10 21	Those pads and helmets are for her own safety.
21	8 29 13 14 1 35 15 30 23 25 21	This is probably one of her last birthdays.
21	8 9 12 2 20 18 32 30 16 14 21	The red lights create a specific mood to appeal to the audience.
21	33 31 12 25 8 27 16 20 32 1 21	Both the root and the froot ðŸ¤”
21	29 27 17 2 32 33 6 35 20 19 21	The table is too full. People will be irritated by lack of space.
21	6 30 35 5 34 22 25 26 1 17 21	They look like tourists enjoying an eye-catching scenery.
21	17 8 31 5 29 9 1 4 22 16 21	This is probably a school of literature.
21	22 19 13 30 25 28 1 34 24 6 21	This barge isdelivering important goods to somewhere.
21	20 33 16 17 12 25 9 15 30 24 21	This man must be hard at work in the dirt.
21	33 32 2 18 26 10 5 25 11 8 21	This person can not fly.
21	20 23 14 31 26 11 30 1 7 8 21	People standing, an entire family all together at once.
21	8 17 23 11 34 29 2 1 31 7 21	she looks like a very rational little girl drinking water rather then soft drinks
21	35 27 29 25 24 7 18 14 30 31 21	sun, see & sand. must be a holiday
21	19 31 29 1 30 9 6 26 25 5 21	Green is not a primary color; it is made up of yellow and blue.
21	7 24 33 20 9 1 15 32 26 35 21	They are storing the wine incorrectly.
21	12 28 17 14 22 3 24 13 29 25 21	Their formation are precise, as that is what is required if deployed to war.
21	32 8 10 22 27 28 9 13 29 35 21	I'm sure there must be some rhyme & reason behind this, but my ordered mind can't see it.
21	10 32 25 7 14 28 18 15 34 31 21	They've got about another 4 hours left of heat in that fire.
21	8 29 33 12 19 14 30 15 3 22 21	It's too wet to drive.
21	2 8 11 33 26 18 4 20 32 10 21	That bird is very colorful.
21	17 19 33 34 24 31 32 1 15 28 21	This must be a family gathering of some sort
21	13 24 6 18 30 17 23 5 10 33 21	Kids playing some sports in a field. They joined a league and are being competitive.
21	6 17 20 29 4 23 11 16 27 32 21	This port is crucial to the economy of the city, without it, industry would be at a standstill.
21	27 26 33 22 5 16 9 11 4 28 21	This looks like a natural landscape.
21	33 22 28 4 5 32 16 9 23 15 21	When there is baby at home, that home will be filled with happiness.
21	15 33 34 16 12 8 28 17 32 26 21	They planned those colored seats out perfectly to spell colorado.
21	25 9 16 3 4 30 15 6 31 18 21	Fall or winter in this picture since the leaves have fallen off of the trees.
21	5 33 1 29 28 24 7 32 31 11 21	It seems as though this is a sporting event, most likely football or rugby based on the goal posts and end zone.
21	9 28 30 15 24 25 33 6 26 29 21	Must be for a wedding reception.
21	1 25 17 32 7 26 3 9 18 5 21	We will back into the dock so we can drive straight out tomorrow.
21	14 18 22 19 10 32 15 2 31 6 21	Just breathe in with the nose and out with the mouth.
21	3 13 29 16 26 18 14 4 1 6 21	These nice cars are ready to race.
21	15 32 16 27 30 31 14 17 26 29 21	It's definitely a good idea to tie your shoes before you run.
21	32 18 26 17 24 34 9 11 8 14 21	I bet this area provides homes for a lot of working class people.
21	29 30 11 18 23 5 16 25 17 32 21	Looks very old and hard to read, someone should clean it
21	11 23 15 12 22 19 34 4 24 28 21	This lake probably has lots of fish.
21	26 24 10 27 18 16 22 33 2 7 21	It would be helpful if the lighting was brighter.
21	7 25 18 23 4 22 30 12 26 32 21	That is a unique structure.
21	25 11 29 16 33 18 15 32 13 19 21	The mirror placement would make it hard to see cars on the road
21	11 29 31 4 23 8 32 33 25 27 21	Putting a reflective surface on the railing like that will reduce accidents.
21	16 18 11 25 29 6 19 35 22 15 21	Babies seem to make people happy
21	1 10 28 9 25 31 13 18 34 27 21	After listening to his speach anyone could see he made some very valid points.
21	30 23 6 11 15 24 3 29 25 35 21	It must be autumn somewhere.
21	32 31 24 1 14 30 35 16 20 2 21	It is safe to assume that the planks behind the sign is of the Velux brand.
21	19 11 15 23 4 20 3 22 24 6 21	This thing was formed by condensed water vapour.
21	32 33 5 20 11 10 2 26 29 8 21	Look at those beautiful cirrus clouds!
21	4 30 29 19 7 31 1 25 3 2 21	It is good that these motorcyclists are wearing helmets because helmets protect your head from injury if you have a motorcycle accident.
21	23 20 6 14 18 9 1 7 31 2 21	Nice job! We all need to learn how to work together from a young age.
21	19 17 33 25 34 23 9 3 7 24 21	This guy isn't getting good reception.
21	16 9 1 8 2 22 11 31 7 34 21	Dual booting computers need lots of screen space.
21	18 16 22 25 20 4 8 17 2 5 21	They must be in a race.  The angle, outfit and small crowd make sense.
21	23 13 25 26 28 10 2 4 5 16 21	That looks like a lovely dessert, I'm sure much preparation went into it.
21	16 31 25 10 22 4 35 12 8 3 21	The boats may crash into each other.
21	20 1 29 6 15 12 30 28 5 31 21	Unless the group comes apart some, the racers in the back will never move forward.
21	33 34 19 30 4 16 13 26 28 8 21	This is out of place.
22	15 31 27 24 20 8 35 7 13 33 22	this looks like a weird couple....
22	7 35 30 12 25 26 34 11 3 20 22	That dog is like a cat, his owner knows.
22	33 14 7 18 11 5 2 27 34 3 22	Jump I will catch you.
22	13 12 9 33 26 21 35 17 34 5 22	i wonder how long he trained to take part in that marathon!
22	30 9 16 3 2 25 27 14 18 10 22	To the right, is him 5 years ago.
22	3 29 7 32 24 19 6 15 28 20 22	What a nice lake to swim in, even at night!
22	16 9 17 23 8 35 28 10 25 13 22	They're looking for the toilet paper.

23	14 6 15 34 12 26 32 28 19 17 23	The darkness in this city is like the darkness in my own sad life.
23	1 15 32 33 22 11 27 30 12 10 23	Why would I want to go into the park? It will be crappy.
23	17 24 32 13 2 3 28 35 5 12 23	why would they do that!?
23	13 12 5 1 22 25 35 9 21 28 23	They dance together now, but I can't help but think what their divorce will be like.
23	31 24 3 19 28 30 9 12 20 2 23	Someone wasted their time stacking this.
23	31 26 3 34 8 10 35 18 17 22 23	Most people find joy in places like this but I find joy in nothing now.
23	1 34 7 29 16 9 35 19 13 31 23	the player in the green shirt is suffering from poison ivy
23	6 10 31 26 20 1 8 17 12 21 23	Poor girls looks like she is lost in the woods.
23	10 9 22 8 19 1 28 26 20 3 23	Well this seems unnecessary, a show of "force".
23	34 11 2 13 27 12 8 18 6 17 23	If only I had the guts to go to the beach by myself.
23	7 15 5 10 31 29 4 11 21 18 23	This lady on the right looks like she's having a horrible time!
23	7 1 18 33 6 9 4 28 8 32 23	I hate seeing people out having fun like this when I'm just stuck in at home by myself.
23	34 15 9 31 8 29 19 25 6 32 23	I seriously hate this bar.
23	29 4 17 5 12 11 10 30 2 26 23	This car will get towed, I can see it now.
23	31 20 9 2 21 4 5 8 19 35 23	Poor kids, not even a proper bowling alley :(
23	10 33 20 18 8 9 12 21 1 26 23	Parties... What a waste... As if I knew, I just stay cooped up inside all day.
23	33 14 7 29 19 13 2 15 1 26 23	This guy looks to be having some fun, unlike me.
23	11 13 16 21 5 15 24 33 4 27 23	I really dont care about their body language.
23	29 33 20 10 12 35 2 28 9 27 23	I"m sure this remote doesn't work at all.
23	24 32 2 12 19 17 30 5 14 13 23	The flowers help me cope in the worst of times.
23	10 25 29 32 11 28 20 9 19 18 23	He should go eat, people don't know how to take care of kids.
23	33 10 1 5 3 28 8 15 13 25 23	This kid looks like she wants to eat so bad!
23	33 15 6 20 12 26 11 25 31 3 23	I would hate to be here, it looks too hot.
23	13 33 8 5 29 16 22 17 21 11 23	I hate doing pullups, this is one of those places.
23	20 12 9 32 24 25 22 8 17 28 23	He's going to get only a few bucks in tips for all that.
23	33 25 3 8 26 29 5 22 11 15 23	The place is so run down, it would be a crappy night spent there.
23	5 33 25 8 32 17 27 7 30 13 23	There are too many lights and I don't know who could be there.
23	27 13 10 24 33 3 31 22 20 25 23	What boring colors, I wouldn't go here.
23	31 35 12 32 1 3 29 22 17 4 23	This is how I feel when people call me beautiful
23	14 10 30 6 1 18 12 25 17 34 23	This is the most boring conversation ever.
23	21 9 24 30 7 14 20 16 12 8 23	What a drudge of a remodeling job.
23	18 15 34 30 10 20 19 5 27 29 23	The canyon is just a such an awful place to be in the summer its just so hot.
23	18 28 13 10 5 14 27 15 9 29 23	and I'm supposed to EAT that?
23	33 4 22 19 31 5 26 34 29 9 23	Oh that looks hot and quite unpleasant.
23	8 28 34 22 27 26 18 9 2 7 23	There is too much food here. I would rather go somewhere where there is better options.
23	31 33 25 15 29 28 34 2 1 18 23	He's not very enthused about dancing I don't think
23	6 34 24 17 5 26 20 18 12 16 23	I hate the way people treat horses now a days
23	14 2 24 30 7 35 16 15 22 28 23	There is no sunshine on the patio, so gloomy.
23	30 7 31 2 11 5 15 1 26 21 23	The dog looks as if it is living in a filthy environment.
23	28 6 18 10 34 35 24 2 25 31 23	Great, 6. It's the unlucky number before 7.
23	31 7 21 9 30 14 34 33 22 4 23	In hindsight, I shouldn't have told her I cheated while we were driving through the desert. Now I'm alone, without water or a phone. Oh dear God I'm gonna die.
23	4 24 6 26 18 27 1 10 12 34 23	This cat looks like it is hungry again.
23	2 8 34 27 17 1 26 21 19 14 23	This landscape too will fall victim to human consumption.
23	28 18 13 30 35 25 5 12 7 34 23	She reminds me of my cheating ex-wife.
23	11 26 21 20 27 7 25 5 2 31 23	this was my view all day while waiting on my plane
23	28 11 8 13 25 19 21 14 7 30 23	They are loosing, there is no hope for them to win.
23	17 25 12 6 27 5 24 34 13 8 23	What a terrible way to spend in afternoon.  Hot and in a crowd of people.
23	24 21 31 27 2 16 1 18 25 35 23	Ugh, road trips are the worst.  Boring and tedious and hot.
23	32 15 27 14 19 18 24 2 6 29 23	This balloon reminds me of a nightlight and I cant sleep with a nightlight.
23	1 9 10 28 30 7 35 21 29 26 23	it is a nice garden to see
23	20 1 17 19 21 4 8 13 10 22 23	It looks so hot out there.
23	4 10 22 35 32 18 8 7 20 30 23	Why aren't there more flowers!
23	26 21 12 8 18 2 32 25 27 28 23	These shoes make me want to puke.
23	5 26 7 4 14 27 1 28 35 29 23	A whole building being eaten alive by invasive vines.
23	19 32 34 20 8 30 26 7 15 4 23	This water just makes me think of terrible rain.
23	18 22 26 14 7 25 5 21 19 15 23	The backpack that is nearly as big as he is dwarfs his short, skinny frame. He has to balance on the balls of his feet to prevent the weight from pulling him backward.
23	33 21 9 13 31 25 7 30 18 3 23	I bet it is really hot and humid on that boat.
23	33 3 16 18 9 35 26 29 21 32 23	God, I can not stand this cake or this wedding!
23	20 13 14 11 27 10 9 4 19 8 23	I hate marching bands.  The practicing for hours on end is a real noise nuisance to the neighborhood.
23	32 18 27 11 21 24 2 34 8 6 23	IT looks so hot and everyone is getting sunburnt.
23	18 30 20 21 29 31 33 28 16 9 23	snow may be beautiful but it hurts just to think of it since my fall when i was a kid cold, and even more so cold and wet just cripples me
23	2 22 13 26 27 12 31 1 30 19 23	He was so happy then.
23	22 25 14 3 17 18 9 21 1 12 23	Those light are hurting my eyes i need to look away
23	12 4 10 34 7 32 15 14 21 16 23	The order of ukuleles are never ending.
23	24 19 12 10 28 4 11 17 8 27 23	These girls must want to go home.
23	17 14 24 32 9 30 12 20 26 31 23	Why are these peeople even around each other?
23	27 18 20 6 4 13 19 30 32 1 23	This just makes me sick. I can't even tell what it is.
23	32 21 4 6 30 18 24 14 7 10 23	I love this car...too bad I'll never be able to afford one...
23	9 4 33 29 15 6 7 8 27 10 23	That's gonna be a nightmare to drive in, as if this day could get any worse...
23	20 32 27 33 1 6 13 2 11 21 23	If I have to look at one more tomb!
23	34 32 9 7 1 17 33 5 22 3 23	How am I going to get around this tree? Life doesn't work out for me.
23	33 10 18 7 6 24 28 2 17 25 23	These make me think of my dark mood.
23	24 8 21 2 3 22 34 32 5 15 23	They look like they're having fun. I miss having fun.
23	12 7 10 22 6 34 29 11 27 28 23	I just wish this had been taken from inside the building instead of outside. You can't even see the colors very well!
23	24 30 13 26 35 27 16 17 4 1 23	I hate when my food is touching!
23	12 25 8 1 14 15 22 5 35 13 23	I will never have coffee again.
23	28 33 22 16 11 14 32 2 12 34 23	Boy do I have sun-stroke after today.
23	10 26 8 21 2 5 25 34 13 20 23	Oh how will things ever grow well here?
23	29 4 6 19 10 15 28 32 31 27 23	This noise combined with this many people would surely increase my anxiety.
23	34 15 35 27 16 6 7 1 19 3 23	That church looks lifeless and intimidating with the guards at the door.
23	11 13 6 27 12 15 24 5 9 26 23	Oh my gosh! I cannot drink one more cup of coffee today!!
23	14 25 12 3 1 33 4 30 31 27 23	I am so bored by this lake.
23	30 2 8 18 26 21 19 7 34 15 23	I am so bored of this view.
23	35 8 2 28 4 16 27 10 3 9 23	Cherry tomatoes are tasteless mush from California
23	6 15 9 32 13 26 19 30 1 34 23	I hate this kind of music!
23	19 26 10 8 9 25 30 7 2 3 23	You can see how uninterested he is from his facial expression.
23	10 21 9 19 35 25 17 27 5 3 23	Those plants will make you itch something terrible.
23	25 1 12 20 13 10 7 31 14 28 23	Haaah... this dog looks nice. I guess. A window into a world I will never be a part of.
23	25 5 22 1 11 13 4 9 6 21 23	That poor horse looks like it's not well taken care of.
23	9 27 25 33 8 18 16 12 22 30 23	I wish I could afford such a view. Once again, life didn't choose me as a winner.
23	10 16 33 15 7 12 9 22 17 20 23	Look how far away and small that building looks. I wonder if the train just stops right in front of it and blocks everyone's view.
23	27 31 21 6 11 7 15 32 1 14 23	This guy looks like a bore
23	20 15 31 25 8 9 30 26 34 27 23	It isn't good seeing an unpainted, unfinished sign.
23	34 33 3 12 16 20 17 35 28 21 23	Excellent tastings! That I envy, I also want
23	20 3 12 16 17 15 9 11 8 31 23	If I drove in a race like that I'd just die.
23	10 24 6 29 8 19 21 15 7 25 23	I don't like that there is no woman in that band
23	25 24 2 3 30 22 31 21 5 35 23	i think is not miserable.they are watching somthing
23	17 30 14 18 24 7 11 5 33 9 23	These need to be arranged properly.
23	13 19 28 20 1 26 22 3 7 4 23	I will never be able to acquire a boat that nice.
23	14 19 11 7 29 18 10 31 34 35 23	Poor dog look like he's not having a good time .ahh i would take him home !!
23	11 18 3 6 14 21 28 12 1 26 23	I hate looking at this. It makes me sick.
23	6 33 24 16 29 20 5 11 7 32 23	I can't believe these people are actually allowed to run the organization it is awful.
23	28 1 31 7 29 11 12 9 25 21 23	I can't stand seeing nothing but mountains they are such a bore.
23	10 34 4 25 31 21 14 28 33 6 23	People need to get in doors.
23	20 7 27 14 34 35 10 31 32 2 23	I would feel so darn cold up there.
23	8 6 27 10 15 17 19 22 7 3 23	This is such a boring view.
23	13 24 10 25 17 21 12 16 20 35 23	Like hulk, i feel sad inside, im ugly outside
23	6 9 33 7 34 26 8 20 11 3 23	Parasailing looks like it would hurt something awful - the wind blowing debris in your eyes, the rope burning your hands, and of course the sand which is course and irritating.
23	32 18 28 29 6 7 12 34 27 14 23	I hate crowds... I'd feel awful being in the middle of that
23	10 25 32 33 3 17 7 29 35 4 23	Lord knows I cannot stand those godforsaken ducks!
23	8 11 10 27 2 12 30 16 3 33 23	The tree looks damaged... like me
23	21 19 25 22 14 29 16 26 8 15 23	He probably got a statue because he killed a lot of people.
23	13 25 22 7 17 24 20 26 34 30 23	I think it is clear who has the best priorities.
23	13 3 32 30 33 6 18 35 31 21 23	Seeing that makes me want to vomit.
23	12 21 5 31 34 16 25 4 26 2 23	This will be a long boring ride.
23	14 4 34 18 8 33 15 6 16 32 23	I'll never have anything as nice as this.
23	17 5 1 35 3 25 12 31 33 26 23	I hate people that wear feathers. Why do they wear them, and such an ugly color. Why is it placed on some ugly crossword puzzle too. Could they not think of anything better
23	24 6 11 12 29 10 18 16 3 33 23	Why can't I ever go to a restaurant and no one is there?
23	2 31 26 24 21 22 15 3 6 32 23	This cat looks a thousand times happier than I will EVER be.
23	31 30 8 22 7 17 15 16 26 12 23	What even is this? I should probably know that, I'm so dumb...
23	26 8 19 13 14 35 12 16 15 4 23	I will never go to a place like that.
23	20 1 24 18 13 2 15 22 9 7 23	WHy are we out here in the heat?
23	24 2 6 35 29 33 10 25 18 12 23	Their arms must hurt so bad from rowing!
23	26 29 21 1 17 12 15 32 35 27 23	Pictures of smiling people always make me jealous.
23	5 11 20 4 35 21 19 32 17 28 23	This place looks sad because of that weapon like metal
23	22 27 24 10 20 9 5 15 17 1 23	why on earth would you want to get invovled with this.
23	16 22 2 26 11 7 27 35 20 33 23	This weather makes me sick.
23	10 7 18 16 8 20 9 13 11 27 23	It looks so hot and terrible.
23	30 33 27 6 3 17 1 18 5 8 23	I wish I had a pet cat. I can't so I am depressed.
23	6 29 34 30 4 9 32 3 22 8 23	Lonely and grey, like my whole life.
23	8 4 15 21 24 28 22 31 32 9 23	The lizard does not look as happy as the girl.
23	7 31 26 21 18 2 5 24 1 17 23	Ugh, not another family dinner I can't stand it. Why do I have to see this stuff every day?
23	22 11 4 30 32 33 10 21 35 2 23	This guy's outfit make me sad that I cannot achieve anything in life.
23	15 28 22 32 24 9 25 14 20 27 23	My daughter should not be effected from my bad financial status, if not life will be sorrowful.
23	18 6 1 2 17 14 8 12 4 35 23	The number of people and the air makes me feel feverish
23	26 29 9 2 12 19 28 31 25 3 23	I'd hate to hear that gong.
23	4 7 3 5 24 8 17 13 28 12 23	This jump could have been so perfect.
23	34 21 18 11 31 19 25 32 33 8 23	I thought I would enjoy our trek, but after the questionable breakfast that has upset my stomach, I feel like retching and just want to go home.
23	29 15 19 34 24 26 18 7 31 17 23	Here we go again, more monuments to our government that makes our lives a living Hell
23	30 6 5 19 13 7 17 32 26 14 23	Oh God it's a spider I hate spiders
23	9 16 2 12 33 8 15 35 26 6 23	I am so tired!  I just want to go home.
23	33 7 28 1 31 6 11 29 15 26 23	Looks like such a run down diner.
23	30 5 18 26 15 14 22 31 19 11 23	The clutter is angering me .
23	19 13 25 33 30 12 20 4 10 16 23	Another crappy night in the midwest
23	2 19 6 12 4 15 3 14 26 20 23	Looks amazing... which breaks my heart because mine never come out like that...
23	17 22 21 5 9 30 10 15 11 33 23	this place very nice and super ideal place
23	2 34 18 12 30 17 19 32 22 15 23	I really hate fireworks. What is there to celebrate anyways?
23	33 24 22 32 11 25 9 28 29 35 23	Augh, it looks like its about to rain, so gross
23	33 12 6 15 32 5 11 3 22 27 23	All those plants and water are probably harboring bugs.
23	13 4 29 21 19 25 30 2 22 17 23	Those chords are just gonna tangle
23	26 12 3 5 10 32 7 14 24 15 23	This just reminds me of how dark and desperate life is
23	32 2 9 34 16 29 14 31 20 1 23	I wish I had a little house. I am homeless.
23	28 15 6 1 34 5 31 12 16 2 23	I would be dying from a run way before I even got the race number on.  She doesn't even seem to enjoy this.
23	6 10 11 24 27 21 34 9 28 5 23	I remember having a garage made out of plywood like that. It was right before my wife divorced me and took the house.
23	33 32 19 16 12 14 34 24 20 2 23	I ride a tram like this to work everyday and also back home and I usually write practice suicide notes.
23	5 25 6 9 17 13 10 3 24 8 23	What a dungeon this is
23	18 3 35 6 11 28 33 13 19 2 23	everybody reach the high position in the world
23	12 7 19 10 8 21 1 25 16 3 23	I wish I was standing there and that spot of earth would open up and swallow me up.
23	3 28 26 34 18 31 13 15 29 25 23	Oh geeze, I wish I could be a fat happy woman instead of a fat old lady, how do they even do that. I mean they look attractive and I feel like a rotting watermelon.
23	12 21 33 19 35 14 31 22 10 1 23	I just hate it when there is no one around to talk to.
23	8 20 19 26 30 3 2 33 21 5 23	I could not enjoys this. Beauty is fleeting when your sad.
24	18 17 1 33 8 26 14 20 13 7 24	Why hasnâ€™t anyone cleaned off this car yet? Theyâ€™ll be late to work and wonâ€™t see where theyâ€™re driving
24	12 3 16 33 14 22 31 4 15 27 24	Dumb bird, I'd want to swat it away.
24	28 34 10 4 19 30 32 31 22 23 24	Yuck! I hate this restaurant.
24	21 4 8 32 9 10 6 26 16 29 24	So many lives lost...All gave some, some gave all.
24	35 21 5 9 17 20 22 10 1 23 24	There is nothing more pleasurable in this world than grabbing someone and scaring them.
24	3 33 21 26 5 32 28 17 16 1 24	This looks like a girl I could fight and win.
24	18 9 31 4 13 30 6 28 2 15 24	I would push her off of me.
24	15 32 26 23 1 27 2 25 5 35 24	She is squeezing that stone way to hard!
24	12 8 13 22 20 15 31 21 2 16 24	When you post something about RELIGION, bad things happen. TAKE THIS DOWN, it is inappropriate and infringes on my RIGHTS. I told the MODERATOR
24	18 17 34 20 1 6 2 22 35 11 24	Tell him not to hump over so much! The bride is almost hidden!
24	12 23 27 20 22 6 35 7 10 25 24	What's the point of a book you can't even read?
24	16 23 11 31 5 4 34 10 15 25 24	If everyone pulled forward ONE more car could fit here.
24	14 6 5 18 4 33 22 19 29 10 24	Somebody should really try and fight you guys.
24	35 13 32 28 6 4 2 25 1 31 24	He must be playing rock n roll, where's the mosh?
24	18 17 14 20 2 3 29 7 16 31 24	I hate it when they build houses so close to a ledge
24	18 16 20 30 11 2 5 29 12 15 24	I'd like to angrily hurl melons at passers by from the top floor!
24	26 34 32 6 21 18 28 4 10 33 24	I did not want to pull on the tree because I knew it would fall down, but of course, like always no one wanted to listen to me.
24	23 33 8 1 27 20 35 18 31 11 24	Home, home on the range!
24	18 11 27 12 1 10 15 29 6 26 24	This is the best crab period.
24	12 11 34 13 4 33 30 31 35 10 24	Ugh, how about you use some color next time!!
24	12 16 1 2 3 31 17 18 28 25 24	I need to eat there right now
24	28 20 27 33 35 4 21 5 10 17 24	I effing HATE when shadows mess up my picture.
24	34 21 28 25 5 35 1 2 6 18 24	They should be running, not being lazy!
24	8 14 31 23 6 29 7 30 35 26 24	I can't believe these people went kayaking without me, I thought we were good friends.
24	10 27 23 4 8 12 28 16 6 20 24	I can't believe that went out to the party that late at night, that was really irresponsible of the,
24	21 4 28 23 1 20 34 35 6 5 24	Children these days are flipping gang signs and posing with menacing fish! What is wrong with our youth?
24	13 35 34 15 6 31 27 32 21 33 24	A guy in a brown truck cut me off on the road today.  I really wanted to chase him down and say something.
24	13 17 7 30 34 8 5 19 25 20 24	That girl in the red shirt needs a spanking.
24	28 23 6 35 26 30 21 33 8 15 24	I want to smush that bug
24	17 21 10 11 18 32 14 1 31 27 24	I hope there isn't any alligator's in the water because they will eat those birds.
24	30 19 29 17 18 15 32 6 5 1 24	Rock concerts like this always make me want to punch someone or something.
24	22 23 27 7 20 34 15 12 18 33 24	This building will fall at our hands.
24	25 14 15 4 34 19 9 32 17 23 24	I would like to street race on these roads, they do not look very busy.
24	18 6 33 25 2 30 34 19 3 8 24	I would climb this so hard.
24	33 10 32 19 15 30 14 7 21 13 24	I bet his guy can barely even play the guitar.
24	31 3 4 19 9 5 15 28 35 34 24	the night is for winners
24	29 33 12 16 9 22 25 35 4 11 24	This is a really dumb and dark thing to look at!
24	29 4 8 35 14 16 3 34 17 10 24	The foliage in the front pisses me off
24	32 9 35 29 14 27 31 1 11 18 24	I want to rip the sign off the wall!
24	3 21 5 35 13 27 7 1 26 14 24	Big strong hug get ready
24	21 4 10 26 34 6 7 25 33 19 24	I want to climb fast and furious!
24	33 34 21 10 32 8 17 26 2 19 24	that bridge needs to go!
24	5 11 3 29 30 32 19 17 28 1 24	get that lady out of the picture and tell her to stop touching artifacts!
24	14 10 4 6 22 18 19 30 28 9 24	This overgrown yard is shamful. Someone needs to get to work or I'll call the homeowners association.
24	4 30 2 25 21 32 12 27 19 26 24	I'm so angry that I want to smash these with a hammer!
24	23 35 11 10 4 34 1 9 2 31 24	I'd love to race in the Grand Prix.
24	27 10 4 14 22 32 13 18 16 11 24	i hate that stupid statue
24	22 23 18 19 10 31 25 7 20 17 24	I will buy this figure before anyone else I know.
24	18 3 4 16 22 2 12 26 33 15 24	I would have ran on stage to perform my own songs.
24	31 33 13 19 35 10 12 21 32 8 24	He is a bad boy!
24	3 1 13 35 27 19 18 28 22 6 24	That drink looks disgusting. It looks like water that has been contaminated and I think the guy drinking it is going to get sick!
24	1 22 13 19 25 3 18 7 16 9 24	This chart is making me mad!
24	35 10 21 34 27 3 13 22 30 25 24	Who uses porcelain cats to hold notes? lmfao
24	32 21 9 29 15 10 31 7 13 17 24	Santa! get away from ym daughter!
24	13 4 14 15 8 25 22 10 2 20 24	Rich people should not be allowed to have such fancy houses when poor people are homeless.
24	3 34 5 20 18 4 10 13 8 31 24	Why would you even post this? Seriously this looks like a pixelated Google stock image.
24	1 8 14 4 23 21 22 28 7 34 24	There is too much laziness at this airport.
24	3 33 32 10 14 8 13 31 12 5 24	just once i wish they would stop parking their bike by my door
24	2 32 14 7 12 16 20 9 10 35 24	Is someone going to recreate this ship?
24	20 35 5 7 26 18 16 19 10 27 24	I want to hang up the phone on her.
24	28 26 22 6 7 14 10 5 35 11 24	This compound needs a better landscaping.
24	10 25 16 9 1 33 5 2 34 3 24	What a convoluted mixtures of colors. Makes my head spin. Horror!
24	1 26 9 18 3 12 30 16 34 2 24	You girls better take home the win!
24	8 19 35 30 31 23 27 17 26 20 24	This is a great location for some serious mountain climbing.
24	17 31 8 35 23 20 19 22 21 10 24	He needs to get a hustle on!
24	1 19 2 21 26 34 33 9 15 3 24	This girl is too scandalous! Put clothes on!
24	23 28 34 7 11 4 14 1 33 6 24	I will pick that plant and make it my own!
24	7 30 25 29 31 20 10 5 1 9 24	I want to hit you in the face, you look so stupid.
24	16 8 12 26 6 33 23 2 4 19 24	Is this supposed to be artistic? My kid could do better with Play-Doh.
24	13 15 26 29 30 3 25 16 20 28 24	Take that paint off right now!
24	26 35 16 22 31 29 18 3 13 17 24	That kid should get a kick in the shin for that move.
24	29 18 1 13 16 3 30 31 4 10 24	Someone has ripped the pants off that paper doll!
24	12 1 3 10 4 19 2 18 14 31 24	I wish they would just leave!
24	33 3 19 34 29 31 11 28 14 13 24	I want to take that microphone from her hands!
24	23 26 35 8 27 21 12 1 11 4 24	I hope these trains are retired.
24	12 4 15 8 20 9 3 19 6 33 24	DON'T PUT YOUR BOAT ANYWHERE NEAR ME
24	11 27 32 12 9 20 7 14 2 6 24	I hate this city, it ruined nature
24	14 34 20 10 5 2 22 13 30 6 24	How about you play with a real shark kid?
24	2 9 35 26 7 13 18 8 14 4 24	That parent better put his little brat back in the stroller if he knows whats good for him.
24	23 35 10 2 29 9 7 5 6 17 24	I want to burn that place down.
24	19 7 23 27 25 10 1 5 22 4 24	Come near me and I'll claw your eyes out!!!
24	14 3 17 2 35 32 11 23 21 16 24	QUIT SMOKING OR DIE FROM IT!
24	8 31 17 5 18 22 28 11 33 2 24	That little bird, looks innocent right? But it's actually a horrible pest! Every day I see birds like that out there, flying around, pecking at vegetables, and ruining the local vegetation!
24	8 6 21 15 18 7 33 29 23 22 24	I want to roll down that mountain and see what happens.
24	28 13 27 3 30 18 14 17 31 4 24	I want to smash all those flower pots.
24	1 3 32 13 5 15 14 7 30 4 24	I love the city, there is so much energy there, so much drive and determination around every corner.
24	1 15 28 9 31 23 3 14 30 10 24	Just because you put on fancy glasses, a shiny helmet and a skin tight shirt, it doesn't mean you'll actually SUCCEED at winning any kind of race.
24	31 23 22 3 33 27 13 15 4 34 24	Need to hurry up and find a table!
24	2 21 13 33 11 5 27 7 26 30 24	Happy after a nice sunny day
24	27 8 29 3 20 21 22 25 18 33 24	I want to smash these together!
24	29 4 26 27 9 33 22 31 3 5 24	They look like they're moving so slowly. HURRY UP!
24	19 6 25 4 32 22 33 13 31 17 24	He really needs to stop playing with his food. He is too old for that.
24	9 26 2 35 32 8 5 11 19 7 24	The plane looks like it is going to attack someone on the ground.
24	27 7 33 15 16 32 21 5 29 28 24	That road needs to be straitened now.
24	19 11 4 32 17 2 22 1 35 15 24	There is too much noise going on in there.
24	14 10 7 23 16 22 19 8 20 13 24	This image is very unprofessional and almost puts me to sleep. I feel like I need an hour nap just to recover.
24	30 18 10 21 1 2 13 22 8 6 24	i will destroy this art.
24	33 10 5 6 25 3 21 14 19 8 24	He showed them who is boss.  He's the man.
24	1 11 19 29 16 31 18 6 14 21 24	You are really ugly woman.
24	27 17 18 5 6 29 34 3 15 21 24	This is one of the worst restaurants in town.  I just hate it.
24	32 16 19 33 34 26 11 4 3 35 24	She seems to be upset what are you upset about!
24	10 4 26 11 18 32 25 22 27 7 24	I want to fight that guy!
24	8 6 34 14 22 26 17 30 33 10 24	I have a better Car than that! i dont like the orange!
24	7 29 28 22 18 34 13 19 32 5 24	Great place to have a fight
24	16 13 26 23 35 5 18 27 7 29 24	I could punch this stupid wall down in a second, grrrr!! Who cares about history?
24	3 13 30 32 8 4 20 10 15 19 24	I think he's in the way of the boats. He should move.
24	26 19 29 1 35 20 6 16 23 32 24	You are getting me wet instead.
24	23 2 10 4 19 29 11 9 35 17 24	The openness of the ball would make it easy to steal this one.
24	8 23 28 3 30 6 9 12 19 17 24	can't even greet fans Sean, you not relevant anymore
24	9 3 13 20 31 19 6 14 32 29 24	People really need to come out and fix the giant craters in our yard.
24	32 10 1 5 15 21 14 12 13 9 24	This tree is definitely falling on you
24	22 5 7 21 9 32 8 18 20 1 24	That guy's style is absolutely abysmal.
24	16 31 34 35 28 19 3 21 14 5 24	So many plants and trees. A perfect place to get bit by 1000s of bugs. Such a terrible place. I bet there are thousands of mosquitoes all the time. I hate them.
24	23 26 29 25 15 14 21 4 11 5 24	This plant is so ugly, no way I'd let that thing in the same room as me.
24	15 6 13 35 20 23 22 14 21 8 24	I hate these guys, they look like annoying hipsters!
24	25 18 35 28 23 1 21 6 11 13 24	What awful company has chopped down those trees to put in a carpark?!
24	19 16 11 20 34 26 25 5 32 21 24	I'd punch my neighbor if he left his lawn like this.
24	35 28 13 26 16 8 14 27 22 20 24	If I don't get out of this office and onto that beach soon I'm going to kill someone.
24	5 8 15 21 20 13 16 31 26 1 24	That saxophonist has got nothing on my skills, I'd play him out of a job!
24	6 22 17 4 13 12 19 21 27 35 24	Red makes me feel ragey.
24	9 14 10 34 25 35 17 29 1 12 24	The view is good, but, does the water have an oder?
24	7 9 22 15 4 35 2 1 14 17 24	This is a poor shot of this landscape. Change your perspective!
24	21 28 22 6 13 16 25 27 17 20 24	I want to cut that tree down!
24	15 35 29 1 13 5 33 6 20 22 24	This guy thinks he's strong?  I'd smash him if I were there.
24	10 30 27 14 29 18 2 15 21 4 24	Let's bring down those balloons!
24	5 3 16 22 2 12 21 10 14 26 24	Cop down these tress and and make a parking lot.
24	13 14 2 30 21 29 27 8 35 11 24	WOW! Look at these sky! Ahhh so beautiful!
24	22 8 17 3 11 32 19 14 9 6 24	I don't think that man should be touching that woman.
24	13 18 5 10 27 26 23 32 30 11 24	A shark is on the way to eat you up.
24	3 16 13 31 11 18 32 2 12 34 24	I hope a landslide happens on that mountain!
24	9 28 7 31 34 8 16 23 10 2 24	I'm hungry and I don't care, I'm stealing this!
24	20 31 18 6 33 26 13 30 2 22 24	Art with little clothing is not my favorite!
24	27 6 32 19 10 20 5 25 34 7 24	the tall building is something strange.. i feel asthough it gonna fall at anytime
24	25 33 8 12 19 34 7 9 17 11 24	I wanna kick that tree.
24	23 28 34 29 7 15 18 2 14 12 24	That whole in the clouds is big enough to fly a plane through.
24	9 3 21 28 10 17 14 16 30 32 24	This place could be controlled by the warlike mob.
24	4 11 26 12 30 25 27 13 10 31 24	That light should be smashed and broken.
24	25 17 10 3 34 32 14 27 26 28 24	This skateboarder is going so fast!
24	3 1 15 22 25 21 23 32 17 9 24	Just plow through that water!
24	13 16 21 14 2 35 32 19 29 10 24	Whenever the sun starts to go down I feel like tearing my eyes out!
24	18 31 27 32 14 17 8 25 13 6 24	I want to tear those out
24	8 29 34 19 30 1 6 25 27 11 24	I wanna tear that plant apart
24	33 4 6 9 3 1 2 18 34 12 24	That butterfly will probably get eaten
24	7 28 13 27 34 5 10 30 20 11 24	I'd love to smack that smile right off his smug looking face!
24	3 26 8 1 7 11 23 6 19 12 24	Politicians are not my favorite people. If I were king it would be off with their heads!
24	6 18 23 25 19 13 31 10 1 30 24	I just wish that bus wasn't there... ruins the dang photo.
24	12 3 5 35 2 20 16 17 28 25 24	The girl very smiling face the bos watching
24	34 32 23 21 2 1 27 5 11 29 24	Of course, runners blocking the road for everyone. Stay out of the way!
24	19 18 14 9 30 11 29 8 34 3 24	new furniture to the home
24	31 34 25 32 21 10 14 27 17 26 24	Smash that piece of junk!
24	20 33 25 15 9 1 35 14 8 19 24	Just rip all those weeds out
24	1 2 6 11 20 18 19 10 33 25 24	This symbol means to fight in Japense.
24	20 27 30 4 5 8 9 19 12 23 24	This car is firebird red.
24	29 12 19 13 16 17 35 3 28 4 24	I could really knock the lights out of these fools
24	18 31 1 13 34 27 28 14 12 20 24	This baby looks like he wants to be held by someone else.
24	17 1 32 21 9 14 18 19 29 23 24	This guy is hitting the dough very hard.
24	21 12 28 15 31 13 5 30 1 35 24	This is an outrage, that much skin should never be shown in public.
24	33 5 17 15 32 23 1 12 34 22 24	All these people all over the place look annoying and rude.
24	26 20 8 31 1 27 25 3 6 30 24	The boy i bullying the girl, he should be punished.
24	9 34 3 35 13 16 1 32 18 28 24	I'm not too fond of white shirts like this. They aren't the cutest
24	18 15 31 20 10 16 19 3 23 28 24	I want to pick these flowers and sell them .
24	5 14 31 9 22 25 23 18 33 21 24	I want to see more of this art now!
24	6 7 16 27 23 28 15 17 14 5 24	THis color really makes me angry!
24	16 26 33 6 7 30 34 35 29 22 24	Guitars make me so mad!
24	3 4 1 31 25 20 34 17 16 18 24	Yes! Let these brave men destroy those who would take away our freedom!
24	25 17 35 26 5 9 16 15 1 34 24	I'm going to fall over to that rock and break it.
24	29 31 1 9 12 11 8 19 14 32 24	Stop playing around you too!
24	16 34 27 32 9 15 23 3 5 13 24	The campus center show be open 24/7

26	33 15 34 20 17 6 18 31 22 1 26	How amusing it is to see people of different race enjoying each other's company
27	24 30 16 9 2 25 22 12 6 18 27	Guitar playing? Sounds like work.
27	13 10 1 15 20 35 34 30 31 24 27	I could never do this
27	31 28 26 5 18 12 6 14 3 35 27	Man, I'd go hang out in this park with these guys, but walking those two blocks is just...yeah, no.
27	29 16 5 34 11 6 17 33 10 22 27	This probably took way too long to paint.
27	4 3 31 34 12 14 20 1 28 32 27	Wonder how many houses are in that picture. Not gonna take the time to count.
27	25 8 33 11 24 23 4 1 16 7 27	Wonder how deep that water is. I don't really care that much though
27	14 23 6 15 2 11 33 5 16 26 27	That looks like a lot of work. Why don't they have chairs?
27	13 19 9 21 25 2 3 8 12 11 27	I'm not even going to try to fix my car. I'm just going to call AARP and have them take care of it.
27	26 29 12 16 8 11 14 17 23 3 27	did they have a uniform?
27	6 33 15 5 9 25 29 31 1 14 27	These men look like they work hard, not like me.
27	17 7 30 6 18 29 2 23 13 11 27	The moon reminds me it's time for bed.
27	24 12 8 29 25 34 33 13 2 7 27	I could lay on a boat all day.
27	17 24 14 32 3 28 19 5 2 8 27	Ugh, this map is so un-colorful. I would rather use my phone to search for a place.
27	28 11 17 4 33 29 35 8 7 6 27	This is a day I would sleep in.
27	3 10 20 26 12 17 22 16 4 7 27	The city has dull people
27	26 35 28 19 10 14 29 16 6 18 27	I haven't gotten up to throw this away yet
27	2 19 6 29 7 21 22 34 35 23 27	Idlesse, Inaction, careless, lentitude, tired
27	31 15 14 33 25 12 13 20 34 17 27	Comic con is cool, but I'd rather look at updates about it on my phone than actually attend the event.
27	30 16 7 5 32 6 24 19 26 25 27	Navigating through a city often feels like a chore.
27	1 6 13 3 8 19 34 7 28 9 27	I tried to shop at this store, but they would't find all my items for me, how bizarre is that?
27	10 32 26 7 29 4 5 1 31 35 27	A road to take a slow stroll down
27	14 15 7 33 19 31 20 35 4 18 27	What is really going on here?
27	11 29 34 17 10 35 30 14 28 16 27	Outside in the snow? Have fun, buddy, I'll be in here sipping my coffee.
27	35 24 21 22 19 32 2 34 13 11 27	I wouldn't even bother moving all day if I had this view.
27	34 11 9 10 15 24 35 31 3 18 27	I find the bike in active today
27	34 3 30 21 32 23 29 25 13 9 27	These would be best dried and preserved.
27	13 21 7 12 8 30 32 23 9 25 27	Oh what a nice spot to relax.
27	14 16 20 6 4 29 10 33 3 8 27	This color makes me want to sleep.
27	6 17 23 2 24 10 14 11 31 16 27	I never get to take pictures like this because I never go outside.,
27	12 3 30 5 14 9 17 24 11 6 27	What an interesting reunion picture.
27	14 9 33 35 2 7 23 22 19 6 27	Oh what a strange car.
27	8 21 34 18 29 25 22 19 26 31 27	is there any food in there
27	7 13 6 24 15 1 2 17 5 14 27	I hate going outside into the city.
27	35 11 14 5 24 21 1 19 3 15 27	I'll just wave hello to every one from here.
27	22 15 14 31 21 29 34 20 2 1 27	Well this is a heap of metal. Why would anyone waste their time fixing this?
27	4 19 23 22 6 35 17 30 31 16 27	yup two guys hanging out.
27	21 35 23 28 13 10 15 11 24 17 27	I would not be out riding like this when I could be in bed.
27	11 5 21 12 16 29 19 14 15 1 27	I'm not going to take the time to read that article.
27	24 32 2 9 11 30 4 34 26 13 27	Ever heard about snail's pace? Yes, the train seem to ride at just that.
27	21 16 30 6 32 29 11 10 28 2 27	My vision is so blurry but I can't be bothered to find my glasses.
27	33 1 29 5 14 19 18 22 31 16 27	Just couldn't go get it yourself.
27	28 4 30 34 6 25 20 33 2 23 27	Sitting and watching tv all day every day.
27	1 25 24 32 35 17 31 21 14 22 27	Wish I had the energy to go to the concert.
27	11 3 23 31 9 24 29 21 7 35 27	I think the kid wants to be carried
27	31 13 10 3 5 15 11 7 1 16 27	They don't look like the most comfortable rocks, but I could probably get a nap out of it.
27	4 30 29 34 26 13 20 33 14 6 27	I'm too lazy to walk the rest of the way.
27	20 22 17 1 28 21 19 3 24 15 27	i couldn't get off the couch for this show
27	29 34 3 30 9 19 12 1 8 22 27	i saw a bird too but i didn't feel like taking a picture.
27	34 31 16 22 35 30 20 15 32 2 27	Lets move the ladders tomorrow instead
27	32 23 6 30 11 10 26 22 35 25 27	I would soak myself in the bathtub  and lay there while i sip my wine
27	17 35 21 8 4 28 13 3 30 10 27	Is that like a car or something?
27	24 31 26 25 10 28 6 19 23 2 27	Is that like the sun or the moon?
27	23 28 17 4 26 31 3 6 19 20 27	I really wish uber could somehow airlift me to were I am trying to walk.
27	32 34 22 29 18 13 35 5 15 19 27	I wish I could take a nap on these chairs.
27	9 35 20 11 23 5 24 7 12 25 27	I will leave this mess for the next shift.
27	20 11 34 19 12 4 21 35 30 7 27	There is no way I would hike up that mountain.
27	26 16 24 32 13 28 29 5 30 10 27	hey now. i am typing this comment from the floor. #relatable
27	10 28 29 16 3 4 6 34 24 12 27	great vacation pic, but how long did you spend adding that filter?
27	6 8 32 3 7 2 34 15 18 13 27	I'd pick this flower, but I dont feel like it.
27	19 7 9 1 10 8 16 5 29 28 27	This is me every weekend.
27	33 2 13 28 17 12 10 34 35 23 27	The office needs a couch instead of uncomfy chairs.
27	19 33 23 11 16 7 13 3 9 10 27	I would never in a million years do this.
27	1 24 2 33 12 5 29 16 10 28 27	I wouldnt be able to walk more than an inch in the desert
27	34 8 19 12 3 7 23 30 21 17 27	I wouldn't wanna even bother these people.
27	9 35 12 15 21 25 19 30 5 33 27	Can you count how many people are in the picture, im tired
27	31 35 20 19 30 15 16 9 14 34 27	I would rather take a car than walk across this bridge.
27	26 6 21 13 17 33 31 24 9 11 27	Goodness, it took so long to walk up here. Wasn't even worth it.
27	8 25 12 7 14 3 24 5 17 26 27	Jeez, I would've hated putting that up.
27	17 33 7 1 9 3 4 19 35 16 27	That's too heavy to deal with.
27	13 29 18 24 34 28 11 1 22 15 27	I wish I could go to sleep on that couch.
27	18 21 31 20 2 4 25 7 19 23 27	I would never want to climb that high.
27	17 4 33 20 9 18 19 29 1 21 27	I am going to climb into the boat, push off shore, and sleep the day away.
27	23 33 24 3 2 34 4 22 20 25 27	I could sit and stare at flowers all day.\
27	3 26 28 12 30 22 21 6 18 9 27	I am too tired to clip this hair.
27	28 2 14 31 33 30 21 35 15 11 27	Too tired to put in the effort of being a ballerina.
27	7 21 28 35 22 26 10 1 19 31 27	Kid pretending to be Indiana Jones
27	8 16 25 31 19 28 1 33 21 32 27	I would rather watch tv
27	4 8 26 6 29 12 21 3 20 24 27	I wish i could have this car, but it is too much to clean and take good care of it all the time
27	9 4 1 29 19 10 8 22 25 17 27	This color makes me want to nap.
27	9 25 24 13 8 21 33 29 14 28 27	Ugh, can you change the baby's diaper? I cannot change anymore!
27	8 12 26 5 6 13 33 28 1 21 27	What a nice place to sit.
27	30 18 11 24 32 6 31 3 5 21 27	This shade of blue makes me want to go to sleep.
27	9 31 24 20 25 26 35 23 16 21 27	Ugh, I don't want to shovel the snow
27	7 25 8 23 4 5 11 24 35 16 27	What I would do to have a life like his! Just floating around on sea currents all day... How dreamy...
27	12 16 7 22 1 25 19 24 8 31 27	Laying on the couch with a dog. Living my dream life.
27	1 16 11 21 20 31 25 26 29 34 27	I never sing or talk to anyone like these people, it's too much work.
27	5 21 2 1 4 8 33 23 28 29 27	I'd rather be at home
27	28 6 32 9 12 20 29 17 7 30 27	I'm feel so tired this days.
27	19 3 16 21 33 26 23 5 2 34 27	I'd like to take a nap on that boat.
27	26 19 5 1 21 25 10 29 32 2 27	The kids in this class look like they don't even want to be there haha.
27	4 25 26 13 19 34 12 3 31 16 27	I'd stay sitting-- standing is too much effort.
27	35 34 30 9 18 8 28 1 5 6 27	The words on the pictures are too small to read.
27	16 7 13 14 17 1 6 15 29 31 27	I'll call an Uber before I drive myself.
27	32 6 33 19 2 1 8 35 22 20 27	This color makes me sleepy.
27	33 26 25 34 11 3 24 13 5 31 27	Can you move my hands for me, I have no energy left.
27	3 7 1 4 31 18 26 2 8 22 27	I could just curl up in one of those cubbies and fall fast asleep!
27	4 9 16 30 6 28 13 22 15 21 27	Someone should probaby clean that up.
27	10 31 21 8 26 25 30 1 13 2 27	In my perfect world, I would be fed by somebody else without having to get up.
27	12 31 22 15 25 24 30 10 8 3 27	I guess I might think about going to this.
27	28 9 17 25 14 15 26 32 8 19 27	Needs to dress a little better.
27	15 22 16 20 2 5 13 4 8 7 27	Wish she'd come over here
27	12 24 18 2 25 33 20 10 26 19 27	I want to go to church sometimes, but it is too far away.
27	12 10 26 11 3 25 16 17 30 20 27	This truck will need to sit here for years.
27	11 18 6 35 5 28 29 2 13 21 27	Looks like a nice place for a walk, if I liked walking
27	30 28 18 21 29 12 13 5 25 15 27	I hope it rains often there because I'm too lazy to go out and water
27	34 14 32 4 30 16 6 5 28 19 27	So we have to go all the way around? No thanks.
27	30 18 4 29 9 25 16 28 33 7 27	I would get tired just standing up there.
27	32 7 8 12 11 30 23 13 35 14 27	Too many walks to have a dog
27	3 21 26 17 34 29 2 5 33 25 27	Ugh.  Walking around. Looks hard.
27	1 14 8 26 31 5 2 21 3 20 27	man that place is across the street, not going there
27	12 8 33 32 14 18 29 2 13 9 27	I was supposed to pain the bricks last week, but nah.
27	7 24 23 14 13 34 17 6 16 9 27	I would hate to navigate through this city every day.
27	5 35 22 2 31 15 17 7 20 12 27	I wouldnt want to do what he has to at that party.
27	7 19 17 26 31 6 25 30 21 10 27	Music concert at the meeting
27	10 30 16 32 13 2 34 26 33 9 27	No way I'm going there, I just want to sit at home all day.
27	28 8 19 6 20 9 4 31 30 3 27	That is just want I want to do...take a nap.
27	11 1 29 18 35 13 32 22 23 9 27	As cool as it would be to go see this, no way I'm leaving my house for that.
27	22 30 16 29 13 9 25 7 19 5 27	I am not cleaning up after these kids. I never do.
27	34 8 22 29 23 10 1 24 11 14 27	These ducks make me want to swim less
27	4 33 35 1 32 26 10 18 12 14 27	A tree and a forest.
27	1 10 5 30 11 12 35 31 29 22 27	I mean it's alright isn't it? But it's not quite the city, can you imagine having to walk around all those fields, you can't even jump on a bus!
27	4 24 19 23 30 3 12 28 18 21 27	i wouldn't be bothered by getting the ball either
27	7 16 24 25 1 35 5 26 30 11 27	i'll work on it tomorrow.
27	20 9 1 24 23 6 26 3 18 14 27	I could never have muscles like that. I don't have the time to work out
27	32 6 15 29 2 7 22 12 34 17 27	That picnic looks like too much work.
27	34 20 2 5 1 12 9 8 7 32 27	Is this like a pie or something?
27	4 19 9 31 11 35 20 16 3 21 27	That roof looks like a bit of a pain to put on. Just stick a flat roof on!
27	28 31 34 16 4 2 20 6 19 26 27	I would go for a walk, but I can't be bothered.
27	24 31 7 17 14 11 21 25 8 18 27	Only one firework for 4th of July, but hey it'll work.
27	30 6 4 29 13 23 8 26 1 14 27	Yeah! Lets sit all day and do nothing!
27	33 19 5 22 30 35 23 6 3 14 27	Ideal morning would be to eat about five of these and then have a nap.
27	32 18 26 4 19 28 14 6 10 21 27	I could never climb to a view like that, trust.
27	1 17 21 4 11 30 22 5 32 10 27	I don't usually feel getting up to open my door when someone knocks.
27	11 9 21 31 30 35 19 34 17 22 27	I didn't feel like putting her hat on
27	24 30 29 2 11 1 22 6 33 26 27	Well down time is necessary too.
27	7 33 23 16 4 30 12 1 5 3 27	Ok private tom, can you pick my gun for me? thank you.
27	22 17 5 11 23 31 32 18 30 21 27	Driving a boat. Thats an easy job.
27	2 18 31 13 4 7 25 14 15 19 27	Why can't you just take a battery lamp?
27	6 35 31 4 10 26 14 20 3 13 27	nice drawing of a pepper.
27	14 2 6 11 12 1 33 20 5 35 27	No idea what it is or what it means.
27	12 24 25 17 13 19 33 14 9 11 27	That guy definitely has the best parking spot.
27	20 6 23 19 25 34 35 24 13 11 27	I'm too tired to untie him. Maybe tomorrow.
27	30 24 3 33 32 5 23 18 13 35 27	Looks like too much work to ride
27	29 17 7 24 23 34 28 33 5 1 27	Get me a beer and a couch and im set
27	33 4 23 13 32 2 8 16 3 6 27	I was thinking about getting up and going to the store, but...Nah.
27	16 31 13 11 35 20 33 17 28 34 27	Too much work to get a personal plate
27	30 29 9 1 22 32 14 6 11 10 27	The ceiling is way to high.  I would never clean it.
27	7 9 11 15 6 5 32 19 16 31 27	GOD! Why the heck would I ever even go to this store it's so HARD and you know talking to these people would take so much WORK.
27	8 34 12 16 6 14 26 3 4 18 27	Ok, someone else get up and give my part.
27	23 5 2 3 32 16 18 22 6 35 27	Too much decorating, too much worj
27	22 21 28 7 10 20 19 23 31 29 27	you can never win if you never fini...
27	3 30 29 23 32 16 22 15 26 17 27	I really do not want to have to wash this cup and saucer, I want to relax.
27	18 9 13 2 6 14 31 30 21 3 27	I wish I had my own personal limo so I'd never have to drive.
27	8 32 26 2 7 1 21 23 28 30 27	I just feel like sitting in that shade
27	31 35 9 33 4 11 25 18 32 10 27	If I knew what these meant I wouldn't even bother to work it out.
27	24 31 8 30 21 4 32 34 12 5 27	Im glad i dont have to cook
27	2 29 12 32 19 16 6 26 5 21 27	I'd never climb this high. But I like looking at it from my couch.
27	3 33 25 11 24 12 28 19 34 2 27	This looks like a good spot to lie around and do nothing.
28	1 19 20 12 33 35 29 34 25 11 28	A gathering of the cowboy witches. All the elements are represented here, Earth, Wind, Fire and Water. Are we ready to begin with our meditation?
28	18 21 4 24 6 8 10 11 7 1 28	I am one with this bicycle, I am one with this bicycle, I am one with this bicycle...
28	30 4 9 21 2 29 26 33 34 31 28	I wonder if she knows demons live there.
28	15 34 29 35 12 25 20 22 21 8 28	This makes me ponder life itself.
28	29 19 9 4 6 20 26 7 31 10 28	The purple haze reminds me of a life force !
28	3 4 26 17 11 22 33 32 31 23 28	Isn't it amazing how everything is Coned off, all in separate area and Lanes. It is like driving a maze.
28	24 12 34 6 30 19 13 21 17 31 28	After a deep meditation I havhavee discovered this couple will soon divorce each other over the other's choice of cake for the wedding.
28	35 9 7 10 2 12 24 18 15 3 28	This is one of the best plays ever.
28	9 17 10 13 35 14 8 34 24 25 28	I bet all the kings and queens and armies of the land toiled and jested in this magical valley.
28	5 9 10 4 20 13 7 8 34 24 28	I heard that this house is haunted and no one knows why.
28	30 4 17 12 25 7 10 19 34 5 28	Oh she's deep in thought!
28	1 27 12 15 26 30 4 10 6 35 28	This almost looks like a place to sit and perhaps reflect on nature... very peaceful and remote.
28	30 26 2 7 8 25 13 18 19 9 28	Oh I bet there are all kinds of great stories from this place!
28	34 22 21 29 15 18 32 8 31 23 28	The land out here is just so beautiful.  It's like you're own secluded paradise
28	29 31 4 25 5 19 22 8 2 13 28	I love thinking back to another time
28	23 13 3 11 26 16 30 32 14 25 28	The eye of providence watching over the world
28	32 34 35 21 5 2 33 11 25 19 28	I wonder which wizard or witch lives here.
28	34 25 9 14 7 20 12 1 11 4 28	I wonder what message the painter is trying to convey.
28	32 14 27 25 18 17 15 2 21 10 28	I wonder if this is telling the tale of a man going through demensions.
28	26 7 12 31 4 25 2 3 9 35 28	The trees and leaves fall and grow in the fall.
28	16 5 29 30 19 20 22 32 23 4 28	This food must have came from narnia.
28	25 10 26 18 29 11 24 17 30 33 28	Could be willing that last minute, game winning point!
28	3 4 14 17 30 34 27 24 7 20 28	This would be a magical place to meditate.

29	21 31 8 10 4 20 30 3 18 7 29	Nothing special going on here
29	23 16 27 35 1 32 10 22 34 25 29	Kids playing hockey can be so slow.
29	10 26 32 20 12 7 30 24 21 4 29	This is a racecar, aka deathtrap.
29	30 23 15 7 10 32 13 6 11 20 29	I wish this boring graduation would end so I can go home and watch tv
29	4 7 26 30 9 5 6 19 10 3 29	This looks like a park. A boring park.
29	5 22 17 6 1 33 12 7 13 11 29	I think the cat has a question.
29	26 27 24 9 20 16 10 34 18 2 29	It's a woman holding a postcard in front of a building.
29	9 3 17 10 19 1 7 5 32 8 29	This looks boring, I would rather sleep.
29	30 15 13 9 18 12 32 5 2 28 29	This is an odd and boring town.
29	12 20 27 17 23 4 7 16 26 14 29	Two men, jamming on guitars.
29	31 17 13 26 18 32 7 20 30 33 29	This guy looks like he's not having a good time.
29	32 4 8 2 24 28 12 17 21 6 29	This scene looks hot and sweaty, yuck.
29	3 12 8 17 16 5 33 6 25 10 29	This man is laughing in the woods. It looks like it may be a little cold out.
29	23 6 3 27 14 13 7 32 15 19 29	It would be easier to ride on a sidewalk.
29	1 13 15 19 33 20 18 14 6 27 29	Where you may see trees and fun, its all just the dead leaves being trampled with no hope for a future.
29	23 25 26 19 32 11 28 35 8 14 29	Another product manufactured in China.
29	33 24 2 10 26 1 13 6 17 15 29	That house has very little reflection in the water, but I do see tree reflections.
29	32 24 9 7 25 33 27 5 19 34 29	It's just black and white.
29	21 15 13 5 19 34 27 30 23 11 29	That looks nice I guess
29	9 26 24 23 2 27 18 19 22 13 29	White snow is on the rocks.
29	11 1 32 2 26 7 27 35 34 30 29	Not sure what the fuss is all about.
29	15 34 4 19 27 33 11 14 24 6 29	Lots of green out there.
29	6 25 33 22 21 5 12 9 31 11 29	Alot of elephants looks very similar to each other. Even when they are babies.
29	22 28 13 21 6 34 1 8 2 25 29	I could smell the flowers. I could see the flowers. But they were just flowers--boring.
29	34 16 21 27 12 35 3 33 15 19 29	*Wants new phone* but old phone wont break. #nokia
29	18 8 25 32 20 14 21 30 6 34 29	the colors of the wall and courtyard are very boring
29	32 27 20 33 3 5 24 22 25 2 29	People driving cars on the street.
29	23 35 21 19 25 7 18 15 16 28 29	She is eating ice cream.
29	35 23 31 10 28 11 15 33 3 9 29	I like the postures with these guys.
29	26 15 13 23 30 19 14 32 34 12 29	selfies these days are very boring as everyone one post them selves with same pose
29	24 25 14 1 10 20 9 23 28 8 29	I don't think I would have a picnic there.
29	11 26 3 34 13 35 17 24 2 31 29	A typical day in the park.
29	7 30 6 13 21 4 23 19 5 9 29	Photo one of 12,500 in the Everyday People Archive.
29	33 4 35 3 25 2 12 28 32 19 29	This is a picture from our trip last week.
29	9 13 2 28 26 22 3 21 15 17 29	Another exciting night at home watching tv.
29	4 30 15 20 10 2 31 23 24 11 29	I know these veterans are waiting for someone to come home, but so is everyone; not much to see here in my opinion.
29	3 35 11 2 28 16 15 4 33 32 29	Such a boring looking camera.
29	3 33 14 5 34 7 24 20 19 12 29	Another day on the coast.
29	7 25 31 18 27 33 23 28 6 9 29	That helmet is not needed as it makes you uncool.
29	20 3 13 19 4 34 22 23 14 30 29	All I see is a bunch of grey and concrete.
29	27 28 13 18 9 20 4 22 19 26 29	You fold the box back up and it makes a cube.
29	24 6 15 9 16 5 3 23 14 21 29	This hand is giving the thumbs up. Good times.
29	17 10 33 11 21 8 32 19 35 23 29	There is nothing to do.
29	27 23 26 28 32 22 3 13 20 2 29	They have a picturesque artistic through way for a photo, but they just don't know how to make use of it.
29	31 30 12 33 8 5 14 34 3 16 29	WHy does the sun even come out any m ore.
29	21 26 30 20 14 12 10 28 7 27 29	Looks like an old equipment thats not usable.
29	12 15 26 19 22 28 23 35 31 11 29	I like my tea lukewarm thats my favorite. Tea all tastes the same to me.
29	15 12 26 21 10 7 11 27 25 34 29	Strange to wear shades in the shade. Oh, well.
29	17 21 16 28 19 24 1 11 31 25 29	This girl is playing the drum.
29	31 32 9 34 26 11 12 4 18 6 29	Ugh I abhor the beach.
29	11 10 13 8 19 24 20 7 30 3 29	Watching this show is not as entertaining as I remember it being before.
29	26 19 20 21 32 31 28 12 18 33 29	Ugh, not sure why anyone uses an umbrella in the sun.
29	32 16 14 31 23 28 1 20 30 4 29	Rather odd place to paste this.
29	18 16 12 20 30 21 31 5 33 4 29	You couldn't pay me to act this way
29	9 31 32 5 13 1 30 27 3 19 29	I think he's ready to go now.
29	35 33 21 19 8 6 31 27 16 5 29	The square is not so busy
29	5 34 14 25 7 15 27 1 30 6 29	This guy looks like he's bored out of his mind.
29	35 34 25 22 7 11 23 19 8 26 29	Is it nap time yet?
29	21 13 8 4 14 12 28 33 25 24 29	These probably aren't even real.
29	6 33 9 26 27 30 34 14 16 1 29	Whenever I see a crownd doing the wave, I know that I am in the wrong crowd.
29	32 31 16 20 7 18 33 1 14 22 29	I like to color palette they chose and to keep it simple, no muss no fuss.
29	2 22 15 1 12 25 26 20 11 3 29	A bird sits on a tree branch.
29	34 16 27 17 5 22 25 4 20 3 29	Nothing exciting goes on here.
29	19 35 30 23 16 14 24 17 27 31 29	I would get in a boat and float for twenty minutes then head back home to the city honestly.
29	31 23 20 13 11 5 2 30 7 25 29	The paint is peeling and needs fixed.
29	25 35 34 24 8 9 23 15 18 16 29	The girl thinks she is funny.
29	18 20 19 13 2 28 9 33 21 24 29	There is snow on the bikes.
29	3 1 32 8 19 33 30 24 25 11 29	This is a picture of a wall and a window.
29	7 20 13 26 22 21 6 27 24 17 29	That is a big dog.
29	31 3 23 21 1 10 7 2 11 26 29	I would like to try cycling, but I don't want to step out of my comfort zone
29	23 26 31 12 2 30 14 28 15 32 29	This is a lame temple.
29	32 22 6 12 15 17 19 25 33 27 29	Class is such a boring time sometimes.
29	10 30 19 15 27 6 12 11 16 4 29	I never really see much happen in this town.
29	7 14 17 23 31 32 20 35 26 3 29	The flower looks really bored.
29	19 32 33 25 1 31 18 12 34 17 29	Why is there a head on the floor?
29	17 5 16 7 33 21 25 26 28 8 29	My wife, and my kids.
29	16 7 24 26 20 31 9 23 14 4 29	Blue is an okay color for a shirt
29	35 11 21 6 33 7 9 10 31 3 29	Just another day hanging out with the same people.
29	30 9 25 23 18 10 16 24 26 21 29	What is she doing? I'm so bored all the time that I would be willing to do it too.
29	35 4 34 28 21 6 25 31 1 32 29	A pretty drab balding if you asked me.
29	31 12 21 28 6 13 19 11 24 30 29	Oh boy... another boring science experiment.
29	19 30 14 8 9 21 34 1 17 11 29	Birds are uninteresting because they have nothing to do with actuarial tables and tepid conversation.
29	10 33 20 19 24 35 26 23 4 3 29	the wall brought not a bit of attraction to anyone
29	30 31 10 23 15 27 22 25 7 11 29	Black. The most interesting color.
29	20 13 25 19 35 26 15 8 21 27 29	Once you've seen on place, you've seen them all.
29	7 12 28 23 32 34 21 25 13 3 29	I see this tree as boring.
29	8 28 1 23 27 26 30 24 31 13 29	Such an old structure, would it be of any significance?
29	30 19 31 17 26 15 6 23 11 14 29	What a boring photo of tall grass and a tower.
29	21 3 20 27 30 7 33 8 17 31 29	if saw this pictures it will make happy mood
29	4 35 34 10 9 28 20 17 31 27 29	I think that's called "mauve"... dunno though.
29	5 35 25 13 32 22 30 8 19 9 29	Grey logs and brown dirt make lovely scenery
29	3 2 12 11 4 22 18 28 24 31 29	Not want i would love to read,boring!
29	14 19 30 24 6 28 12 21 10 20 29	i bet this guy could put you to sleep
29	27 23 11 17 3 30 19 32 35 22 29	This is a boring picture as far as I can tell.
29	24 34 28 13 16 25 1 30 11 21 29	Yep, another plain old building.
29	21 34 11 23 3 31 27 22 19 32 29	I could look at this sign for hours.
29	24 32 21 13 11 4 26 20 30 34 29	I like the beach sometimes.
29	1 24 6 21 11 32 13 23 15 2 29	There's an owl, and some cactus, and some dirt. Hmm.
29	16 15 34 21 18 6 14 13 22 5 29	I am looking up there.
29	10 4 23 32 30 16 21 28 19 26 29	there is nothing special about a hand
29	7 27 2 25 35 30 32 17 4 15 29	I don't see you improving much.
29	30 2 11 10 27 31 16 21 35 17 29	What a boring, empty street.
29	31 4 6 8 30 34 35 15 22 18 29	It is not so bright but shows the true nature of art
29	35 10 15 16 2 13 21 26 9 20 29	They are just standing around in white pjs
29	32 18 23 4 11 12 10 22 2 14 29	I like the color green.
29	30 25 23 21 2 19 12 14 33 1 29	This would be sad during the winter.
29	22 21 13 10 1 5 2 3 9 27 29	It's just a bird feeder.
29	15 31 6 12 24 11 9 18 7 28 29	the little boy is ready to play but his friend did not come.
29	6 34 26 27 7 11 9 23 20 21 29	OK I can tell that she's involved in the guitar craft
29	3 17 25 7 10 26 30 5 20 13 29	Study hall is so boring.
29	6 21 13 24 23 35 27 34 3 25 29	I guess that looks like a pretty decent meal.
29	12 2 21 32 26 17 28 34 25 13 29	Lime green is too stimulating I need something much more beige.
29	34 9 33 4 7 17 6 18 12 35 29	This post is brought to you by the letter A.
29	35 22 8 26 16 5 18 9 6 11 29	Not much going on here.
29	33 26 35 32 21 27 14 5 28 1 29	I don't get why I'm looking at a squash or lemon.
29	17 28 5 30 3 33 20 34 24 7 29	There are some green hills and a body of water.
29	7 32 30 25 6 19 13 26 31 33 29	They look bored to death.
30	22 3 21 23 5 1 4 14 7 26 30	He stares at his opponent dead in the eyes and says, "I've got you."
30	32 1 12 28 22 7 13 19 29 25 30	Be wary, my friends! This photo has no scale and I am the one who designed the scale MODEL flowers in the lower left corner. Quite the photo, props for the lighting!
30	13 25 11 32 16 7 2 15 9 8 30	The sky today was magnificent!
30	26 31 24 12 28 23 13 16 29 20 30	The street lights are very nice and bright. Makes the city feel more safe.
30	13 9 15 34 35 14 6 8 17 5 30	The technique used by the photographer to take this photo is rivaled by none.  He is genius
30	28 15 35 29 10 31 34 32 13 24 30	Because of the waterfall in the background the water was extremely clear as it was always moving.
30	32 35 15 9 25 7 6 13 34 16 30	The player in the helmet is wearing realyl cool Ninja Turle tights.
30	9 28 26 14 24 17 23 15 25 29 30	I know exactly how to get that car out of there.
30	24 29 32 12 8 18 11 26 2 34 30	Fabulous capture of this moment.
30	1 32 11 5 34 28 22 18 10 20 30	These ladies are definitely having a nice time.
30	5 26 3 4 23 22 31 7 11 10 30	Basketball, the sport of champions.
30	5 21 22 13 7 23 26 27 31 12 30	What a lovely skyline, it powers the city.
30	14 9 25 11 29 15 21 4 5 26 30	Ah, look at how society is improving. People are enjoying a live singer with possible good messages to deliver to those that can hear them.
30	34 17 23 21 3 25 24 15 18 28 30	This looks like an ad for anonymous.
30	22 18 4 5 6 24 19 10 11 27 30	The car is so smart
30	18 14 24 11 26 9 32 10 16 25 30	Wow this view is almost as brilliant as I am
30	31 25 22 24 5 27 14 9 21 1 30	A true snapshot from the past.
30	1 29 31 7 22 33 17 3 10 21 30	What inviting colors for a place of learning.
30	21 12 17 8 9 28 1 16 18 23 30	I built that bucket with my barehands and nothing more than a toothbrush and some yarn.
30	13 5 27 28 3 23 11 1 22 12 30	This statue is one of the most elegant i've seen.
30	2 24 28 17 29 18 4 23 14 25 30	I had never seen such an innovative person with primitive resouces.
30	20 15 18 31 28 34 10 9 17 29 30	The dominos game is played by many
30	28 24 4 8 9 27 29 6 1 12 30	Looks like the guy is crying over his awesomeness.
30	8 33 3 20 32 23 25 21 1 10 30	This lighthouse is a wondrous shade of red.
30	5 13 17 33 27 9 34 8 16 28 30	The snow is filled with footprints
30	12 11 7 22 25 8 5 16 26 1 30	Thoughtful design, it really compliments the structure.
30	33 8 9 3 29 1 23 22 13 20 30	This plane will fly through the air at speeds of alot.
30	21 22 15 14 35 17 12 25 10 2 30	The stark contrast makes a compelling feature to this photograph.
30	4 3 34 12 18 5 23 11 20 29 30	Being part of a masterful event means you are important.
30	4 3 22 11 18 32 35 6 26 25 30	Their sport outfit is bright and colorful.
30	18 20 8 7 17 19 1 3 22 24 30	What a brilliant day, and just the perfect lane for skiing.
30	9 35 23 15 31 12 27 2 3 29 30	This person is part of a larger band
30	5 18 19 25 28 3 34 15 6 11 30	The lighting here make great effects for the mood
30	1 33 3 31 17 28 19 9 7 15 30	The darnkess of the color black is never overshadowed.
30	12 13 32 4 8 11 35 29 19 2 30	The architectural structure of that bridge is masterful.
30	14 4 5 21 3 23 24 16 31 26 30	The quality of these dancers is magnificent.
30	27 9 15 10 25 11 8 24 12 26 30	I would hire this trio sing at my wedding.
30	20 8 28 14 10 4 35 31 23 24 30	This could actually be a symbol of people having to climb the ladder of life rung by rung, fighting each other to the top.
30	2 11 31 14 16 32 3 24 35 21 30	It is less expensive to share a guitar.
30	21 5 6 11 9 17 20 29 19 35 30	Christmas with family is the best of it all!
30	31 27 35 7 6 4 3 1 16 25 30	there is a microscopic surface that these can balance on
30	24 14 27 19 28 1 8 7 29 20 30	This was built, they think, in 1516
30	9 31 19 2 13 14 11 3 17 25 30	He is definitely at the head of his pack
30	29 18 13 23 2 33 27 9 21 26 30	a great effort by these people, I hope they raise a lot of money
30	34 23 5 33 7 3 9 6 8 29 30	This memorial is one the most visited in the country.
30	5 32 3 34 10 14 16 31 6 21 30	Talent is born from within.
30	23 34 7 24 27 14 29 6 2 12 30	This is the food chain is real time.
30	22 33 5 15 10 1 28 27 34 8 30	You should never grab the lowest hanging fruit.
30	3 33 8 24 13 4 32 12 28 7 30	What an outstanding and peaceful looking skyline.
30	12 18 31 29 20 26 4 6 10 27 30	The ocean is awe-inspiring, quite brilliant.
30	10 2 3 34 14 15 6 35 20 25 30	from the shadow patterns and the tree condition, this is between January 21st to 26th.
30	16 13 8 21 33 26 17 20 6 22 30	Ha. I guess I see where "cat nap" came from.
30	15 10 1 2 12 31 17 20 3 29 30	The lines of this piece of graffiti are geometrically aesthetically pleasing.

30	16 5 3 18 2 15 23 25 9 28 30	Art enthusiast, take note. The landscape portrayed here is the needle hidden in the proverbial haystack commonly referred to as "natural beauty". The trees, with their thin trunks and luscious branches gives way to lively forest that sites under the overcast sky. The sun, while absent, is ever present within the calm waters. The grass is not well-maintained, leading onlookers to feel personally connected. "This landscape is breathtaking, but I deserve it." Captivating.

30	7 10 4 35 22 34 9 6 3 15 30	I think this photo needs a little more, no less, people. Nay, NO people!
30	9 21 14 12 2 10 6 8 28 4 30	Notice the transition between the snow and the grass.

30	24 4 35 19 14 34 26 31 18 5 30	What an artistic perspective, the reflection in the door knob.
30	20 28 9 14 23 31 21 34 11 27 30	The contrast between light and dark in this room makes this picture pop
30	19 7 11 27 23 10 24 21 12 33 30	Using an old Aztec fishing technique..if done properly yields 50% more catch than average commercial boat!

31	11 19 35 7 16 32 6 12 27 20 31	It's sad to think about the barbaric slaughter of the cows that are made into these burgers. We need to be kinder to the animals on this planet.

31	33 12 20 29 35 14 32 9 17 11 31	He looks scared, poor thing.
31	2 1 15 13 16 7 5 24 17 11 31	Beautiful girl in a beautiful spot.

31	10 25 28 2 8 3 13 14 17 9 31	I would like to lay down a sleeping bag and stare up at the sky all night. I bet there is such a splendid view there without any light pollution

32	6 12 35 21 31 24 20 25 11 10 32	I remember the days of running through these fields to catch the runaway cows.  Now the operation is so successful we just own this land.

33	31 16 10 11 8 35 12 24 34 30 33	The little boy is thinking about something deeply. The person whose carrying him could be a long haired man or a woman. I hope he is going to bible camp.
33	22 7 1 32 12 3 23 10 19 24 33	I can't believe that kids are forced to stay at their desks like that... children have so much energy to be forced to stay in school all day.

34	3 15 14 26 13 30 24 2 35 23 34	This looks like too many veggies, gross.
34	21 28 2 26 29 18 15 20 33 7 34	Awwww! The cat is so silly!
34	26 16 10 23 28 21 25 3 19 31 34	That guy in the forefront is so upset cause his friend was given more wine in his glass than he was and that's just not fair!
34	29 35 16 3 19 17 31 22 14 9 34	Tattoos are silly, nice job lady!
34	24 22 25 27 35 31 10 15 7 1 34	I wonder if they have signs to hold up.
34	29 22 2 12 16 27 35 15 18 33 34	Oh wow it looks like there's a blimp or something in the sky!
34	9 22 12 24 8 2 31 17 3 26 34	I just wish I could forget all my problems and have a picnic in the park with my mom

34	9 21 29 31 11 26 13 22 15 6 34	I want to skate down these stairs.
34	6 16 3 27 31 5 24 23 29 12 34	I would steal that sign and keep it in my room!
34	21 11 4 1 8 7 35 25 3 27 34	I wonder if anyone back-washed into that water.
34	2 3 35 25 12 5 6 8 31 23 34	I don't know where her hair ends and her hat begins!
34	24 2 12 29 28 23 26 14 13 20 34	My roommate keeps eating my leftovers so I took all of his stuff.
34	22 15 23 3 18 6 10 13 32 26 34	I want to climb that tower.
34	4 11 16 21 14 25 30 7 18 15 34	Why can't I wear just a diaper to swim?
34	35 18 26 15 33 6 17 3 24 31 34	I would be scared to be talking and would imagine the audience in their underwear.
34	17 9 5 2 29 20 23 19 33 6 34	Baby girl curls! How precious!
34	21 16 11 14 33 26 19 29 32 15 34	What are they all looking at?
34	8 9 2 24 23 26 28 7 18 20 34	i wish they fell in
34	15 5 20 26 22 31 35 12 17 14 34	I want to build a choo-choo train around this.
34	23 16 19 24 22 6 35 18 29 9 34	The bullets go bang bang.
34	33 22 15 28 30 17 6 2 20 31 34	Oh he looks little like me!
34	22 1 6 8 32 15 16 28 3 17 34	Look im holding this big boulder
34	5 11 10 25 26 23 8 13 29 27 34	These kids could never be in mission control
34	26 31 15 30 35 5 22 17 16 7 34	The animals are really cool
34	31 14 1 22 8 16 7 6 4 21 34	I wanna play pretend bride!
34	30 9 31 18 10 26 14 21 25 27 34	This looks like a scene out of Moana!
34	14 15 6 11 8 2 25 5 12 7 34	I remember the time I went skiing in my backyard.
34	28 19 27 24 6 11 30 17 7 32 34	Hey look up in the sky! It's a bird, it's a plane, no it's Big Bird from Sesame Street!
34	26 25 12 20 21 28 33 17 23 11 34	Maybe if she weren't arching her back she'd look mroe natural.
34	25 12 10 4 31 5 23 1 27 28 34	ooh can we play with the pretty bug
34	15 11 26 19 12 5 18 32 22 24 34	Dare you to ask if their house is number 4?
34	8 26 13 30 31 27 14 32 5 22 34	I feel like playing hide and seek in this crowded arena.
34	21 15 35 10 17 8 26 6 4 5 34	Let's climb to the top and sing
34	26 9 20 8 7 12 29 10 18 3 34	what a weird picture, why would you take this?
34	9 20 23 11 33 10 16 5 8 14 34	This is the way Little Red Riding Hood went to Grandma's house, huh?
34	29 2 4 14 18 35 1 13 17 26 34	I can't read this language, this is pointless to me.
34	4 33 7 13 1 11 5 9 27 16 34	they look like Peter Pan yeah
34	19 5 17 1 13 3 25 35 24 28 34	It's not fair he gets all the attention.  My birthday was yesterday, but nobody gave me anything.
34	33 11 19 29 21 16 28 32 18 17 34	The heck is that? I can't read that!
34	32 5 3 10 19 27 8 13 11 2 34	Who wants to get up and dance until the sunrise?
34	12 28 24 27 26 22 21 20 4 7 34	Now Becky, I've told you several times now that you can't have my parking space just because your car is more expensive!
34	24 28 5 33 15 4 9 8 14 7 34	A park is for kids for life!
34	26 31 5 21 25 13 17 19 2 18 34	Kids'll have fun where they want.
34	1 16 3 25 29 8 35 32 22 27 34	This color makes me want to play!
34	5 15 22 31 9 27 11 21 17 33 34	Another soccer match. of course my child is better than the rest on the field, they cant stop my #1 star!
34	23 11 9 4 32 13 17 25 16 10 34	I bet one of these people farted.
34	4 1 28 20 23 5 29 32 35 31 34	I want a toy from the store
34	35 7 1 27 16 5 20 13 30 4 34	That is considered a snack in some countries
34	27 19 26 5 11 12 22 33 21 6 34	That old guy has so much acne his wife looks like his mom.
34	21 10 16 18 12 35 23 17 22 24 34	HAhaha! That drawing looks stupid!
34	28 6 11 21 25 12 30 13 8 16 34	Eww, they're going to kiss.
34	24 30 17 31 3 18 14 12 22 26 34	Hugs from this dad puts smiles on their faces :)
34	7 13 30 23 29 3 18 19 10 25 34	I play lots of games on my ipad
34	23 32 6 8 16 2 28 7 4 20 34	Skateboarding there would be awesome.
34	11 17 21 33 14 35 25 8 31 10 34	This reminds me when I use to run up and down the subway as a child. I still do it sometimes...but only late at night when no one is there.
34	20 30 35 6 8 26 27 16 19 5 34	My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty!
34	23 10 13 29 15 7 9 30 16 4 34	Well that plan seems complex.
34	24 35 15 22 28 10 7 4 16 3 34	Her nose makes her look dorky.
34	2 15 30 14 19 18 32 1 31 5 34	Let's do the hokey pokey!
34	35 32 19 2 14 16 24 25 4 26 34	Anybody else want to run in their with a basket of water balloons?
34	29 31 25 5 20 18 12 27 15 10 34	I like flowers and trees
34	25 14 21 23 33 27 2 5 26 9 34	I want to play games with her!
34	31 27 17 28 10 2 7 8 19 29 34	The beauty salon won't be very beautiful after I make a mess inside of it.
34	2 28 7 16 20 35 30 32 10 6 34	Look at this silly little dog why does he sleep with signs on his face all day ha ha ha.
34	10 6 30 27 19 12 18 14 17 22 34	Haha what losers sitting on the steps.
34	17 26 31 9 16 25 1 6 15 10 34	I think they are miners.
34	33 30 27 3 12 16 17 2 23 22 34	She needs to get out of the way I'm trying to look at the seal.
34	20 14 9 28 2 19 12 3 25 27 34	That lady is gonna puke if he keeps sticking fingers down there.
34	31 12 15 25 30 35 9 14 3 8 34	Watch out for poop below!
34	15 9 21 26 33 14 2 1 24 35 34	Hahaha those girls r cuties
34	18 30 14 31 16 33 28 1 11 12 34	I want to play. Why cant I play with them?
34	14 35 17 33 26 25 7 27 5 18 34	Hey, can you give me a hand? Hahah
34	23 22 7 2 13 29 11 21 9 35 34	I don't think I'd want to share the car with my stupid brother, either.
34	3 15 32 9 27 8 11 14 13 12 34	Wow all guys, that place looks like a sausage fest!
34	7 4 5 14 33 3 16 27 11 15 34	I would love to find these laying in the grass and eat them.
34	13 30 10 26 8 21 9 24 12 5 34	This definitely looks like a party from when I was a kid
34	3 14 33 2 10 6 17 16 13 18 34	I was here once, it got so loud that I started stomping my feet and almost cried.
34	27 20 29 2 13 33 15 7 6 21 34	Go jump in the water!!
34	5 28 17 18 21 32 26 22 15 8 34	This would be perfect if there were snowmen everywhere.
34	6 30 15 29 23 21 18 32 11 31 34	I just want to run up and down those stairs!
34	14 18 23 6 13 15 35 11 20 31 34	If I was there, I'd totally prank the heck outta them!
34	8 2 15 32 11 27 13 6 20 23 34	I love stealing the soap and stuff from the hotel room, what are they gonna do about it!?
34	32 15 3 27 19 18 4 16 20 31 34	Those pillars are so long and hard... that's what she said! Haha!
34	16 3 20 28 31 17 26 7 6 30 34	Trut me. He was the flyest kid in class that day.
34	10 2 4 33 11 24 25 27 28 1 34	These would be great people to play with.
34	29 27 22 30 23 32 21 9 13 20 34	A kid must have shaved this animal!
34	10 24 16 3 2 14 28 29 27 5 34	The pattern looks like the tiles in my grandma's bathroom.
34	32 3 13 25 23 7 26 8 21 4 34	This looks like a door to a fairy tale world!
34	11 28 33 6 8 7 25 2 30 3 34	is it me , or is this pic side ways ? i cant tell. someone tell me.
34	6 35 2 12 9 4 7 14 1 5 34	Gosh, I would get lost in a city that big!
34	7 5 22 11 25 32 1 3 28 4 34	That is some beautiful grass. I would love to roll around in it.
34	27 23 16 5 26 28 29 11 35 22 34	I could do better and don't like this.
34	30 4 5 8 9 6 7 31 12 24 34	I bet elves live in these woods.
34	20 26 18 3 14 21 1 13 28 23 34	Look at those dumb knifes. LOL.
34	1 25 21 19 23 33 35 6 29 27 34	Is this an id card?
34	1 35 4 21 8 18 24 29 3 11 34	Those are such pretty colors!
34	23 12 16 29 8 13 11 24 35 1 34	Hold your strings you bog babies.
34	24 27 2 1 22 18 3 26 29 13 34	I like red and even blue, but never purple!
34	11 12 20 22 32 6 16 15 23 7 34	Look at that really big, really fast airplane!
34	9 33 26 2 28 20 10 4 16 35 34	look at her bulky teeth sticking out when she smiles, wheres her bottom roq?
34	11 1 35 26 20 4 6 16 29 25 34	This house has a lot of weird pictures.
34	8 17 1 9 24 28 29 19 20 15 34	That would be fun to pretend its a pair of binoculars.
34	30 4 28 3 14 9 10 13 29 15 34	This looks like a super fun ramp that we can slide right down.
34	12 20 16 31 17 22 26 24 5 29 34	all alone in a rock at a pine forest.. how unappealing
34	5 13 17 9 20 12 3 21 22 11 34	Woah, I could totally skateboard around these stores!
34	7 1 9 11 29 28 10 18 24 4 34	I wanna go swim in there!
34	11 19 20 28 1 14 31 25 7 24 34	I want to get out on the field and play too!
34	4 24 22 27 11 23 12 6 1 10 34	She doesn't even look up for the camera.
34	31 9 35 16 5 11 30 14 26 18 34	You could splash if you fell off!
34	19 27 20 24 4 9 5 32 3 29 34	There isn't enough snow for a snowman!
34	7 28 13 32 27 18 29 24 21 4 34	Wow the woman looks way older than the man. Probably illegal for them to date.
34	11 9 33 7 8 26 6 17 3 2 34	Let's swim all summer vacation long
34	31 14 17 30 22 29 16 18 21 11 34	This looks like my robot best friend
34	5 23 22 13 4 28 20 8 30 25 34	I wish I could jump right in that water
34	27 21 13 33 17 1 10 18 22 24 34	Look at those stupid buildings. Look like two big wieners tickling the sky.
34	17 15 22 3 14 5 19 9 20 26 34	Awww! So cute! I want a kitty so bad!
34	18 6 22 25 26 21 10 23 35 14 34	Mommy, are sand sharks make of sand?
34	23 29 9 16 33 30 27 21 25 10 34	That green is so dark and yucky.
34	18 29 25 23 21 26 6 17 11 1 34	I want cuddles with that little ball of fur!
34	23 20 5 33 4 14 13 24 12 6 34	Oh I want to take a picture in the car!
34	17 4 8 28 18 11 9 24 35 21 34	What a silly man, he's going to spill it and then he'll be in trouble.
34	28 30 7 8 23 33 10 32 2 29 34	Who knocked over my sign?
35	27 6 20 32 18 22 26 34 10 8 35	This is where I buried my dog,I can't stop crying
35	32 15 6 17 5 18 10 9 21 22 35	I get teary-eyed every time I see this couple together, it's so sweet.
35	15 19 22 27 29 14 30 1 28 9 35	Yuck, he needs a serious hair cut.
35	32 25 19 6 4 3 5 8 9 14 35	This building has so many stories, loves found and lost, births and deaths.  If only it could tell us its stories!
35	24 26 19 14 11 13 27 17 9 5 35	I hope my children get to still experience mother nature as I see it.
35	26 15 29 3 1 34 17 4 19 27 35	It is truly amazing what the human body is capable of.
35	1 31 25 11 22 14 5 7 3 30 35	Losing these native lands must have taken a toll on native americans, it has been sad just learning about it.
35	13 26 4 2 31 34 9 32 8 28 35	Cyprus was the last place I cried :(
35	29 10 8 9 28 3 1 4 7 25 35	Looking at this picture makes me think about living out on my own and having a family started living with me.
35	23 8 21 19 11 10 29 4 27 30 35	Wow, i don't remember the last time i saw a kid in a sandbox :'(
35	34 9 8 30 18 2 20 22 27 23 35	That young couple looks so cute, I really hope they remember this wonderful moment sitting by each other when they're old.
35	33 7 32 25 11 31 22 8 12 18 35	The man can be so sentimental
35	8 18 3 26 16 17 32 10 9 31 35	He's letting it all out now
35	25 13 30 24 4 2 23 6 22 32 35	What a cute little plant, full of life and hope!
35	21 8 13 16 14 6 1 7 19 30 35	This is the last picture taken of this woman before she went missing.  Her family has a full on search going on for her.
35	23 18 7 20 13 31 14 33 1 3 35	So many people in one photo, you just can't see them but you know they're there
35	11 28 21 18 31 32 2 5 8 23 35	What an awesome bike, i'd love that!
35	17 7 16 9 26 21 12 29 10 19 35	Children are so precious, and do not realize they will never have experiences with the same sort of wide-eyed wonder.
35	11 21 31 16 9 28 25 33 7 10 35	This beautiful flower makes me think of lost loves, chances missed.
35	11 25 9 21 16 24 14 2 13 26 35	The swirling forms are like feelings, always going up and down.
35	6 14 15 10 2 31 30 24 11 19 35	This grassy field reminds of one of my great loves, we'd frolic often in green pastures.
35	14 28 6 29 7 16 21 11 30 19 35	Old-fashioned warehouse that needs some love
35	26 33 25 11 16 10 5 17 22 28 35	I'd love to sit here and read.
35	3 22 20 1 16 25 32 29 9 33 35	The photographer's use of special lighting and effects make this photograph into a work of meaningful and thought provoking art.
35	11 1 2 29 18 20 13 8 28 25 35	There's a tear in my beer and my baby is gone she took my dog and I'm all alone.
35	6 24 13 5 16 20 31 12 32 27 35	Oh how they grow so fast!
35	31 26 20 18 22 7 28 3 30 33 35	This family is very close and that is just the best thing
35	6 33 8 31 1 11 20 3 21 24 35	This dish alone makes me long for my hometown like nothing else, brings a tear to my eye.
35	6 33 19 16 1 12 5 34 29 3 35	This woman looks just like my dead sister.
35	11 20 23 17 4 6 25 10 5 19 35	One of the skating classes
35	3 9 34 20 10 17 14 25 31 32 35	Those kids look so entertained, I'm so happy for them.
35	5 24 12 33 21 27 28 32 8 30 35	This looks like such a great effort and I really hope they won with all the hard work they are putting into this.
35	14 18 19 17 20 22 9 5 6 28 35	This sad looking mask reminds me of my dead family.
35	29 15 13 27 26 11 14 7 5 25 35	What a wonderful moment to capture on film. Cherish that feeling!
35	17 9 26 11 32 13 16 15 12 31 35	Man, this brings me back to when I got my first trophy in the championships.
35	9 4 5 25 12 31 8 6 24 10 35	Hanging out with my friends means so much to me, I don't know what I would do without you two...
35	30 11 33 10 8 25 14 28 16 26 35	Eeek! It's a rodent! Get it away from me!
35	7 2 13 30 34 25 28 8 10 5 35	Seeing this meal brought back many memories of my childhood.
35	13 27 21 29 3 34 10 4 19 18 35	OH my this is bringing me to tears
35	6 9 5 34 28 19 20 15 2 8 35	This is where i want my ashes spread when i die.
35	32 11 5 25 27 8 17 21 24 20 35	This man likes to perform, but he also expects great performance and great treatment by the others around him. Be gracious.
35	22 26 27 17 28 4 14 18 25 23 35	So good to see you!
35	30 22 1 16 17 14 23 7 34 9 35	Oh geez all that candy dumping all over makes me so upset.
35	1 34 31 3 33 32 16 15 10 2 35	Those are poisonous so I'll be very sad if anything stumbles upon them and eats them.
35	27 10 15 18 16 23 26 24 14 17 35	Very lovey, brings tears to my eyes
35	13 29 11 4 5 32 1 7 17 14 35	I love my best friend!
35	22 7 23 30 32 33 4 15 5 25 35	Technology has made long strides to better our future.
35	1 5 21 17 27 33 15 16 9 12 35	The are the same bricks that landed on billy and took off his legs!

35	10 20 11 8 18 25 3 13 1 12 35	I long to stay in a historic town like this.  I would cry if it happened.
35	20 5 13 4 10 24 26 21 22 30 35	The Continental Divide is such an important part of US history.
35	13 27 24 19 28 23 12 7 29 10 35	This mural makes me sad.
35	16 15 13 5 14 29 19 33 34 17 35	These zombies have probably already killed off the entire population and now they're coming for me and there is nothing I can do about it
35	2 11 10 20 31 4 25 9 14 6 35	Children are our future, thinking about the uncertainty of the world makes me so sad.
35	18 33 10 17 4 5 16 12 21 29 35	I mean, like, how could he be smiling at a time like this?
35	22 12 10 28 1 20 5 31 25 3 35	I feel overwhelmed by this level of cuteness

35	3 13 16 11 21 17 12 32 26 6 35	This reminds me of all of those we have lost to senseless wars.
35	9 27 34 19 11 25 18 3 21 29 35	She did such a good job that I basically cried.
35	16 19 1 24 30 33 7 29 12 10 35	This looks so sad. All of the tones are dark and give off a lonely vibe.
35	24 16 7 18 29 22 28 23 12 33 35	I wish my "significant other" would give me flowers from time to time
35	14 25 17 20 16 33 28 3 32 29 35	This is my pet and i need him back.
35	16 14 10 32 29 28 6 1 25 17 35	I can feel how powerful the song is from here. Beautiful.
35	23 33 7 20 22 11 15 13 24 2 35	This makes me miss my home back in Minnesota.
35	19 18 6 2 30 28 27 22 15 29 35	How touching and cute is this little bug

35	15 7 19 8 12 31 24 6 14 34 35	This guy looks so sad :(. I hope he gets happier
35	7 3 16 23 24 13 17 2 1 9 35	This building makes me weep.
35	18 11 14 1 19 30 4 33 10 8 35	These fireworks make me so happy
35	23 18 31 19 17 8 30 7 15 9 35	The sea is calm like a sleeping baby.
35	27 30 11 33 34 22 32 26 10 7 35	A beach trip will sooth my woes.
35	13 16 6 15 10 20 17 2 12 21 35	It's so inspiring to see young people playing sports.

35	28 34 11 30 27 33 23 2 5 15 35	That pier looks just like the pier I visited with my dad before he died.
35	12 11 7 30 13 15 34 16 28 10 35	It's so beautiful from the bird's eye.
35	27 9 4 19 25 17 14 10 31 29 35	I cried for hours after realizing I was in the little girls only room.
35	31 6 3 30 17 23 26 19 13 7 35	looks like a fashi model that makes emotional enoough to buy the hat
