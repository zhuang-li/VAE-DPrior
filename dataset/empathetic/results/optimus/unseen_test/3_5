9	17	grateful	surprised	My car had a bat hanging out the back, and I was about to get on the highway. A nice person stopped me and let me know so it wouldn't fly out	The dog ran off the law this morning , and we had toke on the side of the road . We were supposed to check it out and it's not allowed , but it was loud and loud
14	17	lonely	surprised	I have looked everywhere for a mate. I have no luck finding anyone. Perhaps I will be alone for the rest of my life.	I keep a pet . Never have any friends that I have never seen . Coving life with me are one of my best friends .
2	17	proud	surprised	My son is usually very shy. He's really smart and athletic but just doesn't have that gene to make him not shy. But he's had a crush on this girl for awhile and he FINALLY asked her to prom	This is my oldest friend . This is a big boy and he likes to have fun and I love to have fun with him . When I be talking tennis and he is a little silly I kind of wish he was a boy ...
