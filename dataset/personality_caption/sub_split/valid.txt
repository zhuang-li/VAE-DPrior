1	26 24 2 6 25 21 4 28 3 15 1	Everyone needs one of these storage sheds.  Imagine what you could do with one.  It could become a place for adventure! Imagine putting rocks on the side for climbing, or just decorating the inside like a pirate ship for the kids!!!
1	18 4 30 12 20 5 15 16 10 6 1	I wonder if that is snow - If it is that would make a great snowman

1	13 35 24 6 11 29 21 19 5 7 1	I find it so awesome that two people who come from different contexts can be together!
1	4 7 24 18 19 13 35 12 3 25 1	THE TREE REPRESENTS YEARS OF ADVENTURES.
1	32 34 23 27 26 7 3 30 18 28 1	This could be fun if you let it

1	17 7 18 3 34 16 23 22 26 5 1	I'm loving the hats everyone is rocking! Seems like the early morning and they seem to be ready for a big day of exploring, wish I could join.
1	6 9 32 3 13 19 18 7 17 33 1	I would love to go there and set up a tent under the tree and just enjoy nature!
1	35 32 12 19 16 13 31 30 22 11 1	I love doing stuff like this.  Long hikes are my thing!
1	7 25 2 9 16 27 26 4 17 11 1	This is too much fun in one picture
1	16 13 33 31 22 12 10 5 8 2 1	We are about to do something epic
1	19 3 27 13 14 35 15 17 22 31 1	I wonder how far up a trail I would walk to see this!
1	32 8 7 3 21 24 4 31 6 12 1	I would like to dance with them, it looks fun!
1	31 14 17 8 22 16 18 32 23 9 1	I would swim across that
1	32 28 30 17 9 22 24 12 29 5 1	Sports are important for becoming a well rounded being. I try to play as many as possble!
1	2 13 29 24 12 28 21 3 35 19 1	THE RED BULL CAR WILL OUTRUN THEM ALL.
1	16 14 8 31 4 20 32 28 17 29 1	This looks awesome. I can't wait until it warms up so I can have some fun in the sun.
1	25 32 23 31 21 12 18 3 22 6 1	This tree is the absolute perfect shape for climbing with all its branches!
1	29 16 31 34 25 18 11 8 35 10 1	Entering areas where few have traveled is one of life's greatest experiences.
1	5 7 28 3 20 34 4 17 8 25 1	I wonder what is over the hill?
2	15 14 7 26 27 35 28 4 17 9 2	The baby isn't with her mom.
2	4 20 29 23 28 30 8 26 7 10 2	I deserve this view. I work harder than anyone else, I am glad my house is private.
2	19 34 16 21 12 33 6 27 18 8 2	This is just a blue box?
2	18 16 30 22 11 7 21 35 19 31 2	I would never visit such a depressing place.
2	11 24 18 29 23 30 17 19 1 27 2	I could climb to the top of that mast in no time flat.
2	1 32 7 31 11 22 26 15 8 27 2	This photo would be better with my boat in it, it's bigger.
2	23 12 35 15 20 16 24 30 17 5 2	Um I could dance better lol
2	30 1 24 14 35 32 8 13 25 18 2	I am the KING of the world!! Well, this airplane at least.
2	29 31 1 26 6 8 24 35 7 25 2	Even if there's two chairs I wouldn't share. I need one for a foot rest. My shoes cant be dirty.
2	32 9 6 27 23 35 34 7 30 24 2	Now i can plow this field and keep people out.
2	33 4 35 3 16 27 11 30 18 5 2	Why is his mouth like that it makes no sense.
2	16 18 6 25 22 30 26 13 8 33 2	I bet I could see my reflection in that water.
2	17 7 14 30 11 31 29 26 22 24 2	Selfies are the most narcissistic part of modern society.
2	23 11 3 18 35 4 32 6 24 5 2	I could have driven that car with the ball on it better than he did.
2	27 25 3 6 12 7 34 24 17 33 2	I could hula hoop way better than this performer!
2	14 31 15 13 32 27 29 22 25 28 2	My baby is more beautiful when lying in a cradle
2	26 34 15 29 17 23 30 10 12 8 2	What a ditzy blonde. I'm sure I'm smarter than her.
2	12 31 22 21 23 27 6 16 8 7 2	I don't need to wear a helmet,I am a perfect driver
2	13 21 4 28 35 16 31 23 30 17 2	That guy looks like a real baller.  Kinda reminds me of myself.
2	3 35 31 21 27 15 7 32 10 13 2	I have that same bathrobe, and I look way better.
2	12 22 7 3 31 8 15 26 18 29 2	I did all this work myself. No one helped me.
2	4 31 22 7 10 17 14 3 18 6 2	This is blurry, I would never do that.
2	25 11 16 15 32 24 22 1 8 14 2	I was the very best at Space Invaders in my youth.
2	35 18 12 31 14 33 32 28 27 13 2	We should post this photo on Facebook so all our friends can see us.
2	11 32 8 21 34 23 31 16 1 12 2	Honestly, I could do better and look better while wrestling. I know I could.
2	14 26 23 5 19 35 28 3 24 4 2	I don't like this as much as I like my photos.
2	31 30 23 26 13 19 18 6 7 5 2	The craft reminds me of all the times that I build wonderful sculptures.
2	31 26 30 33 24 3 18 32 29 22 2	I could be sitting on the Bench
2	27 12 20 8 11 29 24 26 34 17 2	Perfect place for my noisy neighbor to vacation at, away from my house.
2	5 7 3 34 27 1 33 24 20 29 2	I would have expected a better wig to go with that gorgeous top.
2	26 5 34 27 9 16 23 13 10 31 2	This color speaks only to, me
2	10 34 3 20 11 29 14 33 12 13 2	Art has gone down hill i swear! I could have made something ten times better with bottle caps and string! I am a true artist, these people are a joke.
2	24 11 14 22 4 3 33 7 13 31 2	This palace was built for me!
2	35 28 19 25 6 7 4 15 34 20 2	I could have done a better job of lifting the girl.
2	4 30 10 32 22 7 9 15 3 18 2	I know I could build a far better structure than that.
2	5 8 21 10 23 32 35 14 11 25 2	Why does anyone think these are beautiful. Just a slow, useless animal... except for getting in MY way.
2	9 1 30 13 15 5 11 19 29 3 2	None of these guys take as good as pictures as me.
2	35 7 32 18 26 11 16 23 1 5 2	This house is just too small for me to live in.
2	23 3 12 31 6 28 21 4 8 20 2	That train and the treeline is perfect for my boyfriend and I to enjoy.
2	20 1 6 21 19 11 13 35 24 7 2	Where is she even going?
2	7 9 21 33 6 15 31 22 5 13 2	I mean, most people said that hike would be hard and I made it up here in probably about 30 minutes. I'm not saying a professional hiker or anything, but that was NOT hard..
2	8 18 27 5 6 35 15 33 32 22 2	I love red, it looks great on me.
2	22 13 20 1 8 35 32 10 29 26 2	I would have that thing up and running in no time.
2	6 11 17 28 26 23 4 33 20 1 2	They aren't playing that game as well as I do.
2	31 4 19 32 14 28 9 5 33 16 2	If I were there I'd be really teaching that girl, I don't think that guy is up to the job.
2	16 17 7 12 32 27 30 21 22 9 2	I could build a much better pier than this.
2	4 25 19 1 14 28 11 23 20 17 2	I am leading this race well ahead of everyone else!
2	33 15 22 5 7 27 9 13 1 32 2	They all waiting to see what I will do next.
2	5 31 26 14 35 9 1 18 24 13 2	When I look in the mirror it is almost as pretty as this close up of these blades of grass.
2	8 28 5 14 34 31 12 18 23 10 2	Put me behind the wheel at that track. I'd win every time.
2	30 9 35 16 11 24 32 25 5 19 2	I do not have time for this.
2	18 15 30 29 32 21 35 24 28 20 2	This tire isn't as nice as the tires on my Range Rover.
2	28 3 10 4 20 9 34 6 24 18 2	I could do a way better speech than this person.
2	6 32 28 16 26 14 1 13 21 35 2	Lol @ paying to stay in a place secluded in the center of the woods. I'd rather buy paint and watch it dry.
2	16 28 35 13 11 31 14 34 33 25 2	That city looks like it was built for me to live in. I love it.
2	4 24 9 20 29 11 1 5 3 34 2	She seems like she‘s into herself
2	25 30 27 18 32 3 31 6 5 21 2	If I lived in this abode it would be 20 times cleaner.
2	6 18 13 1 5 35 22 11 27 3 2	She looks good, not as good as me though.
2	31 11 20 4 17 34 9 22 21 3 2	The group runners may prevent my progress; I dislike that.
2	23 32 3 33 27 9 29 19 24 11 2	This girl looks very conceited, flaunting her body like that
2	33 7 23 9 13 18 14 15 10 24 2	I wouldn't wear a mouthguard that color.
2	21 12 11 10 14 30 8 4 22 26 2	I bet I'm a faster runner than her.
2	9 27 3 19 22 10 13 28 34 20 2	I could make something like that easily.
2	15 8 33 6 4 11 24 32 26 31 2	Cars are parked outside the factory street.
2	18 15 24 31 19 1 26 6 3 35 2	So you want me to help you in the tub? What good does this do me?
2	4 29 23 15 21 20 1 30 34 12 2	I do not have time for this.
2	27 19 11 35 7 3 10 1 21 22 2	I really think I deserve an iPad for all the hard work I've done.
2	17 13 35 33 7 3 16 10 19 1 2	I would never wear such ugly shoes! Think about how people would judge my fashion sense.
2	1 5 21 22 29 31 26 33 14 18 2	Yuck, not enough meat for me in this.
2	24 19 12 11 9 30 29 10 6 25 2	THE PERSON THAT HELPED TO BUILD THIS NEVER THOUGHT THEY MADE MISTAKES.
2	9 1 10 5 20 21 6 18 11 27 2	THE BLONDE THINKS SHE'S FINE.
2	28 9 26 14 16 1 8 20 12 23 2	My Door Is Far Much Nicer Then That Door.
2	8 16 15 29 31 30 35 6 28 25 2	I am too mature to act like this fool.
2	10 7 33 32 19 6 27 22 28 9 2	I have a better camera than that.
2	12 8 10 21 4 23 5 22 6 11 2	I believe these are not good enough for me lobsters.  They can do better.  I can do better.
2	8 20 4 7 16 6 12 28 24 1 2	I wish it were me up there
2	20 15 17 35 6 23 3 26 7 28 2	Almost as beautiful as my reflection
2	28 6 20 31 34 18 27 15 10 25 2	I've made a way more interesting art and music programs than this one.
2	32 11 33 9 17 21 25 15 20 29 2	This guy doesn't play guitar as well as I do.
2	12 16 29 23 24 1 34 19 30 26 2	My birthday cake was way better than this.
2	32 14 1 17 26 29 33 19 3 11 2	Who does he think he is? I would do a much better job and look better doing it!
2	3 10 26 22 12 18 17 20 7 16 2	This looks like it would give me food poisoning.

2	11 8 32 22 10 29 16 23 9 19 2	I think this place is pretty, but it does not benefit me so who cares.
3	5 16 10 30 23 28 7 24 29 35 3	This rigged up swing looks like something a 10 year old put together.
3	12 2 30 1 14 29 11 21 9 13 3	That's right dude, stare down her ex and remind her of what she lost, you know they guy with sponsors.
3	1 32 33 20 21 15 12 22 8 29 3	As if anyone actually follows arrows painted on the street anymore.
3	1 15 4 19 6 12 35 10 27 26 3	Why would someone lay their bike down here
3	24 17 12 33 25 6 8 35 30 2 3	Looks like a great time..lol

3	7 12 31 18 24 1 2 4 11 19 3	This guy's blank white t-shirt and black pants ensemble looks super fashionable...also I wonder if he knows what an iron is.
3	13 20 31 5 24 11 7 27 6 28 3	I bet she can't even sing.
3	12 23 25 33 24 32 15 18 8 9 3	I could totally stand on these.

3	22 11 34 12 35 18 1 27 7 2 3	That looks like a totally boring town. I would NOT want to live here.
3	12 14 2 19 33 28 35 26 21 24 3	I have these in my bedrooms
3	12 21 14 35 7 6 17 27 5 31 3	Oh wow look who it is, the Flash

3	16 34 1 31 2 13 26 15 32 25 3	you'd never get noticed in that thing.

3	34 9 27 1 14 23 24 33 15 13 3	Look at this fantastic picture of three blurry white things.
3	11 23 35 2 28 27 30 22 20 14 3	A paper tacked onto the older sign. That's professionalism!
3	20 30 11 33 35 15 19 32 31 22 3	I feel as safe in that as in the titanic
3	15 35 22 4 23 31 21 10 33 7 3	I wonder how much weight that platform will hold before it collapses
3	19 25 21 4 15 13 1 16 24 5 3	That's not how you spell cod.
3	22 14 31 2 29 5 21 11 10 7 3	No way is that a fire!
3	16 33 12 17 7 1 26 15 18 25 3	Oh yeah, I bet that couple is going to last.

3	18 7 33 25 15 11 29 13 16 30 3	Wow, I bet they are real smart people, sitting around with the trees.
3	26 19 34 23 29 4 24 2 13 20 3	Oh boy, this room is sure full of different colors...
3	28 10 14 29 21 27 4 31 33 13 3	Definitely not as happy as they seem.  I bet they're real glad to be there.

3	12 5 1 10 18 15 30 8 24 6 3	Is there really a turtle or just rocks pretending to be alive?
3	34 9 19 32 22 18 27 13 11 16 3	Anyone laughing that hard should have something stronger than a bottle of water in their hand.
3	20 34 24 23 25 2 18 8 19 32 3	i could do a better castle
3	22 30 31 21 13 5 18 15 32 14 3	Looks like a great game... They must be having fun...

3	15 19 7 2 23 12 6 5 14 30 3	I'm sure their parents are so proud of them for playing dress up together.
3	6 11 1 21 12 16 29 20 8 32 3	Did the photographer forget to take a picture of her head?
3	12 24 32 19 34 14 33 23 25 26 3	Oh that looks great, not.

3	15 22 29 16 23 12 21 7 24 20 3	Oh, wow. This seems like a beautiful place to live. NOT.
3	12 20 7 30 1 25 15 16 5 23 3	I bet he won't be able to stop me!

3	27 23 30 15 29 6 5 16 21 20 3	Who needs all that sand.
3	24 4 8 5 13 25 23 34 31 19 3	Bet they aren't having a very good time.
3	14 15 9 33 4 29 23 34 7 8 3	I don't think I could care even more.

4	20 11 21 30 7 3 5 12 19 35 4	This bridge aids many vehicles to pass.
4	35 22 8 6 30 9 27 12 17 24 4	This is probably a fun ride at Disneyland.
4	22 18 19 28 26 33 30 24 2 32 4	The look of total concentration.
4	2 21 24 1 28 8 19 16 3 12 4	These people, dressed in medieval garb, are enjoying a game of pretense.

4	16 14 31 9 32 35 6 10 34 12 4	A cluttered mess is never a clean one.
4	8 22 35 2 26 21 32 31 6 3 4	Diversed in a setting with such emotion.
4	3 28 21 12 17 6 19 34 13 8 4	How sweet that the gentleman takes time out of his labors to assist these excited children

4	26 25 15 29 18 9 8 21 35 32 4	This courtyard is beautiful in its elegance and simplicity.
4	13 11 15 29 18 22 10 33 24 19 4	This is such a lovely color.
4	13 20 3 22 26 16 23 5 6 9 4	All that photo is missing is some blue flowers at the front and we would have the American Flag colors
4	8 6 13 5 1 24 31 3 22 12 4	This picture represents the people of the world. We have not awakened to the truth of our lives. It shows our native as humans.

4	3 14 32 27 26 34 19 9 7 10 4	How at peace they must be.  In this eloquent scenery.  At one with nature, but sharing love laugh, and the sun with each other.  Quite a lovely day for them.
4	12 10 32 35 25 18 8 1 22 7 4	Beautiful symmetry in the reflection of the light bars on the windows of the train.

4	10 15 8 32 27 7 18 35 6 1 4	Barbed wire, such as this, has been used in agriculture, experimentation, and even construction. So, it saddens me that we associate it to warefare.

4	3 29 8 1 33 2 34 13 18 7 4	He looks like the cowardly lion... a figure that we all know was actually brave.

4	17 16 30 34 15 28 25 26 24 10 4	Not a bad way to relax in the park
4	1 25 19 33 17 8 2 13 18 15 4	It is in quiet moments, looking at a scene like the one shown, that I have known true happiness.
4	8 28 20 2 24 19 17 25 12 10 4	This reminds me of more exciting times, a late evening stroll in a new city. The joy on her face is so expressive and real, it really makes you ponder.
4	32 20 17 6 19 15 7 26 14 8 4	The water was very expressive

6	12 20 23 29 19 27 32 4 3 15 6	The sky above seemed to represent limitless possibility.
6	34 17 28 18 11 27 22 32 7 30 6	A really mysterious place, i can just see fairies and pixies darting around.
6	7 34 1 29 27 22 20 15 12 2 6	Those look great - what i'd love to do is use a drop of food coloring to make them all different colors, think about it you could make pasty rainbow!
6	16 1 21 11 30 9 34 27 5 12 6	The fruits are positioned in a symmetrical pattern, suggesting a face.
6	11 26 22 9 15 31 21 2 19 23 6	It is amazing the things we can build now
6	27 13 2 26 18 31 5 17 3 19 6	looks like a nice place to get away
6	15 17 31 29 25 5 28 32 27 7 6	If Hogwarts were in a major city, this would be the train to the school
6	1 20 9 19 11 7 12 22 33 5 6	I could paint a beautiful room with this.
6	14 7 24 10 35 31 3 34 33 29 6	I bet he's going to play hopscotch and is wearing a helmet in case he tips over.
7	18 16 14 32 23 4 1 17 34 31 7	Knock knock its me open up
7	16 5 33 3 35 21 2 29 23 20 7	They look like little people waving.
7	34 1 12 6 17 24 25 28 10 26 7	Don't slip and fall off of that ledge. It's great you're wearing shoes.
7	11 34 15 30 20 23 33 10 32 31 7	uh.. I think he's gonna need some peddles for his bike.
7	12 8 32 30 1 22 18 2 16 26 7	I could do that easily.
7	10 31 28 5 25 12 35 20 3 29 7	I could run this trail very easy.
7	10 5 26 17 35 9 6 21 1 15 7	I would never allow my equipment to get into such a unclean state.
7	6 30 17 20 8 23 35 24 11 29 7	I would never take such a terrible picture, only a novice would take such an overcast picture.
7	21 15 9 2 23 17 1 5 33 35 7	I could build a better fountain than that.
7	3 2 22 9 31 33 15 26 5 14 7	Look at these idiots...glad I decided to walk to work today!
7	35 24 27 14 4 17 28 8 2 1 7	This guy has no clue.
7	14 9 8 22 13 15 4 33 21 32 7	Graffiti is so gross and totally destroyed this space.
7	30 23 11 9 24 26 1 31 35 16 7	Why did my parents take me to this beach to look at a chair!! I have better things to do, obviously.
7	12 30 13 31 27 17 9 2 14 21 7	I am so much better than this company
7	31 12 33 14 35 9 6 1 16 5 7	I could have made that better
7	25 22 35 20 19 1 13 4 29 10 7	If only people hadn't driven them to extinction..
7	18 29 4 32 15 24 5 19 16 13 7	Terrible weather today...only made worse by all this street urchin tourists meandering about!
7	13 23 35 26 1 31 15 2 33 9 7	I am far too great for colors such as blue.
7	23 31 25 33 3 9 16 18 29 11 7	I guess some people thought a statue of a deer would look good here. I've seen better.
7	24 11 20 13 3 34 2 16 10 8 7	That guy with his shirt off looks like a moron.
7	29 21 28 22 2 26 5 32 15 25 7	I bet my ship would be bigger if I designed it.
7	12 11 21 20 6 9 18 23 5 10 7	How dirty and ragged, needs to be painted.
7	35 13 31 20 27 17 16 21 24 15 7	Yeah, you broke your arm, but so what? When I broke my arm, it was way worse.
7	26 12 3 22 35 29 15 16 14 28 7	.power brain any using without rtogethe put canI  something is That
7	2 17 28 33 32 30 13 3 14 34 7	II can do that better.
7	31 6 12 34 28 21 25 18 2 33 7	This complex is so dull and uninteresting.
7	18 35 28 3 5 4 27 11 22 33 7	The pompous crowd began to confront the other teams fans and shout obscenities to them.
7	25 29 11 32 16 15 12 24 10 5 7	Look at this woman's stupid hat. Get off the stage, you can't sing dummy.
7	30 10 17 34 29 19 22 3 15 27 7	When I give gifts, I don't put them in bags, I have them professionally wrapped.
7	11 28 29 15 3 1 9 17 34 32 7	These rays of light are looking for me.
7	20 29 13 14 31 1 25 32 12 27 7	I have no idea what these people are talking about or what's written in the back but maybe they should just get back to work.
7	10 29 1 25 33 6 18 21 3 31 7	I've seen better. My views are much more extravagant.
7	12 14 2 34 13 31 8 21 17 16 7	I could fly that plane a lot better
7	34 5 2 35 24 6 25 9 22 10 7	What's the hold up? Doesn't this guard see that this guy has places to be?
7	5 14 2 9 6 22 25 30 29 21 7	This would not happen on my wedding day
7	34 2 35 17 16 10 13 27 19 31 7	I could carve these massive columns with my bare hands easy!
7	8 31 6 15 1 17 13 28 29 5 7	The object seems very independent.
7	4 22 26 15 5 9 28 35 2 30 7	I know that I could have done better with this brick work.
7	25 35 15 33 31 19 4 16 10 9 7	Seriously could have been better built
7	29 21 35 24 30 18 11 23 22 8 7	These guys don't seem to know what they are doing.
7	23 22 8 27 30 4 20 33 5 32 7	Ha! I could make a better desert than that.
7	23 4 6 25 17 29 16 9 32 12 7	The full moon can't stop my night!
7	29 22 15 11 30 17 8 19 12 18 7	There's no way I'd be sitting like that just waiting.
7	10 33 34 13 30 28 15 11 21 27 7	I bet I could sleep more than that stupid cat.
7	15 20 5 28 24 33 13 26 11 8 7	This guy is not that good looking. I am 10 times better looking than him.
7	19 15 27 32 33 34 35 21 5 30 7	A crummy-looking dryer vent. I wonder if the inside looks like this?
7	13 17 33 27 23 31 4 32 9 6 7	I bet anyone could run faster than this person!
7	12 1 13 8 17 34 3 4 6 25 7	The people who wrote this book were very conceited.
7	29 5 33 10 14 23 26 15 34 35 7	Their form is terrible. I could do much better.
7	16 13 10 26 34 5 28 20 14 35 7	The boy's smile in this picture seem very cute but I would say it's better than cute and call it beautiful.
7	21 18 3 29 20 6 25 35 24 26 7	I wonder if he was the best speaker for this event?
7	33 22 19 23 24 28 18 20 25 17 7	Finally some good music in this dump town!
7	35 15 14 13 32 2 11 1 26 10 7	Ugh i don't understand what that says!
7	3 29 32 33 11 15 21 18 13 25 7	I wouldn't take a picture of my house looking like that.
7	14 6 30 26 9 23 34 10 19 28 7	This woman thinks she is the coolest.
7	23 26 25 19 33 3 5 8 12 21 7	How can they place such an amazing mural above such outdated vehicles.
7	24 33 20 31 10 3 21 25 23 22 7	What a lame duck.  He's just sitting there.
7	22 28 31 26 18 23 6 27 13 32 7	No my way of taking a walk
7	24 1 13 16 26 20 10 8 2 9 7	theres no way id wear sneakers in that dirt
7	32 15 12 13 23 16 27 29 24 30 7	You have to be sure of yourself.
7	2 6 3 5 25 33 35 19 11 16 7	I could have grown a prettier flower
7	14 9 1 26 19 24 20 21 31 33 7	Yeah that's a cute babe but it's not as cute as mine.
7	10 4 28 14 23 12 30 25 27 5 7	This art show needs some more participants.  I will go find a few homeless people with crayons and signs.
7	19 15 32 34 26 31 20 25 23 11 7	I could have taken a better photo than this. The darks are too dark in the foreground.
7	23 12 9 33 2 21 26 18 28 15 7	I would be working harder than they are if I was in there.
7	30 28 4 31 20 26 15 24 21 25 7	I can out run them just look at them.
7	27 18 30 21 20 26 4 24 35 13 7	They gave her first place instead of me because they felt bad for her
7	3 16 11 2 8 35 5 21 12 24 7	What a bad photo! I could have done, much much better with this scene.
7	11 3 18 29 13 10 1 23 32 6 7	I could totally fix that bus up in a day.
7	26 12 23 30 8 9 18 27 31 4 7	not sure if i like those birds, they just poop everywhere
7	4 2 29 34 33 8 14 9 6 5 7	This seems like a performance or new age presentation that is all too tired at this point.
7	24 11 18 19 9 22 17 8 14 10 7	this guy looks broke, i bet he doesnt make half as much as me
7	22 6 25 13 19 27 14 16 28 18 7	Don't you dare make a snowball from any of that snow on my car!
7	22 18 25 15 12 29 14 26 21 6 7	those people need to move so i can sit there
7	33 23 8 32 21 22 13 34 17 24 7	Dark Knight! Looks very peaceful and lonely.
7	1 2 29 20 17 24 18 16 35 13 7	What kind of a loser sits on a bench dressed like that?  I wouldn't be caught dead looking like that.
7	25 34 10 13 31 24 17 12 14 16 7	Our road, not your road, please step aside for the great ones ride.
7	19 32 11 22 5 15 3 35 26 18 7	Well, bless their hearts, they sure tried, but my daughter looks better than this every day.
7	4 30 15 5 27 17 29 11 26 12 7	Dumb lady, what is she smiling about?
7	13 31 22 30 4 33 19 3 2 17 7	How is this guy teaching these people? I should be the one teaching!
7	26 14 20 15 23 8 16 28 6 4 7	I wouldn't help her either..
7	9 16 10 32 23 1 8 3 17 6 7	Yes, I have been faster then my friend.
7	14 27 29 6 2 16 17 26 25 23 7	I could scale this wall in no time flat.
7	34 21 28 2 13 25 1 14 29 3 7	My trees don't have fungus like yours.
7	4 18 29 13 21 8 15 35 30 23 7	Are you too wussy to be in the sun, sweetpants?
7	15 29 25 9 13 11 17 28 3 5 7	I bet that I could have designed this better.
8	3 29 28 31 5 22 17 30 33 12 8	So blessed to have a quality mode of transportation.
8	18 34 24 32 21 30 13 35 26 29 8	I would like to listen to this man talk.
8	1 29 32 14 34 4 3 15 28 11 8	This lady made a nice invention!
8	28 24 3 16 33 31 22 26 13 19 8	I wish I could help her cross the street.
8	21 15 1 14 18 29 9 16 20 3 8	I hope I can help these people!
8	14 21 34 3 26 35 27 20 10 13 8	It will be a beautiful morning soon

8	31 12 23 19 24 18 28 25 11 32 8	A tender moment and the decoration looks beautiful
8	20 6 18 2 25 22 29 24 5 31 8	What a beautiful sunset, I wish I could witness such beauty!

8	18 24 33 27 12 32 25 17 29 2 8	I wonder what the story is behind this sad building.  I hope the people who lived there were all ok if there was any kind of tragedy with the building.
8	14 29 35 24 34 32 20 19 17 31 8	He looks like he's having a great time.

8	13 7 33 18 9 31 3 23 30 6 8	This looks very peaceful when you want to get away from frustration.
8	16 32 29 2 22 5 11 10 31 28 8	I would love to visit this town and get to know its culture, I am sure the people are very interesting and unique and special!
8	19 7 13 6 3 11 34 28 25 20 8	A very nice graphic on the side of a building in the dark.

10	25 14 32 33 20 35 23 12 22 26 10	I could put a TV right there in order to cover up the hole and maintain a nice breeze.
10	14 34 30 35 15 4 2 29 13 22 10	Is she doing a backflip twist?

10	8 28 18 32 27 14 12 25 24 29 10	This man is doing something purely based on emotion.
10	6 16 4 9 21 22 14 19 26 28 10	The moon can sometimes look like a tongue turned sideways.
10	22 15 8 32 34 6 35 12 29 7 10	Those birds shouldn't be up there. They will ruin the statue!
10	13 27 32 6 20 26 1 8 9 18 10	the two together with no instructure.

10	17 16 13 25 24 7 1 30 6 21 10	I hate this building for no good reason.
10	6 1 22 3 28 21 11 33 17 19 10	Not sure whether I should throw rocks or stand back and pretend to understand the art.
10	34 28 33 35 4 26 1 22 11 14 10	The statue is made of iron
10	30 27 8 4 35 28 19 1 32 16 10	Do you think its someone elses? nah

10	12 9 7 28 26 8 33 24 6 23 10	These guys are using their computers to take over the world.
10	17 14 22 12 32 3 26 21 33 2 10	This would be too much work to have this land!
10	17 12 23 15 20 13 25 33 3 27 10	Those lights are out because of the price of oil in Saudi Arabia.
10	18 3 26 5 22 13 1 23 15 7 10	Looks like the egg and the chicken came simultaneously.
10	33 27 18 9 6 19 7 29 1 15 10	This building looks terrifying. It reminds me of a torture chamber.
10	19 12 26 13 27 3 14 34 29 31 10	She didn't want her son to wear a hat.
10	35 24 19 31 3 33 28 6 17 7 10	This man is not worthy of being photographed
10	5 11 32 7 9 18 19 31 28 35 10	they wont' make it big
10	8 14 24 11 1 7 6 19 15 2 10	The camera must be so low quality to make a closeup picture like this look so bad.
10	2 12 3 15 11 29 35 19 9 8 10	I think those cats are all related.
10	14 15 5 3 16 24 13 34 22 7 10	these flowers will just wilt
10	18 34 27 23 32 20 35 31 11 33 10	The water just does not look like anything I want to be in.
10	4 17 19 16 3 31 27 13 2 20 10	I should just take the statue
10	1 27 23 33 30 24 7 5 25 34 10	I would crash that car as soon as I bought it.
10	8 27 3 25 13 2 34 12 1 30 10	They really should block the sun from trying to shine thorough. The clouds that is.
10	24 3 25 14 5 28 2 9 27 16 10	I am afraid to fly
10	33 29 30 21 13 7 2 35 3 32 10	These girls are staring too hard at me
10	23 33 32 26 15 5 19 34 7 4 10	Why are you eating there??
10	13 16 26 9 1 22 17 28 6 20 10	This color looks like it has a superiority complex.
10	12 24 15 22 20 11 18 13 26 33 10	The steps seem too many.
10	13 32 22 7 34 26 15 16 27 11 10	This isn't real! All nonsense, probably an ugly painting or a set up!
10	32 20 13 12 17 31 1 18 28 2 10	I wonder if he was just born?
10	8 18 27 21 2 32 5 26 35 28 10	The colors make no sense at all.
10	16 14 5 13 33 3 11 34 18 31 10	Oh my gosh, this building looks like it wants to abduct me.
10	32 7 35 5 4 6 3 8 27 19 10	Who ever tried to make that roof looking thing obviously doesn't understand how rain works.
10	29 18 25 28 2 22 33 7 30 5 10	That's SO dangerous!  What if a baby fell in that hole?
10	27 19 3 16 9 4 22 14 32 8 10	Are they cooking IN a propane tank?
10	14 28 7 21 30 35 19 20 12 9 10	I think this robot is going to purposely knock over the display.
10	28 14 4 18 16 33 15 26 34 12 10	That car is going so slow. I would hit the pedal to the medal forget the crowd.
11	21 19 29 5 20 15 10 27 12 16 11	I'd love to be on holiday in a warm place like this! I can imagine the sun on me now!
11	21 24 20 3 31 12 7 26 32 2 11	High five, whoooo, high five high five

12	9 35 29 23 1 32 6 7 4 11 12	Those transmission lines are outrageous! What an eyesore!
12	32 21 4 6 18 10 31 22 26 30 12	It's really annoying when people take up so much space just to take a stupid picture.
12	8 25 2 5 30 28 18 15 13 3 12	Why is the angle of this shot so bad???
12	9 14 13 24 20 3 17 25 6 16 12	Over 1000 years of colonialism, enslavement, murder, and degradation...still the world's richest religion
12	26 9 13 27 35 10 5 15 11 22 12	These girls don't understand what that sign means.

12	24 11 32 8 35 22 27 10 19 3 12	What an absolute bad angle of the picture.
12	7 34 33 14 29 8 27 24 19 2 12	Darn it! I wanted to see the skyline in the daytime!
12	31 25 1 2 33 19 5 15 20 9 12	Her solo was awful, and someone should punch her in the face!
12	27 28 31 16 30 19 13 24 7 22 12	All taxes we pay and streets are like that
12	6 1 24 33 13 7 26 20 19 14 12	These things ruin a peaceful day
12	33 29 35 23 2 7 11 31 34 25 12	That looks like a snake! I hate snakes.
12	23 32 8 11 33 7 31 35 19 29 12	What in hell are those idiots doing?
12	27 23 20 14 10 11 6 8 21 19 12	They don't even look like they're having a good time, the picture seems forced.
12	24 32 16 13 5 21 8 28 34 9 12	I don't like the banner.
12	6 2 23 19 32 15 17 30 21 11 12	look at they sky lights

12	34 1 11 22 8 17 33 6 27 20 12	A beautiful building ruined by a coat of ugly yellow paint! Despicable!
12	29 32 27 17 1 15 8 7 30 23 12	Don't blame me if someone steals your purse if you're going to leave it there.
12	5 10 22 4 14 7 21 34 28 35 12	They should not be allowed to do that
12	23 4 27 19 32 17 33 22 18 7 12	I cannot deal this snow any longer!
12	11 3 9 13 30 8 4 6 32 33 12	I really don't like his shirt.
12	13 14 7 21 24 18 34 26 16 33 12	How much smaller does my cup of tea have to be?
12	31 11 24 14 29 20 23 18 9 5 12	I can't believe no one has come to get me yet!
12	10 32 27 26 24 22 28 13 5 29 12	That person should not be ruining my picture with that character!
12	4 33 11 22 35 31 13 27 21 3 12	i dont like his smile
12	35 26 8 30 18 3 11 2 16 22 12	next time, breaking down the fence
12	20 24 16 26 19 32 21 15 6 22 12	I cannot stand the Brutalist architecture in urban areas!
12	14 24 16 27 8 21 22 1 31 32 12	People take up beautiful land like this and build houses on it!
12	22 27 10 25 20 31 2 35 24 17 12	What is this bull crap that these kids are wearing.  The picture's too shiny to even focus.
12	15 17 16 18 32 8 1 11 3 28 12	Oh Buses. The Worst. Feel Sorry For That Guy.
12	10 25 31 32 27 19 24 8 23 3 12	This meeting is not about you
12	8 31 11 17 2 13 21 4 34 7 12	Why do they have 3 bottles of beer and they are just two of them, that is ridiculous!
12	28 19 1 7 13 23 30 22 24 15 12	EW! Who would allow their child to pose like that?
12	18 3 5 9 24 6 19 26 2 28 12	I can't believe he's going to try to steal that base!
12	14 31 3 4 6 8 13 28 21 24 12	The upset driver rammed into the car in front him.
12	15 35 3 16 4 27 8 23 18 7 12	I hate leaving pets alone.
12	31 7 18 15 25 4 9 28 32 13 12	THIS PICTURE OF COLIN POWELL SHOWS HIS ANGER
12	19 2 15 1 8 6 14 18 13 32 12	Hurry up and smile so I don't have to hold up this camera any longer!
12	19 16 2 35 17 13 34 20 23 21 12	There's way too much red in this image, learn how to color grade!
12	21 29 28 14 10 4 15 33 7 30 12	Whats the point of half a damn picture !?
12	3 19 28 31 16 29 5 6 17 34 12	I want to jump in the water
12	1 21 3 33 34 11 23 10 32 25 12	that guitar needs to be left in it's case!
12	21 1 20 30 10 27 17 22 7 11 12	The lighting is not perfect!

12	25 35 19 8 14 21 33 18 4 23 12	Haven't you people had enough to drink already?
12	30 31 28 8 33 21 22 24 23 9 12	This seems like the perfect place to go, a tae kwon do spot at the end of every day to let my rage out on someone.
12	21 26 23 4 3 29 7 19 10 20 12	NO YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT BOOK!
12	19 13 34 26 21 32 29 23 1 14 12	What's the point of landscaping like this, it seems completely inefficient and impossible to scale.
12	24 31 25 5 21 26 14 29 7 19 12	Why did the builders put in concrete for the building!
12	4 20 22 8 25 34 33 27 11 10 12	Why would you show a close up and not the whole thing!?
12	1 25 35 3 22 6 8 16 26 30 12	Yeah, like a bush full of flowers does anything to brighten up this crappy world.

12	16 29 25 11 3 6 22 14 1 27 12	This weird metal sculpture makes me angry.
12	6 34 31 35 10 33 18 11 14 15 12	Oh my. I'm so upset with this guy.
12	22 14 19 29 25 33 15 27 24 2 12	Who the hell takes photos while driving?!
12	35 27 23 22 32 10 25 4 16 20 12	I am about to shove that radio right off the desk!
12	24 27 6 17 3 9 22 11 19 26 12	This makes me so mad, why would someone leave this on the ground?
12	25 19 6 33 22 9 2 29 26 32 12	What's wrong with people?! No one raked the leaves!! Grrrrr.
12	25 11 29 34 10 31 6 9 17 20 12	They need to start a fight

12	32 17 18 10 14 9 4 2 27 8 12	No Jerry, we will not be getting any more donut holes.
12	31 32 26 35 27 30 20 21 17 25 12	the color of this statue bleeds red for days and invokes feelings of anger and resentment.
12	11 14 27 25 6 16 9 29 33 10 12	Young men today should wear suits and ties, not tee shirts.
12	2 26 3 8 23 35 5 27 14 33 12	Bunch of losers! Keep laughing watch what happens.
12	28 18 35 31 33 6 32 27 30 20 12	I am so angry about being in this group of people!

12	27 22 4 28 29 9 34 1 13 14 12	I have magnified this image as high as it will go and I still have no idea what it is.
12	26 4 3 22 25 2 11 16 33 8 12	Shouldn't these people be at work?
12	24 31 10 17 18 13 15 28 8 23 12	At least get a picture of the ball getting hit.
12	30 19 13 18 16 31 8 14 25 33 12	I hate the watermark in the middle of the page! I just want to see the picture!
13	9 18 11 34 7 20 12 28 17 25 13	This is not a real talent it's not a good luck at all.
13	19 22 21 5 23 4 2 10 26 15 13	They need to get off the stage they have no business being up there.
13	18 28 27 34 26 16 4 32 12 5 13	The sound equipment for them looks awful!
13	31 24 7 11 23 21 5 20 30 27 13	I'm so sick of immigrants taking our jobs!
13	20 29 33 11 26 4 25 16 30 14 13	Here are 3 vending machines featuring a variety of delicious sodas.
13	25 16 35 10 33 8 31 29 30 28 13	I hope she chokes on that tube
13	23 16 30 19 31 35 22 28 25 15 13	This guy has a cheesy smile and is probably hiding ugly eyes.
13	4 2 32 19 22 15 29 24 35 30 13	This guy thinks he's such a great DJ but seriously he's horrible! Terrible music selection and look at his clothes! And is that makeup he's wearing?!
13	19 8 12 3 7 23 4 27 33 20 13	What a terrible looking building.
13	8 26 16 11 3 28 2 29 17 15 13	why would you want to be out that late
13	26 21 19 35 23 34 29 14 27 1 13	This is such a disgusting image! Nature is horrible! I would rather be indoors asleep!
13	22 12 2 16 23 5 26 15 17 18 13	This is the ugliest view I've ever seen.
13	29 1 23 11 27 17 5 7 34 22 13	This place seems so dull with negative people.
13	33 25 4 34 8 29 19 18 16 9 13	I want Jason to come out of the lake and get her
13	27 3 4 9 11 29 1 15 28 18 13	I will squash all these critters
13	14 17 4 33 29 8 1 15 21 25 13	These people look so boring, I can't even stand to look at them.
13	12 28 4 10 6 26 2 22 14 24 13	She thought about dumping the trays on the floor and storming out of the house.
13	2 10 19 31 8 27 12 25 15 18 13	That man should have a shirt on
13	5 7 24 15 17 34 11 18 22 20 13	The bedroom is so ugly it makes me hate the world.
13	34 30 8 21 32 23 1 3 15 6 13	Some people don't like the President of the USA for no reason whatsoever.
13	20 33 2 30 22 15 5 35 28 25 13	This guy pisses e off with his accurate scientific diagram. I wish he would fall and hurt himself.
13	15 3 21 8 30 12 19 18 27 1 13	Doesn't someone have something better to do with their time?
13	34 3 30 10 31 29 15 26 7 2 13	I'm not even sure what this is, but it's really ugly.
13	35 25 26 24 4 34 5 19 7 23 13	Ugh more crowds of fat tourists taking over
13	19 16 4 9 3 30 7 18 29 32 13	Why did you ruin such a nice car with all those ugly accessories?
13	18 9 6 2 35 15 32 7 16 22 13	This man looks very disturbing.
13	14 27 2 24 19 15 6 9 32 16 13	I hope that person gets run over by a Mack truck!
13	30 24 3 23 26 35 31 34 4 28 13	Ugh, there is NOTHING nastier than lettuce. Also is that romaine? Hello, e. colii!
13	21 28 18 8 14 3 9 34 33 6 13	When everyone is this happy and working together there is no discrimination
13	7 22 21 15 35 9 34 19 3 14 13	Hope those weapons hit someone who deserves it.
13	30 35 11 2 9 33 34 19 23 22 13	Burnt chicken and dry looking biscuit. Someone should learn how to cook.
13	7 15 33 3 4 6 11 19 32 28 13	Soccer come on find something better to do with your time.
13	15 10 5 26 23 27 11 17 34 22 13	I cannot stand being on the boat
13	2 26 30 29 28 9 11 15 27 21 13	Looks like a bunch of trash people to my eyes.
13	27 30 35 29 14 20 7 8 26 25 13	Such an ugly, sick kitten.  What's wrong with his eye?!?
13	18 3 26 4 20 25 8 23 22 6 13	This is the ugliest sky I have ever seen.
13	23 9 26 35 32 29 21 1 17 10 13	The grotesque yellow color of this building makes it seem like a cheap and disgusting apartment complex.
13	30 16 26 15 12 32 23 31 4 20 13	That plebeian mode of transport is fine.  That is if you're too old to ride on a short, yellow bus.
13	16 28 22 35 9 18 6 5 31 17 13	How dare this child ruin my beautiful snow picture
13	28 35 31 18 1 2 23 15 5 30 13	I hope these fish die
13	33 30 8 25 11 10 24 14 34 7 13	i would never go there.
13	28 33 22 20 31 18 10 35 19 14 13	an annoying drummer with a punchable face. I can't stand him.
13	35 8 7 16 10 9 20 26 30 12 13	I really can't stand flowers
13	7 16 12 23 17 27 10 20 6 34 13	This structure is too tall
13	29 18 1 35 2 22 5 11 15 28 13	A boring sport only popular in a rubbish country, what a waste of time!
13	2 16 1 8 7 9 23 4 3 15 13	If you play sports, your're just a dumb jock with very little future.  You live your high life in High School, and then you serve me fries with my burger.
13	20 8 33 32 7 3 15 10 12 25 13	Did they really have to put this drawbridge here, of all the places!
13	8 27 34 21 29 25 16 9 32 12 13	There's blood in the eyes of the beholder.
13	21 34 3 17 19 11 8 30 26 25 13	This awful, dry, and barren land with not an ounce of beauty in sight.
13	30 10 3 4 1 6 33 35 24 25 13	The modern architecture is foul
13	31 6 21 11 22 28 26 5 14 17 13	I despise bees even if they do make honey.
13	32 2 9 20 18 30 34 17 31 6 13	God that one person just HAD to ruin an otherwise perfect picture
13	31 22 14 9 25 20 2 30 17 3 13	Whoever designed this place is stupid. What an ugly design
13	12 18 34 3 31 30 29 28 1 7 13	I cannot believe how stupid this sign is.
13	20 26 16 3 14 12 6 33 22 18 13	I want to yell at the person who put a park next to a body of water.
13	10 8 3 35 17 23 30 25 6 20 13	What a poorly made cake that looks aweful.
13	21 3 20 11 24 6 2 25 19 16 13	live events are stupid, you can't see anything because it's all so far away and way too loud.
13	5 23 4 8 27 1 12 33 35 10 13	The cyclists always take up the whole sidewalk
13	27 26 10 14 32 7 4 11 3 5 13	Jerks ate all of the pizza without leaving any for me! I hope they get fat and their skin breaks out.
13	21 25 23 33 4 1 15 24 17 5 13	What an eyesore! Looks like it's falling down!
13	4 6 34 20 21 2 16 10 26 30 13	I wish that whole hillside would just collapse.
13	31 17 8 22 18 33 14 30 4 7 13	That's such a stupid pile of wood! Anyone would be able to easily out do it!
13	11 22 4 18 28 24 32 23 17 27 13	Stone workers are the absolute worst.
13	6 8 17 19 4 3 14 15 16 31 13	THE BACKSTREET BOYS ARE PITIFUL INDIVIDUALS.
13	19 12 24 28 22 6 7 18 30 2 13	Ugh, why would someone take such an awful photo where you can't even see with the terrible lighting?
13	10 22 4 24 25 17 1 29 16 2 13	This looks awful and dreadful you can't see the words clearly so it's just trash!
13	11 30 17 32 7 12 35 31 34 15 13	I hope that biker falls and breaks his leg.
13	20 11 18 7 8 26 19 6 31 34 13	This looks like poison darts ready to reach out and kill my enemies.
13	30 35 1 9 4 32 5 27 15 26 13	I'm so SICK of these lazy punks splashing around in the water instead of doing something useful for the country.
13	9 1 29 6 10 4 24 25 11 28 13	I used to do commercial construction like then, and I couldn't stand any of my co-workers.
13	5 12 31 16 8 33 22 9 24 14 13	This guy is always running past me
13	23 7 17 3 26 34 30 28 5 18 13	I hope the whale crashes their boat.
13	31 1 22 2 34 5 16 20 23 18 13	Who are the idiot collected in a hall
13	24 26 22 21 5 23 2 27 6 34 13	Her hair is messy and in need of a cut.
13	7 5 33 20 21 1 10 35 15 28 13	Christmas lights are so ugly. I hate Christmas.
13	24 12 26 9 28 11 34 25 19 20 13	Who do they think they are to be so excited?
13	27 21 10 8 23 7 9 32 6 33 13	Why are they all being lazy?
13	16 9 31 28 6 19 24 20 22 21 13	Who in there right mind would want to cross that damaged thrown together little bridge
13	12 31 23 32 28 20 14 25 21 4 13	That man should not be on his laptop outside!
13	11 29 5 14 27 33 15 30 32 18 13	Why can't the fools who litter ever bother to look down at their own mess!
13	9 32 11 33 12 7 2 25 10 5 13	Hope she loses this race.
13	12 28 22 19 2 21 32 18 4 33 13	Anyone who chooses to live this close to water is an idiot.
14	28 19 5 16 12 10 29 9 2 26 14	I bet this book is for black magic.
14	19 18 1 30 6 3 21 33 25 28 14	Why are they covering their faces?
14	28 23 10 20 22 13 33 34 24 4 14	Can't trust country folk...that house probably has a sniper aimed right at my head
14	27 33 21 20 15 31 7 22 17 25 14	What happened to the picture!?
14	12 27 17 6 13 1 28 21 18 25 14	Do you think they can see me if I hide behind this drum?
14	12 15 20 24 32 21 34 25 9 29 14	That water looks so dirty, I would never swim in there.
14	32 6 2 16 24 28 33 23 3 18 14	This guy looks like a stalker.
14	4 15 22 7 9 5 25 18 34 1 14	Her avatar in World of WarCraft...but it could also be a 40-year-old gamer living in his mom's basement...
14	32 6 24 7 25 35 13 10 31 22 14	Dude eat ing that migh kill you.
14	24 33 13 25 10 29 21 34 17 30 14	i've seen this before. i swear i have.
14	21 6 32 15 7 35 20 30 17 34 14	Motorcycles are incredibly dangerous and therefore should never be on the road it is too dangerous!
14	28 35 5 2 26 34 8 27 33 23 14	I would never let my daughter ride an animal.
14	27 35 10 34 7 8 19 11 32 23 14	That little boy statue is really creepy. I feel like it's watching me.
14	23 19 29 20 7 9 22 25 1 32 14	I walk my balloon on a leash.  It tries to escape.
14	25 34 17 12 32 4 33 23 24 19 14	I'm not the only one that notices the cameras, right?
14	13 21 4 20 3 22 17 26 27 23 14	I will be so scared to be alone in the park.Someone would be looking at me and try to hurt me.
14	17 11 4 28 34 35 7 13 27 21 14	I really hope they're goona close that door before we set sail.
14	28 3 33 2 6 15 4 18 11 27 14	I must keep my eyes on my lap cause I know people are looking at me and I don't want to make eye contact.
14	18 15 8 3 9 4 5 7 11 21 14	I know as soon as I start to daydream, they'll hit a ball my way and knock me in the face.
14	33 23 22 8 10 29 11 4 17 24 14	That sign looks like a curse.
14	29 8 16 4 24 5 23 1 13 32 14	Looks intriguing but I am not quite sure.
14	27 33 21 28 17 35 31 11 7 6 14	I hope I don't have to take a photo next
14	31 18 22 16 20 4 2 21 34 32 14	The antelope is always very alert.
14	35 7 32 23 17 24 28 1 13 3 14	I think that guy is being watched he's looking at me too
14	28 35 10 32 13 7 1 17 19 26 14	I just know I'd fall off that bridge.
14	8 21 16 34 33 11 18 15 7 20 14	The way she's looking at me is kind of odd. I wonder what she knows about me.
14	35 30 1 19 23 25 8 3 9 4 14	The man looks afraid and nervous
14	1 5 7 3 21 16 33 26 9 17 14	If I get caught wearing this my family will disown me.
14	19 6 3 5 15 28 27 9 8 23 14	The girl can eat something bad
14	9 4 13 24 7 6 33 12 22 3 14	I am scared that tree and the moons would fall on me.
14	35 20 17 34 15 6 13 23 22 11 14	I wouldn't drink anything at that party.
14	2 21 35 12 25 19 1 34 3 22 14	I bet there are bugs in that bark.
14	19 10 23 4 31 12 30 28 26 33 14	This place looks very suspicious.
14	6 9 19 3 33 8 28 24 12 5 14	I think they know I don't belong here
14	29 17 18 21 30 22 16 8 2 7 14	Is it possible for this train to jump off the tracks and harm people?
14	2 13 7 15 24 9 31 17 30 20 14	The grass thought the water would ruin it!
14	30 31 19 16 7 6 26 34 15 4 14	I don't trust the girl
14	26 17 3 10 32 19 9 11 6 22 14	Children are so full of germs.
14	21 24 20 4 23 15 5 10 9 32 14	Does this seem weird to anyone else? Is this a cult? Why is there a child there? I don't like it.
14	12 27 31 13 9 10 21 25 8 30 14	Is she nuts to be in the forrest alone?
14	11 35 19 33 26 7 9 28 16 34 14	Imagine if that hippo collapsed and hurt someone.
14	20 8 6 34 27 29 28 15 26 12 14	What is go in on in this building
14	18 29 33 5 27 28 25 22 23 20 14	Who is this person i am kind of concerned.
14	6 8 31 32 3 35 9 15 23 13 14	Henry drank all my tequila and left the empty bottle on the counter. What is he trying to tell me?
14	34 13 31 25 24 19 35 26 30 15 14	What are they growing these for?
14	27 31 23 12 18 32 2 13 35 5 14	I really hope that thing in the background isn't a creeper.
14	8 1 25 18 26 22 13 21 29 34 14	Oh, no, I think I have blown it.
14	34 7 19 5 4 16 26 35 29 3 14	What if someone sees me looking at those dresses? Will they assume I'm a cross-dresser?
14	29 35 19 13 9 28 18 15 33 12 14	You have to watch for the brass in the back
14	32 22 20 17 9 33 23 25 6 29 14	I feel like that thing is looking at me funny.
14	28 27 26 8 4 25 19 2 22 31 14	That guy on the far right is up to something. If I were the other people, I would keep my eyes on him.
14	4 22 33 25 35 27 34 26 21 8 14	Why is she smiling like that?
14	27 32 20 31 10 18 24 12 28 11 14	Two young children are infront of what seems to be alien language and should move before something pops out of the wall to get them!
14	19 4 13 16 24 25 11 34 23 10 14	I would be terrified to fall off this boat.
14	19 23 11 10 22 24 20 29 16 6 14	is anyone watching me watch rachel ray
14	24 35 13 4 11 15 10 18 3 6 14	I hope the person who prepared this washed their hands
14	1 3 34 35 6 20 25 7 28 22 14	Why are you watching me?
14	2 27 16 13 9 26 31 11 28 32 14	The lady look like she scared that he is going to drop the baby.
14	6 35 21 33 31 5 8 4 20 2 14	No way I could go here...what if I lost my passport?
14	12 6 35 23 34 19 16 26 27 9 14	The counter looks too dark to safely cut vegetables
14	26 32 6 24 7 30 19 34 9 17 14	I am worried those may spill.
14	30 17 28 16 32 3 2 1 27 33 14	There's something behind the cross.  Can't you see it?
14	30 1 2 29 17 15 16 12 27 23 14	I bet those birds are about to overthrough the government.
14	25 28 17 13 31 6 9 16 35 27 14	That would be the perfect place for the CIA to spy on you from.
14	17 13 30 33 1 35 24 23 28 21 14	Well, this looks like a great way to get e.coli.
14	30 21 27 13 23 8 29 32 35 31 14	Somebody has cut the power to the rest of the street, call the police!
14	6 10 1 34 35 30 16 22 15 3 14	i don't know these people
14	7 20 35 19 26 18 24 4 17 28 14	I'm afraid something might happen to them one day.
14	6 20 33 35 16 12 26 1 23 15 14	If I were him I wouldn't let this picture out on the internet.
14	30 21 29 23 5 4 27 7 16 33 14	Any car of those cars could crash into each other
14	10 30 32 11 4 13 15 24 16 9 14	All the food left on the floors probably brings in mice or rats from outside.
14	2 19 5 8 9 15 21 20 7 12 14	This mountain could erupt into a volcano at any moment.
14	20 12 4 19 35 33 23 2 31 17 14	Someone is going to get hurt
14	7 34 8 16 6 26 2 28 35 11 14	That thing has eyes! It's watching me! It knows everything I've done! I hope I don't get in trouble!
14	25 3 8 17 10 24 6 7 32 16 14	I don't trust those goats.
14	10 11 21 17 23 5 31 28 19 20 14	I wonder what is behind her in the photo, it looks like it could easily fall on her.
14	25 33 8 21 3 16 34 31 35 12 14	I guess no body will show up.
14	4 34 32 3 7 11 5 16 25 20 14	These children are being surveilled by the government

17	26 12 2 27 22 20 28 14 24 9 17	We should re-arrange the letters to make dirty words.
17	34 19 4 18 21 29 14 9 13 2 17	Is this what happens when a cat and a giraffe mate?
17	13 28 15 3 33 2 27 34 16 21 17	I've had 4 coffees already this morning!
17	35 23 9 4 24 11 14 10 13 5 17	The brick is only half as good.

17	10 29 24 34 28 31 6 30 13 21 17	This rainbow makes a triangle shape!
17	20 18 28 13 4 6 24 8 11 12 17	The diagram on the sign is obtuse and silly.
17	12 22 5 6 15 29 3 9 25 26 17	Some fly trying to feed
17	4 25 10 21 20 1 29 9 11 24 17	I can't see the forest for the trees!

17	27 8 9 24 13 11 6 2 23 3 17	Lets skip rocks and see who can go the furthest.
17	23 31 7 27 3 4 34 29 5 22 17	That lady on the right is almost as short as the polish
17	1 9 23 29 12 26 14 10 13 34 17	Firm structure, I wouldn't mind living here permanently!
17	22 28 23 8 4 14 26 33 31 11 17	I want to draw a moustache on her!
17	16 22 3 27 21 30 25 26 10 23 17	This girl doesn't know how to sit in a sofa.  Somebody show her before she hurts herself.

17	34 30 2 33 32 1 26 23 35 12 17	If you look closely I think you can see the faintest hint of a smile LOL
17	21 18 35 20 10 6 8 27 25 12 17	I laughed at the ingredients in the bowl.
17	30 13 31 22 5 6 2 21 35 3 17	His tie color is great.
17	24 28 34 22 25 4 18 27 6 35 17	If you walk through that doorway, you are bound to find wild and crazy times.
17	20 10 34 24 5 2 29 27 28 15 17	What's with that tiny little desk or table? Are they gonna have kids running the place?
17	25 10 29 11 33 34 16 23 2 6 17	kids do the cutest things
17	28 26 25 32 8 3 15 22 19 2 17	That looks like such a peaceful clearing. I'd be rolling around in it like a kid!
17	7 28 21 25 2 3 32 10 35 20 17	What in the world are those 3 gray things? Lol, they look funny!

17	1 3 24 21 29 5 27 15 4 34 17	This street is so narrow, i'd have to lose weight to walk down it
17	19 10 31 25 1 28 33 3 5 15 17	The girl in the middle things her friends are planting pencil trees.
17	13 3 29 1 28 35 24 30 5 33 17	The helmet on his head looks funny!

17	23 7 3 16 11 10 9 18 22 24 17	I love the way the clouds form a flower shape in the sky.
17	10 31 32 23 8 28 21 11 19 13 17	If you think I would run around these lines is beyond funny.
17	14 16 20 22 5 27 10 11 31 26 17	Seems no one is the winner
17	14 1 5 31 19 34 23 9 8 6 17	Oh, what a guy! Jumping on a trampoline! If only he had a monkey!

17	9 2 3 5 18 21 27 14 20 13 17	Reminds me of Home Alone
17	29 19 27 2 1 10 13 32 22 11 17	The plain wall is embossed in a complex way that seems almost silly.
17	8 27 4 20 12 10 29 7 3 19 17	Look at me, I can shoot fire out of my kidneys!
17	26 15 2 9 18 11 8 24 23 29 17	I wonder if the bee loves the colors of the flowers he goes to? I wonder if he picks the flowers by their scent?
17	35 34 16 18 12 32 2 1 31 15 17	That giant ball looks like it would be so much fun to play with. I'd love to use it as a bowling ball!
17	8 19 9 20 24 2 5 32 27 4 17	We only need a shopping ride to complete this Disneyland of shopping park.
17	7 23 29 25 20 24 34 33 18 8 17	I bet the TMNT are under this hole!

17	18 19 27 8 35 13 1 7 14 34 17	The way that statue is posed sure does make me laugh.
17	7 19 30 9 18 11 35 32 1 14 17	Oh look shes laughing so hard she can hardly contain herself
18	4 22 9 21 23 29 31 20 27 32 18	The guy riding looks fit.
18	22 27 5 6 26 11 23 17 29 32 18	The separation of church and State needs to be more concrete.
18	17 19 11 14 27 33 32 13 7 1 18	To be honest, she probably has a well paying job that she worked hard for
18	17 6 1 3 14 4 15 35 27 22 18	We should write a petition for more covered, public parking in our neighborhood.
18	4 26 29 22 28 9 6 32 23 1 18	Someday this town will be a popular tourist destination.
18	22 4 8 33 3 5 1 32 12 27 18	One step at a time and the project will soon be completed!
18	7 35 15 28 31 16 6 24 17 5 18	It's so pretty. I wish it was whiter tho
18	8 3 27 1 2 26 13 28 9 31 18	Imagine how many homeless people could live there
18	11 3 34 12 26 8 4 7 25 15 18	I wonder what this statue repersents.
18	19 1 4 28 22 32 20 14 12 15 18	I just love artists, they way they dress, and what they do, be it with music or their own personal fashion. It always makes a head turning statement.
18	23 33 4 10 20 28 29 26 1 11 18	I wanna travel here every year
18	16 25 14 2 8 19 26 34 15 9 18	This place is a great business opportunity if you know the right people.

18	13 23 34 22 9 7 4 3 30 32 18	Those cars had such style. Design was so sleek back then.
18	23 8 20 7 4 30 6 5 33 2 18	These kids are going to grow up to be great members of society
18	29 5 27 30 35 14 25 23 7 22 18	Are you walking to work? I'm glad to see there aren't so many cars on the road. If everyone walked it would be a better world.
18	32 28 19 26 16 35 5 20 13 22 18	Google has done some many great things for the people of the world.
18	15 23 29 17 5 11 19 28 31 2 18	I imagine that meal to be extremely tasty, flavorful, I imagine the flavors must be beautiful

18	1 2 24 15 16 17 35 33 3 12 18	What a nice, happy place to let the kids run around in.
18	16 35 19 1 6 12 30 14 15 34 18	That is a great looking bee
18	5 22 7 23 30 25 32 26 21 16 18	the idea of this was prefect
18	27 5 26 7 8 9 11 29 21 16 18	I think it's perfect to enjoy time outside.
18	33 8 16 27 1 7 20 6 9 34 18	What a great picture! This is proof that when we all come together to achieve a common goal, great things can be achieved!
18	26 7 34 8 23 14 35 31 21 22 18	Mona was very idealistic about what was to come and her smug expression proves this.
18	11 6 4 31 35 14 26 21 8 23 18	The past was a better time.
18	9 29 27 14 19 10 32 21 22 33 18	This sculpture is a show og human ability
18	25 26 31 30 22 9 23 19 15 7 18	She almost made it to recovery
18	23 19 17 22 24 25 10 1 29 13 18	This pile of junk can be recycled to make something fabulous!
18	35 20 2 12 26 19 29 23 6 8 18	If only the world could switch back to using candles. It would bring the electricity bill way down.
18	5 29 6 3 33 32 22 35 11 7 18	This room looks very organized.
18	17 34 10 29 22 33 4 14 27 7 18	What kind of lit party is going on.
18	28 30 34 11 9 14 29 2 3 27 18	The lady needs a thicker cloth for the wether
18	33 10 8 22 12 15 30 29 16 13 18	try to fly by opening the wings of positiveness
18	4 14 25 5 24 29 31 7 17 3 18	This is all for me, I know it, all my food.
18	16 6 25 34 9 4 22 27 29 8 18	She  chould change her coat.
18	19 17 16 23 21 13 33 8 28 2 18	What a gentle reminder to always look for light in the dark.
18	2 7 10 14 11 8 19 3 13 27 18	Animals living their lives without humans hurting them is so important
18	31 23 30 15 9 26 32 3 19 14 18	Look at that horse's display of strength! I'm sure he will go places.
18	4 11 9 26 34 22 35 21 23 16 18	In the midst of this dark night, I see the beautiful sun about to rise.
18	1 2 35 10 24 4 20 29 13 17 18	Nature like this should never be fenced in.
18	23 17 30 28 31 7 29 9 33 19 18	The weather stays nice here and the schools are amazing , what a great place to settle down .
18	32 26 29 25 10 1 5 4 33 9 18	THIS LOOKS AS IF HE PERSONALLY DECORATED AND PERFORMED TO HIS TASTE

18	9 31 13 20 15 24 3 2 28 6 18	This picture is too staged. Put some life into it!
18	30 5 20 19 22 27 32 15 11 3 18	I'm sure this kid will stop crying and love this costume soon.
18	30 35 27 16 34 1 14 20 5 11 18	This place could be used for events
18	15 13 23 19 30 35 31 32 9 6 18	Structures like these are a testiment to what we can accomplish as humanity.

20	15 26 2 29 30 24 21 16 10 18 20	I can imagine having a picnic with a nice Pinot Grigio while overlooking this spot.
20	7 15 24 5 34 25 6 18 33 11 20	The flowers produce a delicate fragrance

22	34 10 4 3 5 21 18 26 15 29 22	Hey buddy, you're supposed to paint the truck white, not the walls. You aren't a house painter
22	24 18 31 1 16 21 20 8 7 4 22	Vegas and Mini's.  Can't afford either.
22	32 27 12 19 10 14 31 35 33 8 22	It's more effective when you actually put it on.
22	27 26 5 30 12 35 32 31 24 4 22	The Battle of the Books has now begun!
22	29 15 24 4 11 23 10 34 30 25 22	what a funny looking garden with two people staying bored
22	15 31 2 9 3 5 29 12 34 8 22	He is going to get that cupcake everywhere
23	7 13 22 3 35 24 26 6 11 20 23	Trapped in a religious situation
23	33 12 24 30 29 19 2 13 9 18 23	I hate when bugs get on my plants. It's the worst. They ruin everything.
23	4 15 28 17 26 7 2 22 6 8 23	Having to clean this up puts me in an awful mood
23	32 11 14 31 6 18 27 15 35 17 23	I wish I could have as much fun as this guy is having
23	13 17 4 21 7 26 27 30 10 24 23	This guy is going to crash into the waves.
23	14 19 33 27 10 24 21 1 12 4 23	she's fallen and cant get up
23	11 1 31 27 24 12 4 25 5 7 23	This is such a mess.
23	35 7 5 34 15 25 22 17 6 14 23	This guy will fall and hurt himself.
23	27 8 1 21 22 18 14 25 33 6 23	Nobody seems to care about maintaining things anymore. New stuff gets built and old stuff gets neglected.
23	4 11 25 14 31 16 33 5 6 9 23	What a sad looking group of people.
23	1 15 32 12 30 6 28 26 7 33 23	These blocks look like they have been into storm way too long
23	26 19 13 25 2 35 15 24 12 10 23	I would hate to be so isolated like this.
23	3 24 18 15 31 22 4 16 33 13 23	I would not be caught dead in such an ugly car.
23	1 2 35 18 4 27 7 24 34 13 23	They really don't look happy, how depressing.
23	22 12 9 27 3 26 33 25 7 14 23	i don't really get it
23	2 14 32 22 20 19 9 16 27 8 23	I see nothing. Empty like my life.
23	28 8 27 18 12 32 29 19 6 4 23	This looks like a ghost town.
23	5 34 19 20 30 14 29 11 1 28 23	He looks how I feel
23	15 25 7 28 17 11 12 6 10 20 23	All that mud, that will be a pain to clean off the car.
23	20 21 18 22 16 9 25 15 30 28 23	I have forests, keep chopping down all of the trees
23	15 17 13 10 16 25 27 31 7 9 23	I hate looking at warships.
23	17 27 3 12 10 30 7 35 1 14 23	I would hate to live in a place like this
23	5 28 17 29 19 10 26 2 14 16 23	what is he looking at?I don't get it.
23	19 6 4 5 22 10 26 28 12 9 23	I guess this would be a nice place to visit.
23	13 10 29 19 27 20 30 26 24 22 23	what a boring building to look at
23	35 12 11 18 6 29 28 34 22 19 23	I am profusely sweating and the bugs are eating me alive at this outdoor wedding reception.
23	12 19 3 17 26 25 16 33 30 14 23	This goat really takes the cake.  Spends all day with little kids that love and feed it. Wheres my love and lunch?
23	15 30 29 21 4 26 6 12 13 8 23	a boring yet calming building
23	12 19 17 18 1 5 25 15 20 10 23	Ugh. How can these people be standing on the boat having fun? All I can think about is being seasick...
23	18 8 35 32 33 25 34 16 4 29 23	If I'm not happy... why should thay be?
23	10 33 8 18 11 21 20 3 32 29 23	I hate loud, noisy concerts! I'm so glad I wasn't there!
23	14 33 15 18 3 17 7 25 8 11 23	I wish he would sit down and shut up!
23	21 16 15 10 24 9 8 6 22 14 23	This is my view of the waiting room for the last two hours. Another minute of this and I can't take it anymore.
23	22 12 7 32 10 15 13 2 27 5 23	I can't deal with this watch.
23	1 31 19 34 30 20 32 26 24 28 23	It must be swelteringly hot out there. The ground is so dusty, it looks like it hasn't seen water in months.
23	12 32 18 27 20 34 31 13 16 19 23	This shade of green reminds me of vomit.
23	17 29 11 6 7 24 9 15 12 31 23	Look at that dirty looking water... pollution!
23	2 13 33 8 18 17 4 29 9 20 23	I shouldnt have kept the pot on for that long
23	19 10 31 32 14 18 15 2 30 22 23	This comedy show was awful.
23	35 12 19 20 33 27 11 13 1 16 23	Poor bird is probably not going to make through the spring.
23	32 30 16 15 24 26 35 1 3 18 23	He is too close to the railing and they are not smiling while having their pictures taken.
23	8 26 28 11 31 35 19 29 4 34 23	I just can't take this stuff any longer.
23	24 8 21 31 12 28 34 7 13 22 23	I would be sad if I came to France to climb the Eiffel Tower and it was a foggy day.
23	24 35 28 22 15 16 2 5 20 21 23	someone like me can't afford this luxury
23	2 31 3 33 8 32 29 17 10 27 23	Scary eyes don't look good
23	2 26 35 10 22 13 21 7 16 29 23	I hate cars and I hate red.
23	24 11 3 22 34 9 2 14 28 1 23	I wish I could ride by bike, but I hurt my back.
23	5 22 7 21 20 14 29 35 26 25 23	I can never build this
23	4 1 12 11 16 7 17 15 33 21 23	I hate gold cars, they remind me of my ex. I want to cry everytime I see one.
23	33 30 4 14 1 35 20 19 27 3 23	They look happier than me.
23	17 32 4 18 5 33 25 3 20 28 23	happy life is heaven life
23	16 1 22 13 25 28 33 15 11 17 23	This picture is ugly, why even bother taking a picture of a pig?
23	7 34 4 21 27 16 19 28 9 26 23	This weird animal looks as ugly and unhappy as I am.
23	24 7 15 13 11 10 18 14 28 34 23	I will never be as pretty as she is, it makes me sad to even see her.
23	26 4 17 8 29 9 32 35 7 24 23	Everything is grey...even this orange box looks grey to me.
23	24 25 22 30 8 18 33 34 12 31 23	I'll never be able to hike like that again with my knee problems
23	13 19 2 12 4 8 33 1 11 28 23	This horse doesn't like to jump. It only jumps to make its rider happy.
23	21 32 30 16 26 22 35 25 31 4 23	Ugh. another statue. I wish there weren't so many pictures of unending statues.
23	17 25 2 19 10 31 21 27 18 30 23	I was so unhappy about missing this performance.  I planned to go with friends, but the traffic was horrific and when I got to the venue they wouldn't let me in since the show had already started.
23	25 1 8 11 28 6 9 12 34 32 23	What is this guy smiling about.  I'm jealous.  I feel more like the other guy leaning on the car with arms folded, bored out of his gourd.
23	7 28 34 5 19 20 4 26 32 33 23	This is a sad color.
23	34 22 10 19 18 31 14 21 11 33 23	she looks like she's going to sneeze there. I hate that so much when you're about to sneeze and it doesn't happen. That feeling gives me a stomach ache.
23	34 33 27 10 28 1 7 18 22 2 23	Strange how people knock down trees to build a flat diamond and play a sport so few enjoy.
23	5 26 34 32 19 7 27 22 8 35 23	Why is it so green. I hate green.
23	6 32 10 35 18 3 1 12 34 21 23	Kind of a cloudy day.
23	18 33 17 32 8 31 5 16 21 24 23	This woman looks like a passed out booze-hound.
23	2 22 24 8 20 1 7 10 32 34 23	THIS FAT GIRL WISHES SHE COULD WALK
23	4 25 3 17 2 5 28 13 31 12 23	The truck looks like it's ready to end.
23	29 9 5 7 32 14 4 13 3 24 23	This is such a depressing picture in my mind.
23	21 19 34 11 4 3 6 33 5 13 23	I'm stuck under here and don't think I can get out!
23	3 12 35 29 4 11 6 20 5 30 23	this is the worst vacation spot ever
23	14 24 18 35 26 9 17 28 11 25 23	What a sad looking place
23	14 10 2 18 33 27 30 5 28 8 23	Its way too hot here
23	16 32 6 25 35 21 1 10 9 5 23	some lonely plain sitting away from everything else doing absolutely nothing.
23	33 32 34 35 6 30 27 22 7 24 23	Everyone is celebrating some occasion but me. I hate this time of year.  Ughh!
23	5 31 28 29 24 22 10 33 12 25 23	This plant smells disgusting. Plus, I'm allergic. I need to get home before I sneeze my brains out.
23	5 35 13 7 19 9 10 2 17 12 23	This picture makes me so sad, it's too dark.
23	31 3 35 8 2 25 20 22 9 10 23	I don't have a roof over my bed. I have to sleep outdoors.
23	11 15 34 29 5 32 3 8 16 20 23	500 Million sweating, stinking bodies in close areas, yuk
23	22 19 32 28 30 8 17 9 33 10 23	I'm sick of this being my view every day
23	15 20 18 6 13 12 10 28 29 30 23	*Sigh* Yeah, great cell tower. Now please help my internet go faster than 2mbps
23	5 12 6 15 17 29 1 28 24 2 23	i would hate being on rollercosters. too scarey
23	11 15 5 9 35 1 12 34 26 28 23	This looks so cold I'm not sure how people could be happy here.
23	8 32 2 27 22 20 35 7 34 26 23	That's a weird looking bit of grass.
23	18 34 5 33 22 31 11 2 12 16 23	It's dpressing how all of these houses look identical. Nothing interesting happens ever.
24	7 33 9 35 32 12 11 19 13 34 24	This couple should not be hugging in public.
24	22 34 20 6 1 31 16 29 8 28 24	Pick that chair up right now!
24	13 30 29 11 9 32 16 28 31 8 24	I just want to take that scarf and wrap it around the both of them! Tie it in a knot to keep them together forever!
24	14 29 11 2 21 33 3 13 9 18 24	I'm going to pry that hook off and gouge your eyes out with it, you little punk
24	27 28 31 35 33 22 12 29 18 11 24	Hopefully they are not at max capacity, and fall to their deaths.
24	3 17 10 34 33 35 31 25 14 27 24	Why is the weather always like this?
24	32 27 29 30 16 11 31 15 4 9 24	Worst picture ever, what were you thinking dude?
24	25 35 26 15 16 33 2 10 23 7 24	I like this picture it have such a artsy mechanical touch.
24	2 20 27 16 14 1 23 35 19 30 24	He, and I would tear this place up!
24	6 8 15 34 17 4 33 1 28 19 24	She thinks she can control me
24	13 12 3 27 6 4 30 21 31 10 24	hope she has bug spray
24	11 6 31 27 8 15 20 23 26 29 24	An emblem of strength and power!
24	20 17 8 21 11 22 23 7 29 25 24	I just want to yank that stupid flower off its stem.
24	23 8 26 3 18 4 5 15 2 12 24	It was aggressively beautiful that day
24	27 21 4 22 12 25 23 2 10 16 24	I'm sure I could play guitar at a festival too.
24	16 13 5 10 3 33 4 30 34 27 24	I would be furious of my son let the grass and weeds get that tall
24	15 6 18 5 7 19 35 32 25 2 24	Why exactly are we feeding the birds? Can't they find their own food, that's what they're supposed to do.
24	12 28 4 7 15 21 23 20 9 31 24	I think I'll bust up this party.
24	35 15 27 31 30 13 10 32 7 8 24	Look at all these drunkards at this party, I can not stand people who drink that much wine.
24	21 15 23 14 5 10 27 3 18 25 24	Those shorts do not look right on her!
24	8 14 5 16 32 28 2 33 19 30 24	I want to attack this street with my cleaning machine.
24	35 22 18 8 26 27 14 9 19 21 24	I wanto to light those things on fire so they'll get that stupid looking thing out of here.
24	16 12 5 15 2 30 18 35 9 20 24	Why would you take such a distorted picture of umbrellas!
24	5 13 8 21 29 18 2 19 17 34 24	So many white people, why no diversity?
24	20 19 23 13 7 33 11 12 27 5 24	Ugh!  How many pics like this need to be posted?  Did you really have to be the millionth?!
24	6 15 4 35 22 33 30 1 16 32 24	why would you feed your baby dairy products clearly he doesn't like it
24	30 16 7 1 20 18 12 21 26 35 24	I'm going to tear off those stickers and put my own stickers in their place.
24	26 19 14 3 34 29 2 21 6 9 24	I bet they are discussing about pointless stuff. I HATE these people!
24	4 21 28 1 27 19 35 16 32 11 24	Just one step at a time. You can do it
24	23 13 5 2 34 29 20 15 25 31 24	She looks pretty snobby to me, I bet she's a horrible person.
24	30 3 1 5 29 20 18 26 8 27 24	Strike out again, I'm going to start yelling at the ump!
24	11 4 2 20 28 7 6 17 9 34 24	This squirrel looks like a fun challenge to try and hunt down
24	14 10 17 20 26 11 30 33 3 5 24	Ughhhh why is that guy shirtless I want to punch him.
24	16 25 5 26 17 6 32 30 2 1 24	I can stay infront of them
24	27 5 25 32 23 13 12 3 26 9 24	I love how the two women seem to hold a true friendship.
24	15 21 17 19 7 10 12 26 16 25 24	I'd go swimming here, I don't care if it's dangerous.
24	30 2 19 5 1 15 20 10 29 27 24	It started as a peaceful protest.
24	7 10 5 15 14 4 18 32 22 23 24	I know I could take him in a fight!
24	29 14 1 18 34 25 22 9 27 2 24	If I were her, I'd punch him in the face
24	20 6 23 31 3 11 25 15 5 30 24	When we hit the shore, I want a hard target search of every boat house, out house and hen house in a three mile radius.
24	18 15 32 25 14 13 2 1 27 26 24	The mountains can seem aggressive.
24	32 18 22 30 15 14 31 5 3 4 24	They are about to get beat by my kids soccer squad
24	22 27 21 18 25 10 23 11 16 12 24	These girls look like they're trying to hurt me! I think I need to attack them first!
24	25 22 28 5 7 21 3 1 13 30 24	That building is breaking the rules
24	4 33 17 2 14 23 6 18 30 28 24	I wish everyone would stay home. There's too much traffic.
24	6 3 22 15 30 12 32 25 14 1 24	Whoever that is they better watch out!
24	21 35 6 18 22 7 1 28 19 33 24	It would be so cool to break all the windows out in that place.
24	35 22 4 19 18 25 26 12 34 15 24	It'd be funny to push someone down on those hard bricks.
24	2 17 34 26 18 8 4 16 7 3 24	Those leaves look like they have sharp edges.
24	16 4 12 3 20 13 9 14 27 30 24	this place is too calm for me. I want to go climb that rock!
24	3 26 22 33 31 11 23 34 8 19 24	These tourists look like idiots
24	7 16 20 14 3 15 13 12 34 22 24	That girl is really attractive
24	28 26 10 30 35 18 4 3 7 15 24	I would laugh if he fell into the water.
24	25 10 34 21 4 19 20 14 27 33 24	ANyone who would go anywhere like this boring place must be one sandwich short of a picnic.
24	2 15 25 17 8 33 29 5 28 18 24	That guys musatche should be cut off immediately, so gross.
24	17 3 26 30 8 21 4 13 33 23 24	I would really demand somebody to repair every damage done to this.
24	15 6 32 14 23 21 31 35 11 30 24	These seats are terrible, they should've demanded better seats.
24	1 30 31 27 10 18 23 16 21 20 24	Looks like a bunch of meat will be wasted.
24	8 11 17 34 18 7 14 20 5 31 24	The cold, hard images below suggest that the town is unwelcoming and confrontational.
24	25 13 11 26 16 21 5 17 8 22 24	I hate this color with a passion.  NO!
24	19 11 3 13 29 8 26 15 9 27 24	i just want to cut all those trees down
24	10 19 15 30 18 26 7 2 3 23 24	She looks like she doesn't know what she is talking about.
24	15 28 14 19 18 1 2 16 3 25 24	How overpowerin of those weeds
24	27 34 35 7 2 33 13 5 21 8 24	Look at the background of this picture. It seems like someone aint having no happy birthday. Take that crap down.
24	27 32 28 10 6 3 33 14 16 19 24	Id do a better paving job then who ever did this rubbish!
24	28 29 15 13 33 9 12 35 8 30 24	The flowers grow everywhere as if nothing can stop them.
24	2 35 1 32 16 29 31 21 18 6 24	If these police tried to arrest me on the subway you bet I would fight back man! They need to stay in their cars not ride the subway.
24	3 32 20 7 22 9 2 21 1 34 24	I wanna chase the squirrel.
24	16 9 13 19 15 23 27 4 33 26 24	Why is there nobody there there is always a crowd there

26	35 29 27 18 5 8 12 21 22 6 26	This art looks so cool!
26	33 35 10 13 16 22 34 14 12 28 26	This music give me life
26	32 3 18 16 19 5 22 35 10 11 26	The crowd looks so excited to be there. Everyone is proabably having a good time
26	5 24 34 12 7 33 20 28 3 6 26	This view makes me happy.
27	7 24 18 35 17 34 19 12 3 25 27	Man, I could never brush a dog until it looked like that.
27	26 2 9 22 34 23 16 24 20 12 27	This is a regular brown.
27	13 7 10 25 19 21 33 14 18 31 27	i might hire someone to water my tree
27	25 5 7 10 18 15 19 13 17 4 27	Urggh. I don't want to walk all the way to the fountain.
27	34 16 26 20 23 19 4 25 28 14 27	I can't be bothered to cross the road to this place.
27	25 9 32 10 30 20 17 35 21 28 27	Red Square looks like a much longer walk than I thought it was
27	24 14 6 30 2 7 3 21 9 29 27	This makes me just want to stop doing my homework
27	4 25 18 9 29 16 30 23 33 12 27	Looks like way too much effort
27	12 4 19 20 33 25 22 18 35 23 27	I would play at their wedding, but i just don't want to walk over there.
27	13 25 28 26 3 8 4 21 9 29 27	Those doors don't look like they took a while to build.
27	2 33 35 11 24 30 10 25 26 31 27	Who needs napkins when eating?
27	35 12 15 7 4 17 2 21 33 31 27	So much work to get to med school. Not for me
27	5 12 10 21 15 31 11 9 24 26 27	this butterfly is not even moving.
27	30 33 2 29 13 8 15 4 28 34 27	That duck was too tired to even sit up top.
27	19 11 34 2 3 10 26 33 13 22 27	That's a pretty big building.
27	14 4 24 29 7 30 10 35 16 1 27	I'm just gonna lean on someone while we wait for this photo to happen.
27	17 1 20 24 21 8 31 14 16 22 27	I'd rather watch television at home.
27	31 26 3 7 6 2 22 9 14 24 27	Why am I even taking the time to comment on a pink square..
27	14 2 7 3 9 4 32 6 26 33 27	Thought about getting up and doing karaoke, but I just never felt like standing up that long.
27	34 33 14 31 8 22 28 6 3 11 27	This flower isn't even worth bending down to pick up.
27	12 30 11 20 6 1 7 9 21 28 27	Cool pic, like the cam.
27	9 2 13 15 30 11 19 12 35 6 27	good thing im not a dancer
27	18 34 23 29 32 8 1 14 2 31 27	That looks like a good way to look at the book.
27	7 23 13 32 4 21 5 2 31 20 27	I don't know what this light is for, I don't really care.
27	15 26 18 19 17 31 35 33 4 32 27	That road is way too long to take a walk.
27	10 3 26 13 20 30 21 17 6 11 27	I am feeling rather sleepy now.
27	19 2 32 29 3 7 8 21 30 22 27	I don't have the energy to build shelves like these.
27	4 1 20 5 26 34 12 24 3 25 27	This looks like to much exercise for me!
27	25 6 11 35 24 2 10 21 26 20 27	I could sit under that tree all day and not do a thjng
27	20 18 17 24 33 15 14 7 10 2 27	This color makes me sleepy!
27	32 18 5 17 14 33 3 7 8 4 27	That looks like a cool statue.
27	2 1 9 8 10 7 26 3 14 18 27	This is a great day for setting a blanket on the lawn and having a picnic
27	30 22 9 12 14 6 7 16 8 28 27	I would make her wipe her own face
27	18 2 6 23 19 11 26 7 10 20 27	I find her dressing very lazy.
27	16 2 4 21 5 30 1 12 23 22 27	Too much effort, just get in the car and drive.
27	34 13 8 17 15 31 32 30 10 6 27	Whatever it is they're taking a photo for, have to wonder if one really had to go through the trouble of getting all dressed up for it.
27	18 16 5 30 19 2 28 6 25 32 27	i wish i could sit in a stroller all day
27	16 34 33 15 2 32 10 7 20 18 27	I wouldn't have the energy to sit and have someone do that to my hair.
27	35 19 5 28 1 11 4 16 2 23 27	Nice photo but I'd rather just play FIFA on PS4, less running for me.
27	1 26 29 22 20 13 24 5 8 33 27	when you don't feel like cooking food, I'd go to restaurants
27	24 4 32 10 3 11 12 16 2 5 27	I would love to stay in this room and be able to take in this gorgeous view all day every day.
27	10 31 11 3 6 30 17 7 32 28 27	Looking forward to a relaxing day by the water today.
27	1 7 6 31 15 10 13 23 5 35 27	You can't be lazy riding this animal.
27	18 24 2 34 6 32 23 35 9 25 27	I would hate to have to walk this street - it looks long.
27	26 22 5 30 34 19 28 31 33 29 27	I've never seen such parking before in my life. The fact that I have to walk that far to the door...preposterous!
27	6 30 26 10 3 28 25 1 17 15 27	The baby looks like he's having more fun than I am.
27	22 24 31 21 15 29 9 10 8 32 27	I will stay inside today
27	15 9 11 8 14 3 30 19 16 1 27	I'd rather be sitting down.
27	3 14 22 33 25 19 35 11 24 15 27	I guess that is where you can play.
27	8 10 19 2 14 4 25 3 32 23 27	I really should peel off these stickers someday
27	24 3 20 32 21 29 8 1 6 23 27	I'm too tired to play dress up like this
27	15 25 32 22 9 31 24 6 23 19 27	Not sure how, but I bet you could do a better job of it.
27	32 31 19 9 25 21 5 24 30 29 27	uh, there is a uh village by the sea
27	2 3 14 31 32 5 16 12 28 23 27	This outfit looks like too much work, I'd rather wear sweatpants.
27	19 13 6 24 21 34 1 20 18 26 27	Today I am supposed to mow the lawn and maintain the boat.  I start with a beer and see where the day takes me.
27	13 26 8 21 22 30 35 18 14 23 27	Geez, it must have taken a lot of effort to walk up there in those shoes.
27	22 16 2 17 4 14 11 7 13 9 27	The new calf taking her time with some milk.
27	19 10 4 32 16 8 6 35 22 9 27	That But Looks Comfortable chilling On Thebench. The Other Guy Should Chill Too
27	33 18 19 20 4 16 30 24 28 8 27	I wonder what that is on her face. I was supposed to make a face mask the other day, but I just don't have the energy to get it done,
27	33 19 14 32 4 23 2 18 26 13 27	Me and this cutie are going to take our after breakfest nap
27	12 34 25 19 4 26 31 23 29 21 27	The person she tagged didn't get up to chase her
27	3 9 28 11 1 25 5 24 17 32 27	makes me wanna take a nap... zzz
27	5 6 30 2 32 4 11 12 24 34 27	I would never write on a car.
27	22 26 20 13 18 10 2 15 3 30 27	The sign sits lazily informing visitors.
27	16 11 32 23 26 19 20 25 10 7 27	Thats way too mnay cards to put in that book
27	23 5 15 19 20 18 33 25 6 32 27	I want to see a Dodger game, but I don't want to drive down there. It is too far.
27	15 12 25 8 22 4 35 18 19 7 27	Ahh, to live the life of a lazy dog. Jealousy!
27	33 31 20 23 29 16 21 12 10 34 27	What a lovely evening to sip on some red wine and enjoy a pleasant dinner together.
27	18 15 19 23 17 11 24 20 33 9 27	A great place to take a nap
27	17 10 26 2 6 15 11 32 9 33 27	she was so drunk she had to rest her head on his shoulder.
27	9 31 15 1 29 10 14 22 2 19 27	when will a man do this for me
27	28 20 12 29 16 33 26 31 11 17 27	It will put you to sleep
27	18 25 34 11 31 10 8 32 33 22 27	This is awsome tree to speculate hangin an basket net.
27	32 5 23 16 26 30 11 20 4 6 27	i couldnt peform like them
27	2 13 16 25 24 8 14 33 10 19 27	I am glad I am not up there
27	12 14 33 8 2 35 29 25 5 7 27	I wish I could stand around all day.
27	22 21 23 16 34 30 10 15 25 14 27	I don't have time to bother with this.
27	16 1 17 33 7 35 2 24 32 3 27	i make the same face when i poop
27	22 16 25 31 14 17 13 10 1 23 27	A dreary and tired looking poster
28	34 18 19 10 27 5 23 3 21 33 28	This kitty has purple claws because it is a witch
28	6 14 22 7 12 34 32 13 2 8 28	What one man knows about the train one man knows about life
28	20 21 31 13 9 4 8 17 30 14 28	The unusual textures (santouri, ney, lyra, clarinets, voices) impart a mystical quality to this work.
28	8 26 7 12 13 10 5 1 16 2 28	It must be a magical stone, maybe from the Druids.
28	14 27 22 11 31 16 34 29 20 8 28	I feel like the spirits are really speaking to me through both paintings. They seem to evoke far-off worlds and dreams.
28	3 22 15 13 11 21 23 14 35 17 28	Engaging in a conversation where you feel like you are in the right place at the right time.
28	16 1 4 22 10 15 17 31 29 21 28	Very mysterious and open gallow
28	10 14 9 33 3 16 2 15 27 12 28	Seeing this reclining Buddha made me ponder the meaning of life.
28	7 14 3 34 1 11 29 32 15 21 28	This is my favorite spot for nighttime meditation. I feel like I am one being with the earth, ocean, and celestial heavens above.
28	4 32 29 21 34 5 24 2 23 13 28	They say the old buildings there house spectacular ghosts.
28	19 6 15 24 34 8 5 17 13 12 28	i wonder if they are going to a party
28	25 24 4 15 27 22 32 9 11 34 28	Such a majestic and magical flower!
28	8 34 18 24 1 16 6 32 21 33 28	That woman is some kind of sorcerer from another world
28	30 7 35 12 24 34 13 5 1 19 28	Cloudy ward evenings in natures' golden hue.
28	26 6 5 13 7 21 14 9 24 2 28	Seems like a mythological festival.
28	4 31 13 10 35 12 19 24 8 18 28	I wish I could fly over the town.
28	35 16 31 33 24 25 17 9 14 21 28	Yellow auras emanate from those who are full of love.
28	12 5 20 16 30 3 26 7 29 31 28	4th of July is a mystical time
28	19 31 33 35 34 27 7 32 18 14 28	It seems strange but I understand his attempt at communication.
28	22 14 25 18 7 10 4 13 20 6 28	Every old structure has its ghosts.
28	22 27 15 5 10 14 18 26 23 30 28	I wonder what creatures live here!
28	19 6 32 35 17 22 1 23 4 5 28	Some say the red and grey uniforms are special colors that give special powers to whoever wears them.
28	9 14 29 26 21 34 23 25 10 22 28	A screen capture is a time capsule. Namaste.
28	11 33 4 20 25 29 16 26 27 30 28	The green there looks fantastic
28	29 8 31 35 27 3 6 34 25 7 28	They almost look like unicorns so magical
28	15 33 22 7 25 10 11 2 26 8 28	He looks like he is looking at something directly above my head - spooky.
28	5 4 13 10 21 1 15 29 17 30 28	This place is such a masterpiece and the scenery is so raw and meaningful.
28	18 11 10 20 30 6 19 1 14 34 28	Edward walked out of his building
28	35 21 6 22 25 29 1 9 26 34 28	Something bizarre about you is what entices me
28	14 6 23 24 4 16 3 27 30 12 28	There are magical plays under the stairs
28	14 13 1 15 31 7 11 12 30 5 28	What on earth is this for
28	25 1 34 15 7 2 17 8 23 3 28	Only our bodies die, my dear friends.  Your energy.. your sould... it lives on.  Levels up.  Your matter becomes a part of the Earth, and therefore even it lives again through nature.
28	2 15 9 13 24 34 10 5 29 33 28	This is so cute!  It seems as if the giraffes are about to take flight!
28	5 6 29 35 27 14 10 24 3 9 28	how did he perform this dive?
28	31 14 11 24 22 6 35 25 23 1 28	Not sure if the person actually complete the race
28	1 3 14 8 13 16 30 34 29 12 28	You can really see his aura in this photo...
28	5 13 1 29 27 2 21 10 20 3 28	The human body needs training, and so does the human mind.
28	12 16 23 21 11 26 25 29 27 4 28	So many people in such a hurry. Bright lights and bustle. But at the core, each person uniquely human with the same core wants and needs.
28	12 18 29 31 23 5 21 35 19 13 28	We are communing via the powers of Bluetooth.
28	31 9 18 5 14 3 32 29 26 20 28	Those flowers are larger than life.
28	30 6 24 2 29 19 35 1 16 13 28	The ocean in this scene is like a retreating dream from my vague, vague memory.
28	24 17 14 29 33 7 35 25 15 32 28	Who knows how people come up with these things? It is like divine intervention.
28	5 18 8 14 23 9 17 16 24 10 28	The elves blessed the snowflakes so that they appeared as lights in the house.
28	14 21 29 34 24 10 35 32 31 26 28	The smoke rose to the sky as did their spirits.
28	8 26 1 34 12 16 31 24 7 17 28	I love how these woods have a beautiful yet eerie look to it.
28	24 10 2 30 33 9 19 14 22 31 28	What does the statue seem to represent
28	31 19 8 6 29 11 33 2 1 12 28	The greatest scooter racer in the world uses sailor moon to power his bike.
28	15 22 2 16 35 8 20 24 6 26 28	The tension mounts as to who the winner will be!
28	9 35 4 20 13 16 15 21 27 19 28	The soccer player was in the zone.
28	9 19 30 29 27 4 25 17 14 33 28	We don't climb the mountains because of their grandeur, we climb them because they are there.
28	20 34 11 27 31 1 25 5 14 32 28	Two children engaging with their playful inner souls.
28	20 27 5 12 35 33 32 6 13 23 28	I can imagine a rainbow in the spray.
28	21 1 30 6 20 10 13 2 16 3 28	Something weird about a grave after dark
28	12 35 33 21 19 26 16 7 24 15 28	The statue of a fallen city and modern cities in its wake.
28	30 3 32 21 2 35 9 18 23 5 28	This soup gives super powers
28	3 27 12 8 34 30 1 23 16 25 28	I was so amazed to see my deceased dog appear on the patio.
28	15 20 4 31 18 26 7 29 1 8 28	I wonder what type of meat that is.
28	12 35 8 1 17 29 5 13 9 4 28	that plane probably goes to all types of public
28	20 25 27 21 4 17 16 10 1 33 28	This artwork is clearly magical
28	6 19 13 16 27 12 23 8 32 14 28	It's beautiful, but it's not really there, you know.
28	27 1 16 9 6 23 35 8 33 15 28	I get such an eerie feeling, looking up at the houses packed to tightly together.
28	14 2 35 11 10 4 12 17 20 16 28	The way the shadows lie on the grass seems so out of this world.
28	22 12 14 29 3 10 13 18 26 4 28	Imagine floating in the guy looking down on this
28	31 19 15 6 35 7 3 27 22 9 28	That looks like it was designed by aliens.
28	5 4 15 25 6 31 10 11 16 22 28	The ocean tells many secrets
28	10 16 35 18 22 17 32 5 3 14 28	This looks like a shaman from a dream sequence.
28	22 17 21 18 19 24 10 32 12 4 28	It's better for the environment to just close your eyes, and travel by Light.
28	34 31 11 17 25 14 32 33 22 5 28	In places such as these, we can often feel the residual energy of years of worship. It has such a restorative effect on the soul.
28	20 24 18 21 15 22 35 1 23 26 28	I can feel the spirits (not ghosts) in the attic from here.
28	31 17 1 25 5 23 10 11 29 8 28	It looks like a truly magical experience.
28	9 31 21 25 27 18 20 33 4 13 28	The great race goes to the best person. This race, to the fastest.
28	12 31 6 8 5 13 33 3 23 9 28	Such majestic animals seem magical to me.
28	5 9 7 33 31 12 21 25 24 20 28	What a bunch of good makeup.
28	26 10 31 19 22 2 16 34 7 21 28	They are on a mission to locate someone who could be hidden in the brush.
28	31 33 22 12 25 4 35 30 19 6 28	I wonder where they're running to.
28	27 1 33 8 30 24 15 35 9 11 28	These creatures are the protectors of this ancient building. They are meant to keep evil spirits away.
28	7 34 23 2 14 11 16 1 35 24 28	Nature makes me think of god.
28	29 6 3 35 2 12 1 10 24 18 28	This looks like a science or history trip that I would love to attend, nature is beautiful.
28	12 19 16 35 22 15 26 31 1 29 28	This fire thrower is so courageous.
28	32 17 12 27 20 29 1 13 14 18 28	The relationship between a mother and daughter is more than a bond!
28	5 2 11 8 34 35 32 1 30 23 28	are these people trying to contact the dead?
28	21 27 34 35 18 1 6 29 11 4 28	I predict that the man in the grey shirt will commit murder.
28	32 26 16 13 34 25 11 12 21 2 28	It's amazing how everyone can get on the same wavelength like this. I mean, the vibe is so good.
28	25 30 23 10 11 29 17 27 6 34 28	Meditating on my walk home after work
28	5 8 3 1 15 20 18 22 27 33 28	The cat looked as if she knew a tragic secret.
28	26 35 19 4 10 6 12 3 13 7 28	They stood in harmony, two as one, the same height and even coloring, only a gender apart.  They were as fated to be...together.
29	15 33 28 16 32 8 35 1 25 19 29	Looks like it's raining and that paper got wet.
29	2 4 6 31 14 32 15 28 11 33 29	Aren't there any other animals you could photo
29	33 1 5 27 28 2 34 10 15 20 29	This isn't a real race.
29	20 6 15 32 22 28 13 31 26 7 29	Off they go, down the hill.
29	1 33 6 34 4 21 26 35 5 9 29	This color is so appealing, because it isn't catchy.
29	6 35 15 24 16 20 32 13 8 9 29	There's not much to see here, the photo is too dark
29	23 15 6 7 25 5 8 1 4 24 29	I would tell them all to get back to work
29	32 7 14 8 6 1 19 24 35 15 29	I'm not too sure about the black and white effect
29	22 5 9 25 6 30 17 1 19 24 29	It seems like a boring place to be at.
29	18 15 11 20 27 24 5 1 17 21 29	I wonder where I could buy that shirt.
29	19 9 35 18 5 20 30 6 7 16 29	This place has the worst food! ugh!
29	12 33 24 23 9 8 19 3 16 26 29	Lets see that window, going by the number of panes, looks to be 3x5 ft. That would make the total area 15 sq ft.
29	26 34 21 28 22 5 19 9 17 25 29	Cars like these are so boring.
29	26 23 31 30 33 3 24 16 28 6 29	Doesn't look like a good time to play
29	19 5 14 32 10 7 24 25 8 30 29	kitchen work in a messy environment, I wish it should have been clean.
29	21 28 35 22 31 19 10 8 33 15 29	Why wear knee pads, how do they bend?
29	7 22 23 34 9 30 11 13 12 25 29	That looks like a scary bunch of people.
29	7 10 2 12 20 4 9 27 1 26 29	That is a bird, how amazing.
29	5 24 18 26 32 8 14 22 13 30 29	what is she doing there? how boring
29	15 5 31 21 6 10 27 8 4 34 29	I'd say, "put on some clothes," but I can't be bothered.
29	33 35 6 30 31 23 3 1 14 2 29	It is a weird flower
29	7 27 32 10 14 35 20 21 34 18 29	What makes this picture stand out?
29	7 34 9 27 16 13 1 15 10 14 29	This seems like a normal view out my back window.
29	22 6 12 23 20 10 4 2 21 18 29	Is he howling or singing?
29	35 10 5 32 15 3 18 9 21 31 29	Seems like she needs help putting on a show.
29	14 8 20 30 27 21 11 3 34 31 29	I'm as excited as the color scheme in this photo.
29	13 4 32 35 11 19 25 18 31 30 29	I would not have any fun at that social gathering.
29	35 2 21 10 32 14 18 22 15 6 29	That is a boring looking cat.
29	14 25 22 30 18 15 24 35 3 11 29	The haze on this picture ruins the colors
29	27 30 13 12 35 1 20 3 34 18 29	Look at the plain white paper.
29	19 24 13 15 5 16 9 12 22 21 29	The music and show were fine
29	34 24 26 23 1 2 12 5 4 7 29	These two look like your ordinary poeple
29	19 2 21 1 14 8 12 4 22 25 29	A blurry bus stop. Oh joy.
29	27 7 32 8 2 19 18 13 35 34 29	The boxes lack a variety of color.
29	25 27 23 2 34 19 15 20 11 33 29	Cats are cool, but many people are allergic.
29	18 14 9 33 15 20 34 12 10 21 29	This is so boring; can we go now?
29	27 16 35 11 15 6 24 28 12 14 29	Looking at castles is boring.
29	34 12 20 11 32 6 21 3 4 24 29	Cupcakes are dull without a good cup of joe along side
29	10 20 12 25 6 18 8 17 5 9 29	I can feel the dull wind just looking at this
29	35 24 16 15 18 13 25 4 7 32 29	Jearsy Yellow And Black A
29	8 32 14 28 34 23 3 11 22 13 29	This seems a little boring to me.
29	34 9 26 12 1 13 17 28 21 11 29	Oh yeah, another Sunday of peewee football.  How exciting.  Not!
29	26 24 30 34 9 32 27 5 25 19 29	There is nothing boring or simple about this rock formation
29	15 16 19 23 8 27 10 3 28 22 29	Dont know what to think here
29	9 18 31 21 32 22 14 27 3 8 29	I like this. It makes you wonder what's around the other side.
29	20 35 9 34 15 3 7 17 4 23 29	I'm not quite sure what I should be thinking about here.
29	23 9 11 15 28 26 31 4 27 25 29	This place looks like the most boring party ever
29	20 30 35 17 6 25 27 4 5 21 29	2 girls and one guy. How dreadful.
29	25 10 20 19 1 16 5 34 9 22 29	The pattern behind this man reminds me of a poster I saw at a restaurant once.
29	4 14 2 23 1 13 22 18 26 17 29	The trees are very nice in this picture and the water is so shiny.
29	12 13 24 4 31 15 23 21 20 35 29	Strumming the guitar but I can't think of a song to play.
29	15 23 25 16 20 22 30 32 2 34 29	The water looks calm and boring.
29	10 12 18 26 32 35 13 7 9 1 29	The street name is weird.
29	17 33 35 27 26 28 10 24 31 12 29	There's too much going on here. I would prefer something more plain.
29	25 11 19 14 6 3 8 23 2 21 29	A dreary, cold, boring day in the park.
29	35 16 9 18 31 14 33 24 32 10 29	Tech and geeks, nothing more boring

29	14 11 27 4 8 17 23 5 28 6 29	What a boring picture, there is nothing going on.
29	20 3 4 10 11 12 8 2 14 31 29	can you get any further away from the people? how about some color?
29	14 28 17 1 6 3 18 21 2 34 29	I really like the curves near the top of the building, great symetry.
29	6 14 2 31 16 32 13 3 17 19 29	such an empty and boring place
29	34 25 10 18 20 32 31 22 33 30 29	this is a nice picture.

29	28 6 10 21 33 2 8 14 18 35 29	Noone came out for the festival
29	30 28 1 7 21 3 22 2 20 24 29	everyone has on flip flops
