1	34 5 26 25 16 35 4 30 15 6	I think I'll climb over this wall and find a way in to speak with that strange looking man.
1	11 14 16 30 5 9 35 18 25 12	I would love to go out in the middle of that storm and get some pictures of it!!
1	29 34 9 23 33 2 11 21 20 4	This looks like an awesome culture to go visit and submerse yourself in.
1	5 6 17 24 31 4 30 34 16 11	I would love to bungee jump off of that taller building!
1	19 2 31 30 16 27 9 4 24 20	Out that window is a world of surprises and fun - I can't wait to get out there and play.
1	32 28 11 25 7 29 33 27 15 30	I would love to go up there and hike, and I bet you could bring some ATV's too.
1	12 33 26 2 27 25 30 8 17 35	could be gray could be green, lets jump in and find out
1	20 5 29 32 28 21 30 11 16 25	Through a glass darkly...woot lets see whats inside
1	24 8 13 11 16 27 5 21 6 20	Hop the fence and run inside.
1	35 3 2 4 25 29 30 22 6 26	I want to see lots of pretty birds in the wilderness
1	16 15 12 18 8 29 28 7 10 27	challenging, risk taker, taking a chance
1	33 12 2 20 5 16 8 34 25 17	I'm a vegan, but I'll try the steak!
1	8 31 13 10 24 12 11 26 33 30	What a wonderful cuisine! Travelling gives you an opportunity to be adventurous.
1	15 13 12 20 11 18 21 22 8 25	I fell in love with one of these little guys on my last road trip.
1	17 22 3 2 18 8 4 35 16 23	A koala considers eating something other than eucalyptus leaves!
1	34 11 8 29 24 20 9 35 18 6	this is gonna be a workout
1	32 11 5 28 3 2 9 6 25 4	Another day on the long road.

1	34 8 15 35 10 4 20 5 25 2	This mat is awesome. I want to take it all over the place.
1	25 7 32 23 16 34 26 6 17 24	I would love to join in on the game!
1	15 8 35 10 27 23 33 28 25 11	I'd love to go boating down water like this heading to nowhere
1	10 11 17 12 23 20 35 3 13 32	My hiking partner looks tired
1	25 21 20 3 7 35 22 4 14 19	Wow I wonder where they got that stuff
1	22 15 28 16 26 35 27 6 32 10	I'd love to put on that mask and run around for a day! Steampunk cosplay is something I've always wanted to try.
1	25 24 31 9 28 10 5 20 14 22	Who knows where that plane will end up? Adventure!
1	11 5 7 22 24 25 17 28 32 19	I'd love to swim and hike here!
1	30 11 25 19 29 35 5 12 4 2	There's a dark alleyway, lets go look to see what's there.
1	18 29 8 11 30 24 27 33 13 23	I want to ride on that trailer!
1	34 25 26 11 27 30 28 21 32 17	Maybe one day ill play the keyboard.
1	31 32 35 11 22 8 19 14 29 10	I can't imagine the journey the creator went on to get that good.
1	14 28 27 17 34 5 19 7 3 6	If they are planning a hike along the Appalachian Trail, count me in!
1	32 27 11 9 10 19 7 18 23 33	To start #vanlife in? Yes please!
1	14 18 10 7 5 29 30 9 22 6	You could really get lost in those blue eyes of hers.
1	24 26 9 7 21 10 8 17 15 11	Maybe he should go ask the girl he likes on a date.
1	30 32 34 24 29 27 35 25 28 18	Anybody else want the go across the water and see what's on the other side? I sure do!
1	20 28 9 8 24 29 15 3 19 30	playing sports is exciting and dangerous!
1	17 23 8 9 7 11 12 4 29 14	Ooohh I'd love to join in!
1	34 3 9 16 31 20 5 7 21 26	Yes, I will try hasenpfeffer
1	16 22 30 9 21 19 10 2 32 26	Alf would make an awesome drinking buddy.  The trouble we could get into together.
1	20 4 23 16 28 12 3 5 30 11	I bet that kid is going to go exploring!
1	15 12 31 14 34 9 32 10 17 28	It would be so fun to feed this bird from my hand!
1	33 5 8 18 21 17 6 14 2 34	what lovely scenery! would make for a great hike
1	31 7 11 20 30 5 16 27 32 35	I want to see him play in his home country!
1	34 10 33 26 25 4 5 8 11 31	You can do that whole thing in one day no problem!
1	13 10 7 29 8 24 21 33 6 35	I want to ride those bikes
1	8 7 2 23 22 11 20 3 12 13	Where is this picture taken? I want to go and explore! The reflections look amazing and I wonder what adventure he is going on? Sign me up!
1	9 3 4 14 10 12 29 2 22 15	I would love to see more performers like this that are different than what I am used to.
1	12 11 24 25 34 5 33 22 23 32	Oh to stay in this house for a month, or heck.. longer!
1	8 15 25 34 22 14 21 17 3 28	Lets take a drive and see where we end up.
1	15 33 16 6 32 17 3 8 18 12	These flowers make me want to go exploring
1	34 3 12 27 24 25 6 19 10 11	Up up and away, I can't believe that we are next!
1	31 12 10 20 33 19 6 15 11 27	See where the snow takes us
1	23 20 21 19 14 11 17 9 27 28	Let's go do something extreme with my friend!
1	28 17 26 4 16 12 30 14 6 2	Take risks when you give gifts!
1	17 5 7 32 21 2 6 27 9 34	How exciting to watch this game.
1	29 34 24 10 17 16 14 15 19 8	I want to be a seagull and fly away.
1	29 11 17 4 31 23 26 24 34 8	I really want to learn what this lady is talking about.
1	32 30 11 12 34 16 14 31 35 26	I've never been there but I'd try anything.
1	12 15 14 7 26 25 3 31 5 30	Bet the food at the weding is great! I love to try food from different cultures.
1	35 23 12 34 13 20 15 11 21 4	Sure I will try tripe tacos
1	11 6 23 20 14 8 2 22 24 9	I love seeing all of these animals in their natural habitat.
1	14 19 2 13 4 9 10 25 31 17	I would challenge him to a mountain climb!
1	35 8 3 13 32 6 2 31 7 28	Climbing over that gate would sure lead to fun.
1	5 10 3 21 22 8 26 14 29 31	Ever go somewhere and pretend you work there?
1	25 15 20 10 17 11 19 6 23 29	I can't wait to do this one day
1	25 17 7 9 8 19 3 20 11 5	All you need to have with you on the top of a mountain - bagels for lunch!
2	33 13 1 17 18 34 10 19 11 32	Psh, I've seen way better floral arrangements. I cant do better in my sleep.
2	25 18 35 6 9 16 4 30 33 13	I could have taken a much better photograph than this
2	7 30 25 21 11 12 9 29 15 23	Why waste your time on this when there are better things to do.
2	25 21 9 15 1 3 24 22 27 29	They must be here to see me.
2	6 1 26 7 27 28 25 32 23 8	This blue thinks it's such a great color, but I know I could mix an even more relaxing shade of blue.
2	3 30 18 27 22 34 23 16 9 13	I could take a way better photo that this.
2	1 20 10 25 5 8 7 9 15 19	I could definitely prepare better party favors than the host of this party.
2	5 16 27 18 6 11 31 7 33 17	This is a beautiful view but not as nice as the one from my house.
2	16 9 4 3 18 6 17 21 28 20	My aquarium is better than this one.
2	30 13 26 27 19 7 10 5 20 14	thats gross please don't touch me after picking your nose!
2	9 33 35 1 26 31 23 4 8 16	I don't see how this would apply to someone like me at all.
2	27 15 22 18 34 25 9 31 12 11	Those flowers definitely should be in my garden
2	30 25 10 11 8 17 16 31 26 34	a young man talking whilte sitting in a chair
2	31 23 30 20 16 1 17 24 13 4	that car isnt better than  mine
2	6 9 16 26 14 25 19 17 33 23	Are you serious? I could park a place better than that!
2	22 12 24 31 5 7 9 28 14 25	Red and white is great.
2	14 18 31 28 3 34 1 6 25 33	Those races aren't that hard, I could do it.
2	33 25 15 11 3 29 30 9 8 26	Green looks so good on me
2	12 32 1 11 26 29 19 25 3 4	I would love to be there to see this.
2	31 19 35 17 5 26 22 6 25 16	Those kids should be mine
2	5 6 30 35 21 13 34 26 8 23	This fireplace would be in the house of someone who thought they were really important.
2	29 33 21 11 15 1 31 12 32 6	I'm glad I chose a sit on the front of the raft. I look great!
2	29 16 34 15 5 25 12 23 35 10	The self-important and imposing architecture of the building in the background takes itself way too seriously.
2	19 7 10 1 5 11 4 26 14 15	I would never be caught dead at such a terrible café.
2	22 32 11 34 9 24 1 13 23 12	The trees with leaves are clearly more beautiful and steal the spot light from the trees with no limbs.
2	22 4 8 31 14 7 6 5 3 25	I have a model airplane that's larger and more fancy than this one.
2	14 16 10 29 22 34 1 24 12 27	I would never live somewhere this non-boujee.
2	27 23 16 28 6 18 10 8 17 31	I bet I probably could've done a waaaay better speech than he did.
2	16 31 27 22 30 35 25 7 12 5	Her dress doesn't fit her well, I'd have bought the right one
2	1 5 25 8 27 4 34 3 11 23	my favorite color..and the best one
2	26 31 15 24 17 32 8 34 10 14	these clouds are rolling in fast. looks like a storm!
2	28 34 26 24 17 30 25 33 29 19	he loved hanging around trying to be the center of attention
2	11 13 6 21 1 31 14 20 15 3	When I hit the lottery, this will be my wine cellar.
2	5 15 31 16 28 10 4 12 19 23	My car is better than some old mustang.
2	33 12 17 14 16 8 31 4 3 15	This looks like my biography
2	24 35 5 21 22 7 32 18 30 29	I can't stand how people love flowers so much like this lily. I find the human body much more beautiful. I often stare at myself and marvel at the lovely works of mother nature. She crafted me so much better than these flowers.
2	22 19 13 4 15 21 11 24 29 23	That view is alright, but i would be better to look at
2	12 28 34 26 1 5 20 21 4 32	Would not go to this church
2	31 12 17 16 18 27 25 1 30 23	A very evil looking sky
2	27 24 22 21 7 28 6 30 23 25	I would look great here in my bikini.
2	10 21 23 7 16 14 5 35 27 4	This mountain climb made my brother be so proud of himself and caused him to be such a show-off.
2	5 14 23 18 13 3 15 21 10 33	it looks good for me
2	14 4 21 5 25 32 1 24 23 19	I dont think that wasps should exist, and they should be destroyed.
2	15 4 30 1 24 17 31 5 7 23	My face painted on the wall would be better than the shadow on the wall.
2	31 18 12 28 16 19 32 7 21 33	I would fit better in his suit than he would ever
2	23 1 3 16 6 19 28 12 18 32	This Then MutantsRest Looking Better Many To Been I've
2	26 23 28 35 4 5 18 16 15 34	This place will love me
2	15 35 34 4 1 5 29 30 16 7	I can watch that all night
2	10 1 34 5 11 33 6 30 4 25	They only clear the sidewalk of leaves because I walk here, it doesn't matter who else does.
2	33 32 20 24 6 9 23 11 21 28	I have a table that looks like that just in my backyard. Had some nice scones sitting outside on it yesterday.
2	10 7 9 29 35 32 13 31 22 15	i hate skateboards. This is so lame and i dont do it.
2	24 26 11 27 16 23 17 8 1 34	Yeah I am a thousand times better than that bloke on a horse.  I make horse riding look easy.
2	18 26 35 13 33 21 31 11 24 15	I cannot risk being seen in public with them. My reputation would be ruined.
2	34 17 5 31 11 29 14 12 13 20	I could care less what that is or who made it
2	12 3 13 23 16 9 15 27 31 34	I think birds are annoying.
2	16 15 12 22 23 9 27 14 20 26	Now what I think, is that I believe these are trees in a forest.
2	33 18 15 28 24 10 9 5 22 25	This looks like an art piece of a goat head we have in my home but ours is much nicer.
2	5 30 18 8 11 26 27 7 13 1	There's too many boats, I'd want it all to myself.
2	26 16 33 3 17 30 12 18 8 22	Bad players!  I'd have scored already.
2	35 28 18 20 3 29 26 14 7 16	I bet that man is full of himself.
2	13 22 14 10 19 8 35 7 28 11	My tiara is worth more.
2	9 7 34 13 19 25 8 6 5 22	These are my favorite candy; sorry but no, I will not share.
2	3 32 11 1 20 14 7 6 15 13	I can do way better than this has-been.
2	31 3 22 1 11 27 8 33 21 7	I am way happier and better looking than he is.
2	32 13 3 16 20 23 7 34 9 30	I like how the man in the picture have such a serious stance to him it reminds me of myself.
2	11 24 18 14 3 9 30 8 26 12	Only the best for a face as great as mine.
2	10 12 22 29 21 8 6 1 17 30	I hate cats.  Who cares about them.  I just want dogs.
2	4 8 34 12 35 25 21 32 22 9	And may the best pair of teeth win.  Oh, that would be me.
2	21 9 20 31 18 16 13 15 23 34	What a beautiful flower, but it will never be as beautiful as me.
2	6 3 25 32 35 15 12 13 34 29	Of course, I guess this is supposed to be photography.
2	27 24 35 5 32 16 3 33 28 18	This kind of looks like pinterest. I don't see why people need to buy things when they could just make everything like I do. But then again, I am probably just really good at it.
2	18 3 17 15 28 29 1 11 9 10	I was the best track start.
2	15 1 7 33 4 14 32 28 13 21	I think this girl should ear her hair down
2	27 32 24 4 30 20 33 9 31 25	The camera is used to take pictures of people. People use selfies and become self-centered, narcissistic, and egotistical.
2	29 26 13 5 18 14 17 16 20 21	I could make a better sculpture that that.
2	19 30 20 24 13 11 5 17 34 35	I could make a better playground than that
2	26 10 23 5 33 19 13 34 31 7	All the people in the building are staring out at me, instead of doing their work.
2	22 11 29 32 21 12 34 33 7 19	Like this picture of the cat, I am as equally beautifully if I just had one eye in a picture.
2	13 7 1 26 3 21 17 27 23 10	This image reminds me of my beautiful home.
2	20 34 33 29 1 25 12 10 13 27	I can't believe people still go to these churches and cult; they're wasting their life away and they should focus on something better, like I do. Working and making money is more important; at least I'm more rich than them.
2	22 30 6 16 17 11 29 4 5 33	Smaller than my servant's boat
2	21 18 31 35 24 23 11 26 20 25	Can someone summarize this for me?
2	21 18 15 31 16 7 9 28 35 5	Wow, I can think of a million better ways to make a group shot. They should have consulted me.
2	25 12 22 26 1 18 35 27 24 23	They didn't think they needed a map
2	7 19 31 23 18 3 24 4 5 6	Blue only looks good on me.
2	29 15 34 16 8 11 6 28 13 14	Just because someone is religious doesn't make them better than me.
2	31 4 27 16 13 6 7 20 3 30	I can't wait to take a selfie of me in the the village square.
2	34 21 8 28 26 22 30 35 13 14	I would probably have trouble sitting on the ground
2	20 16 7 31 26 23 28 21 11 27	It needs to rain just a little more
2	26 24 35 15 4 25 8 20 13 34	That fish is the centre of attention
2	26 33 21 34 9 15 7 12 16 17	i hate this place. i want none of my friends there
2	35 33 24 18 10 8 5 9 22 21	If i was driving this car in the race I would win
2	29 24 25 20 19 34 22 5 31 11	This place reminds me of myself.
2	1 23 28 17 32 25 26 6 16 22	I only carry designer umbrellas for this very reason.
2	6 33 24 19 29 12 32 22 16 11	She really looks very frustrated, and stressed.
2	14 21 11 35 6 10 31 8 26 28	This seems like a nice place, but it's nothing compared to the restaurant I went to in New-York; 5 stars, 7 courses! Try to top that!
2	22 29 11 18 20 31 28 3 6 25	The reflection of this stunning city in the water, is almost as beautiful as my reflection would be!
2	8 32 24 4 26 12 33 10 34 30	Look at these really exotic fruit I found! No one else could have found these.
2	4 12 23 20 29 27 14 9 1 10	I would never wear this
2	23 28 11 26 34 35 6 9 16 5	I am prettier than her
2	16 15 4 22 33 13 17 10 18 26	You should be careful where you get that water, last time I went here I got wet.
2	16 19 28 3 24 18 32 20 29 22	This person's handwriting is disgusting.
2	35 28 31 13 7 24 23 34 11 16	The dirty leaves on the snow were placed there strategically to annoy me
2	16 21 17 22 7 12 34 20 11 15	I actually have a huge cottage here. Nice to have a slice of pristine land to call my own.
2	5 13 30 16 3 28 1 12 33 31	I'd prefer my name there.
2	27 33 30 29 7 9 8 32 16 22	I wouldn't go in that water, dirty.
2	9 17 24 8 19 18 10 29 25 27	He looked at me like I was below him.
2	32 1 16 30 21 12 11 26 6 27	I would look so much better in those sunglasses than he does.
2	12 13 32 24 16 26 19 5 35 4	I wouldnt need a sampler because I know beer better than most and can tell what I would like best.
2	19 23 31 26 13 30 14 32 9 20	My kid is better than that one
2	24 5 27 26 21 12 30 31 25 28	I want the thirty seconds back that this sight took from my life.
2	16 20 30 35 10 22 29 23 28 4	I know a place where there's much better food than here, I own it.
2	19 1 32 20 7 25 22 15 10 11	That feather is pretty, but not as pretty as me!
2	9 17 4 23 31 28 12 19 32 29	I'm definitely a much more talented seamstress than whomever made that dress. I'm much more talented.
2	31 11 8 20 10 18 29 6 19 24	This is the size of my real heart.
2	28 5 12 24 32 33 8 10 16 22	They stole my shirt idea!
2	14 16 35 6 7 17 21 8 4 29	have some tea at the picnic
2	32 25 31 29 5 11 3 22 18 33	I hope everyone remembered to do their hair before taking all of these selfies!
2	20 25 5 19 13 35 17 22 24 33	I am full of life and myself looking at this.
2	28 1 5 33 30 19 18 23 29 9	I can't believe people live like this.
2	13 15 20 23 3 14 9 34 21 8	THE BUILDING COMPANY BELIEVES THEY DO NOT MAKE MISTAKES.
2	4 6 33 19 25 9 27 26 31 15	If I had a face like this, I would make an appointment with my cosmetic surgeon in Beverly Hills.
2	26 6 12 32 3 4 24 30 34 35	How come so many people are always around and getting in my way to prevent my enjoyment of the day?
2	26 22 34 6 29 4 25 1 3 11	I feel my own sadness
2	32 28 21 14 9 31 25 13 1 20	This is almost as beautiful as I am.
2	12 3 26 28 5 11 25 14 13 10	My facial features are so much more beautiful than this woman's. I think I could overpower her and be better than her in every aspect of her being. There is nothing she could do better than me
2	11 23 13 32 8 33 35 29 28 24	Thoses eyes are as profond as mine.
2	9 17 6 12 13 10 5 3 15 19	I wouldn't be caught dead at a dive like this I know of way better places
2	12 33 16 3 8 1 7 29 20 21	I have a purse like that, but with cooler colors.
2	32 24 21 12 25 28 3 13 4 22	I hate marriages because the attention isn't focused on me.
2	8 32 10 20 28 26 12 29 16 33	I know so much about culture just look at my walls.
2	7 24 25 35 28 9 18 26 23 21	i would look way better in those clothes
2	17 10 6 13 32 22 15 30 35 20	i wouldn't put my kids in that
2	1 34 31 15 3 25 21 8 23 28	I was on that ride first, you make it look so regular.
2	17 7 6 15 24 13 26 11 21 25	Ugh, this is not a good enough view for me
2	6 4 7 20 17 29 32 18 8 30	The wine glasses offered only one sip at the time
2	18 1 14 30 22 3 4 24 27 35	Only I would be able to play this instrument with all those gold expensive bangles getting in the way.
2	4 11 33 15 10 32 14 31 8 34	Why can't I see myself in this glass?
2	34 24 35 13 33 1 4 30 9 16	I've been there and swam in the water even when it was winter!
2	11 10 6 21 30 28 12 33 34 18	The cats are cute but not as mine
2	17 29 12 4 32 30 15 3 26 7	the women only seems to care about herself
2	20 29 14 24 17 16 3 13 15 1	That guy's shirt would look better on me.
2	27 22 1 13 33 19 32 30 26 24	That hilly landscape sure is pretty.. but, not nearly as pretty as me! Eyes over here, people.
2	7 32 25 18 19 22 34 29 30 5	I have a bigger boat
2	27 19 13 4 21 5 11 6 9 3	I could take a better picture than that.
2	12 23 28 1 21 13 35 20 3 9	This is where you are taking me for our next vacation.  start saving now.
2	24 21 25 10 9 30 8 31 29 18	I was given a blank picture because I deserve it
2	9 15 32 23 20 27 4 12 22 5	This looks like me me on a bad day. Keep in mind.... I have very few of them!
2	33 13 1 12 32 29 25 11 8 24	I take the best photos in the world and the sun is only shining on me.
2	12 26 4 17 27 22 13 34 16 32	I can't tell what it is, so no one else will either!
2	16 20 32 35 27 9 28 6 25 12	They know they are better then normal students.
2	21 26 18 30 31 11 32 22 35 1	My apartment high rise looks so much better than these places.
2	34 30 32 20 18 27 14 16 10 15	This is the only place where I can breathe, where other people don't bother me.
2	17 35 4 7 3 30 32 23 26 28	I'm better looking than this man.
2	21 20 22 16 5 27 18 23 8 6	This kid doesnt realize it is all downhill after childhood
2	32 14 34 25 28 35 3 33 6 10	the train is so ugly.
2	4 17 6 7 19 21 3 25 24 5	I'm a far more photogenic person than her - she's not even looking toward the camera!
2	24 5 25 4 6 20 26 10 14 30	This cat doesn't look as cute as my cat.
2	16 26 8 13 12 35 6 27 34 32	The trees looked almost human.
2	14 4 23 30 7 32 10 17 6 27	I have the biggest tree
2	3 15 25 20 11 30 35 29 12 22	This is a cool photo of a bandana but my bandana is nicer and looks to be of better quality, here let me show you.
2	24 33 16 31 34 6 4 25 17 29	I have road like that on my street
2	24 19 26 13 18 20 5 3 9 8	This just looks like any ordinary picture of a parking lot.
2	27 21 18 28 31 6 25 22 5 35	This poster would look much better with my face on it.
2	7 26 32 13 1 9 23 25 12 5	That boat looks rather cheap, I wouldn't go on it.
2	8 23 20 26 12 34 22 5 19 25	I have a kayak just like that! But my paddles match the color of my kayak
2	29 23 30 35 15 22 31 12 19 25	The art really doesn't look all that great, I could do better.
2	21 12 7 24 4 18 10 20 19 17	Dumb birds, my pet parrot is smart than them.
2	4 18 29 7 35 34 9 6 26 19	I am like a beautiful butterfly, emerging from its cocoon!
2	23 14 34 27 13 32 16 30 5 20	Seems like a stupid bird that would sit outside and distract my cat, I hate them, it keeps me from getting to spend time with my cat.
2	22 23 1 6 15 28 24 19 35 10	Crafts of sophisticated rocks and stones
2	1 32 17 3 15 35 12 21 34 25	I could live in that place.
2	24 17 25 29 18 9 10 6 4 22	This should be the view from my office.
2	28 20 35 9 14 31 12 15 10 5	These look like some inviting lads but I don't think I'd want to chat and be seen with them.
2	29 11 30 20 6 35 3 8 5 15	He got made at you because you no longer accept his lies and finally am moving back home.
2	28 15 31 12 14 23 16 9 21 35	I alone hold the key to the knoweledge
2	11 31 18 13 20 6 16 25 28 35	this is not fancy enough for me
2	27 10 9 26 20 4 35 25 34 30	I wouldn't live in this condition.
2	10 7 17 26 9 3 24 34 33 6	This must be in honor of me.
2	23 5 3 11 6 20 19 34 15 9	My concerns can be about me myself and I.
2	35 11 7 15 3 17 33 14 5 22	Viewing nature is too time consuming for me.
2	12 25 20 1 10 15 32 3 4 11	My kids look much better.
2	16 35 23 28 9 11 8 6 26 30	I look so much better than this guy.
2	29 4 32 13 14 24 3 23 8 11	She is all right, but not cute enough for me.
2	10 32 25 23 15 34 22 1 6 19	She likely named the baby after herself.
2	9 19 8 30 23 28 33 15 35 6	I really don't care about the US marine, who cares.
2	11 19 14 23 13 17 9 26 35 7	i dont really like his shirt
2	3 20 28 4 23 35 16 26 5 29	The guy in black seems a bit cocky
2	11 26 35 9 15 25 17 28 8 33	Well maybe if you post a photo that isn't blurry, I wouldn't criticize it.
2	15 4 6 9 31 24 34 14 5 16	I wish I was a fireman. They don't have to put up with half the stuff I deal with.
2	14 22 20 12 24 10 17 4 25 3	Silly drawing done by an amatuer
2	23 1 17 25 9 5 14 18 6 4	This was a perfect place to stop and look in the mirror.
2	27 15 24 16 4 25 20 13 28 30	I'm the best looking in this bunch!
2	33 18 3 1 24 29 35 13 7 16	The whole building has room for only one display, one ego and only one type of graffiti stee-lo
2	14 13 12 35 4 30 32 34 29 23	A man going to a beauty salon seems vane.
2	28 3 32 13 26 24 16 5 29 15	I'm a better sailor then them
2	22 30 18 35 17 3 29 26 9 16	pictures family better a take I
2	19 23 34 3 27 30 17 8 33 10	I could have designed this building so much better.
2	11 9 22 4 15 13 34 21 18 23	This is such an old and annaquaded concept of how computers translate. I could give such a better description.
2	22 30 9 31 16 1 23 4 26 12	These materials are here just for me.
2	32 35 30 31 10 1 14 26 4 8	He walked above the rest of society, his way of governing things was far better than anything his peers could envision
2	18 7 21 19 13 14 26 10 33 24	I'm sure this is good, but I have a signature homemade wine that is far superior to anything you can purchase.
2	14 3 6 28 10 17 30 16 22 18	I am the center of the city
2	13 16 32 5 10 4 6 35 12 20	I was in charge of the lighting for this event. My work truly was the star of the show.
2	26 15 29 8 14 7 16 17 6 9	I have much nicer looking tiles in my home
2	22 12 15 8 16 10 21 7 23 35	This picture would be so much better with me in it instead of just my friend.
2	4 34 28 25 17 27 13 1 30 24	This is a drab color, for drab places and drab people.
2	14 31 21 32 23 7 34 9 20 12	What poor country still uses that thing?
2	12 14 17 10 18 20 26 5 31 34	Can you tell I built his
2	20 27 24 6 18 19 13 30 32 35	I have been on better vacations
2	9 14 17 20 22 6 23 33 8 28	Those towers seem like they were made for me, almost like they had myself in mind when making them.
2	10 11 29 28 25 6 13 19 33 12	I deserve one of these
2	11 1 6 8 23 18 20 7 5 30	I wear this hat to make my eyebrows look smaller
2	23 17 27 25 19 28 18 33 31 15	None of these people are as attractive as I am.
2	7 14 12 6 15 23 24 34 3 5	Maybe you'll grow up to be as good looking as me.
2	6 31 26 9 5 30 35 32 3 15	This should be a place meant for people of my type alone
2	5 27 10 34 31 12 18 9 16 4	If i painted these eggs they would look amazing!
2	21 4 1 31 5 9 15 27 22 29	That tree is not very impressive, I could grow better trees in my back garden.
2	32 9 17 20 34 11 22 4 13 7	Ah, talking with her friend, who could be her twin, about herself again.
2	11 10 8 35 22 7 21 27 29 26	I would look so much better than that fool with those glasses
2	21 4 12 13 7 17 30 32 23 9	I wish people would stop leaving me notes everywhere I go. -MARK
2	11 7 24 1 4 31 18 8 20 35	Yellow is the best color because it's my favorite color.
2	22 21 13 31 27 4 1 9 10 5	I built that bench all by myself. And I'm the only one allowed to sit on it.
2	18 34 26 29 10 17 20 4 22 16	Hope we win! Hope they lose!
2	3 32 18 4 26 34 29 8 19 27	All I can think about when I see a panorama like this is how unfair life is and how all of this should belong to me!
2	13 18 20 24 26 27 23 35 4 32	i am better than that tree
2	7 6 27 5 31 10 1 12 3 4	I would rock that stage
2	30 21 20 14 33 7 31 15 1 18	I know more than these guys.
2	19 24 6 25 5 22 20 1 8 4	i would be so much more interested in the bigger presents, little presents are always the worst.
2	5 1 21 29 9 27 24 3 16 22	The sculpture of the horse head was mediocre at best.
2	25 32 27 12 6 3 29 33 18 14	I am so attractive that no one on the bus feels worthy to look at me.
2	18 31 19 14 9 32 33 10 15 6	The tree is like me, big bold and the centre of attention
2	1 29 11 35 8 26 13 15 21 5	My desserts are better looking than those.
2	9 19 14 35 3 6 34 16 23 25	I painted better when I was ten.
2	11 24 22 10 28 21 35 17 13 14	I think that shirt would look better on me.
2	1 33 14 22 15 7 12 25 21 16	I could do a better job at this picture.
2	4 22 35 31 12 16 5 18 19 24	The flower looks really elegant.
2	28 30 10 31 32 11 25 22 21 29	This bird is so self absorbed.
2	3 22 8 17 15 20 9 32 26 33	It's almost in as good a shape as I am!
2	35 28 26 1 27 10 17 25 15 18	I could build these better than whoever did this.
2	35 4 22 29 6 16 9 19 5 21	"Screw all these people looking at me"
2	17 20 18 5 24 15 34 30 10 35	I bet you wish you had a great coat like this!
2	21 17 11 15 34 12 10 16 22 6	The way this driver is driving is completely self centered.
2	10 23 35 7 6 29 21 14 33 30	My pictures of landscapes are a lot more beautiful and more professional.
2	11 18 26 5 4 23 21 14 9 35	Geez, look at that biker with his arm up, all cheering for himself, as if he is so amazing.
2	11 16 24 10 19 7 31 3 17 29	Beautiful scene, it would be even more beautiful with me at the center of it.
2	14 8 9 19 13 17 12 30 15 26	These guys, unlike me, are true losers.
2	20 28 26 33 25 16 32 15 1 17	That tree reminds me of my green eyes.
2	22 5 15 25 19 34 29 14 27 4	Why can't people wear shirts in restaurants?
2	4 6 31 21 15 11 14 17 28 35	Nice pic but I take better photos on my iPhone.
2	22 13 31 7 21 19 28 23 16 32	This reminds me of the photoshoot I did last year. Many people commented it was the best they'd ever seen.
2	17 15 3 31 16 12 4 10 24 1	These pictures remind me of myself
2	27 8 14 4 30 34 21 11 31 26	I bet you're painting yourself and freaking out about how your eyebrows turned out
2	16 31 11 15 8 14 9 13 28 4	This train is here to give me a ride.
2	16 8 29 9 14 4 22 26 32 3	She should not be singing, I should be singing. I'm probably better anyway.
2	3 27 6 20 25 18 5 22 15 33	I have been in a better mountain
2	8 17 5 12 31 30 16 3 14 11	I bet she would have been a better mom for me.
2	5 11 35 8 23 16 30 7 14 24	Sure it's nice stained glass but I've seen better all those trips I took around Europe.
2	6 23 29 32 31 18 24 19 12 34	I bet I could fly that fighter jet way better.
2	27 4 5 14 3 23 30 10 25 8	I would totally walk on this private bridge, they cant stop me.
2	5 24 15 14 29 33 13 6 32 10	I always sauna, it is how I stay a genius.
2	31 19 7 34 30 1 35 10 32 26	If something is out of place. I'll lose my mind.
2	19 22 14 3 1 35 34 16 18 20	WHy would anyone have kids these days?  I guess I'm the only smart person alive.
2	27 5 22 10 16 11 24 15 21 8	I've been to nicer beaches than that
2	7 23 35 13 16 33 10 22 31 8	I'm really glad I'm not the one in the mud!
2	12 31 34 16 23 29 30 22 26 10	I deserve to live there.
2	10 4 9 31 11 18 25 19 16 26	No matter what happens, I will prevail, this is not a challenge.  It is but a trifle.
2	29 4 25 31 13 33 17 16 5 14	When I did this hiking, I didn't need to take a break.
2	27 21 30 33 17 29 20 12 13 34	I can take a better picture than that
2	20 4 7 26 28 10 27 14 3 9	This girl's hair is pretty but mine still looks a lot better.
2	3 19 1 10 30 4 25 29 15 18	This reminds me of my trip to Ireland. Mine looked much better than this though.
2	11 5 17 26 4 31 15 12 10 35	This could be useful, but this guy thinks hes the best at everything.
2	13 12 29 24 7 34 10 14 11 27	Could you find a picture of more ugly people?  I need to look at the mirror just to get this out of my head.
2	11 18 13 17 34 20 33 9 26 12	This seems like a nice room to keep my pet rodents in.
2	10 3 15 13 25 34 32 12 5 17	I think I'll have this display at my next birthday party.
2	35 32 27 29 10 28 33 5 25 1	That looks just like my car.
2	23 29 33 30 32 1 27 19 9 31	The contrast in this picture of a Sunset and a tree remind me of myself.
2	24 15 7 9 30 16 1 23 8 29	I wouldn't ever live there I deserve a better place to live.  This place is to ugly for me.
2	18 31 15 28 4 24 11 17 16 33	They stared intensely at the performance.
2	5 8 16 34 17 12 22 29 24 30	Must be nice to fly anywhere you want!

2	9 11 27 5 28 20 1 35 16 21	This place is covered in moss. I want to go to a clean beach that is clear water and nice sand
2	30 14 29 13 12 18 4 5 1 8	I can do a better job than her !
2	17 35 33 22 16 26 31 4 6 20	I tried to take a picture of the train but of course John had to find himself in the picture.
2	4 6 18 27 22 32 16 3 20 31	New York is the center of the universe.

2	10 23 27 26 7 25 21 5 32 8	I would only live here and no where else
2	7 1 28 35 26 27 15 9 29 16	Why would you think that I'm selfish or narcissistic?
2	1 9 11 19 25 29 20 23 18 6	A view of the lake from my private property.
2	27 33 16 12 13 21 17 30 1 18	not the sort of place i would go
2	6 10 19 20 12 7 9 1 34 15	The way this path goes through the park stinks, I would have definitely done it differently.
2	25 13 21 14 27 19 33 11 4 17	I'm glad I picked those out.
2	14 35 24 22 34 30 23 3 8 25	I could beat them both.
2	1 4 16 9 23 34 13 35 29 5	I don't think I would have made such a dramatic face, in fact when I did this race I was able to smile to the finish line.
2	3 18 23 27 30 14 26 31 9 24	These mountains are okay but the best ones are in Utah. I climb them once and went higher than anybody in our team.
2	26 8 23 10 31 6 5 32 7 9	I want to travel there alone. It looks pretty nice.
2	31 13 16 18 29 26 22 23 11 12	I can only think about myself
2	23 20 26 12 9 16 6 14 19 15	my car is so much more luxiourous
2	28 13 7 25 3 24 4 8 35 6	Somebody loves being the center of attention
2	8 5 4 23 11 33 15 31 9 12	I would fill out that blouse much better than that girl.
2	5 7 1 31 11 19 17 33 3 30	This isn't even about me. I don't see why I have to be here.
2	1 6 15 30 10 20 32 29 11 25	i would so love to go on a road trip but its my sisters bday so i cant go. so unfair
2	25 33 8 31 4 29 32 23 34 30	I won every match when I was a child.
2	7 25 23 24 10 6 5 35 9 31	The sky near my house is much more beautiful.
2	10 14 22 18 15 17 23 35 24 31	Iron man is always the biggest Mavel charater

2	14 18 26 9 31 32 7 19 35 1	That's not a place where you would find me, too many people.
2	25 12 3 11 22 14 24 30 1 8	I don't really care about is nothing for me my some building a stupid art and family.
2	32 9 23 20 4 30 21 31 5 25	I deserve to be here, in this beautiful town. It's almost as if nature itself made itself to be here for me at this moment.
2	12 21 10 14 8 16 32 25 34 5	So boring people looking at animals and not me
2	33 14 12 19 22 26 13 5 30 9	That food looks great but I could dress better than those women
2	34 15 10 13 12 14 8 26 31 33	i have the boss wheels
2	10 19 16 9 27 24 23 34 3 12	This entire station is empty so I can have more space.
2	23 29 33 1 11 35 16 10 34 32	I could do that better.
2	6 14 34 27 15 17 30 9 10 25	Why would you post a picture of this? Boring.
2	10 14 3 11 23 33 34 31 17 4	If I was in the photo I would have been centre of attention
2	17 26 20 8 15 10 27 29 32 18	Look at where I am!
2	30 26 10 23 4 20 18 27 17 31	blue is my favorite color it should be yours too
2	30 33 3 4 14 25 6 16 31 7	This building is not good enough for me to live in
2	6 32 3 14 13 1 30 16 10 12	They're not that great, I could do better honestly.
2	23 20 25 22 32 31 33 28 17 4	Not the cutest baby I've seen
2	13 10 31 17 20 16 23 8 26 15	If I were this guy, I certainly would not go out without a hat on.
2	7 4 27 33 17 19 10 25 18 16	This rooster thinks he can talk the talk but can he walk the walk
2	34 26 14 9 1 19 31 24 16 11	They are all toasting to me!!! Thanks.
2	20 13 12 26 23 1 22 32 3 6	All these people are here to witness  my greatest triumph.  Five hot dogs in five minutes.
2	25 23 6 13 19 4 24 14 10 18	I'm better at riding that than that guy is.
2	6 12 17 23 20 32 13 4 19 8	I was there many times before so this is nothing new to me.
2	28 35 26 24 13 21 14 16 7 3	That building could be built better.
2	35 19 21 29 8 17 7 10 22 3	My car is better than this one.
2	5 6 7 31 34 14 9 30 33 3	wish this belongs to me
2	3 1 11 14 25 12 24 20 5 32	This pic isn't nearly as good as some that I've taken.
2	16 10 17 29 20 9 1 35 19 6	This club is laughable at best.  When asked who there was to help carry my things, I was told that I would have to do it myself as no such job exists
2	15 17 22 26 13 9 12 8 7 29	I'd look so much better in that outfit than that kid does.
2	14 9 27 15 6 1 11 3 20 23	That's nothing. I usually work with at least 5 or 6 computers at once. And of course, mine are full tower systems. These probably don't even have graphics cards like mine.
2	19 28 14 18 32 29 6 4 33 31	that place isnt better than where i live
2	15 12 7 22 21 17 34 33 30 18	I would be disgusted if someone dared serve me this.
2	27 28 22 24 13 7 34 3 25 9	I am too good to be seen in some sort of silly truck like this one.
2	29 30 25 31 23 15 33 18 3 10	I look the best here.
2	6 35 8 34 9 13 3 25 5 30	Get out of my way
2	1 29 4 14 5 3 11 15 28 30	These flowers are almost as handsome as me.
2	29 24 25 33 1 23 17 28 5 9	All of these belong to him
2	26 9 1 33 17 24 20 34 25 27	not the sort of place i would go
2	14 20 24 30 16 18 22 19 28 34	The view really isnt that nice
2	3 15 5 17 35 9 16 12 1 32	I don't really care what these guys are saying since the topic isn't what I wanted to talk about.
2	25 8 15 35 5 34 26 20 4 23	what a run down old sign. my sign is much better
2	32 31 19 6 17 11 28 8 27 18	This scene is as idyllic as my life.
2	3 14 29 25 12 22 17 15 7 16	There is no way they can build a better train track than me.
2	9 12 17 18 6 23 30 3 32 33	They thought they knew it all back then
2	16 29 33 34 11 20 18 35 5 28	This weather better cooperate for me
2	28 21 24 10 32 3 1 26 19 29	Why is the surfboard on dirt?
2	5 17 34 16 15 26 6 24 4 33	He's probably not even going to get into that college, he doesn't have enough credits for graduation.
2	32 3 13 19 20 15 4 9 6 35	I can ride much better than this guy.
2	9 22 30 6 21 27 17 19 28 32	I never take a picture with all that trash in the background and such silly faces.
2	22 20 1 33 18 21 17 16 23 3	I think I could do a little bit better at fixing this house up.
2	15 27 32 34 17 11 5 24 13 26	I would look better in my bathing suit than she does.
2	15 21 7 16 1 33 6 31 20 3	I deserve this after the week I've been through.
2	8 29 22 14 33 20 7 25 12 23	I am sure I can do better dunk than that.
2	24 31 3 10 19 30 15 4 34 11	The belt is fastened in a sophisticated manner.
2	4 1 30 16 33 28 17 10 29 18	I could take him down and I'm way under his weight class
2	15 24 34 22 10 14 28 25 12 4	You can't only think of yourself.
2	23 28 1 33 5 12 9 31 6 13	My suit is more expense and fits better than his.
2	25 21 19 9 1 26 14 34 4 3	What does this have to do with me?
2	35 1 18 13 16 6 32 21 28 23	The restaurant is anti American.
2	30 31 26 5 13 17 21 35 18 27	The front door of my neighbor's home has security bars on it because he thinks he's better than most people.
2	7 34 5 32 4 27 9 20 10 1	best looking group in school
2	23 29 24 7 9 10 33 17 13 18	I'd be embarrassed to live by dingy water like that.
2	34 12 29 5 31 20 9 11 25 10	Let me tear this down, and rebuild it like a REAL designer.
2	10 8 21 26 33 5 7 31 34 6	This looks like a junk computer, I only use top of the line technology. The only thing I would use this for is a paper weight.
2	3 21 30 34 25 13 14 17 4 19	I would look spectacular on these cliffs in my new bandeau suit.
2	29 33 11 19 26 6 10 27 3 8	Pft, I wouldn't be caught dead in that van
2	1 23 30 4 31 8 14 18 26 10	If only my face were there instead, that would be an image of beauty.
2	7 23 16 20 5 30 31 24 12 34	I wouldn't do this. And that means I don't think you should.
2	22 31 11 10 27 32 9 21 3 29	I've been there before, nothing worth sharing.
2	29 19 12 28 23 18 25 5 34 32	I designed this entire facility!
2	35 19 11 1 5 16 14 4 30 29	The person who bought this cheap keyboard must not have as much money as I do.
2	19 14 9 18 17 5 34 24 22 21	Letters are sandpaper for your eyes
2	14 26 27 18 25 21 10 9 34 31	That's cute but I was reading novels by the time I was four.
2	28 26 18 19 22 3 10 25 8 17	Nice shot. If you're really interested in photography, I can show you how to work a medium format or large format camera. The quality really doesn't compare to anything else.
2	20 24 35 32 23 11 14 10 33 25	One day, I will have a statue and fountain in my honor to make this one look tiny!
2	27 23 7 35 1 29 25 3 30 16	Would never take a dog like this
2	16 14 3 17 25 13 28 18 29 24	He looks like the sort of person I'd have to teach everything to. Lol.  So lost.  Humans entertain me so much.  As they should.
2	32 28 15 24 1 27 34 9 6 31	I can play as good as him
2	1 3 15 16 34 10 20 18 24 25	this is not my child
2	8 16 22 13 24 26 18 32 28 23	He thinks hes better than me
2	28 29 5 18 10 33 4 31 27 19	Let's chop all these trees down so I can build a large log cabin
2	12 33 4 14 32 21 11 5 3 24	I need this for myself!
2	20 22 7 29 4 13 17 24 35 8	Ive seen way better drums.
2	6 24 25 1 23 14 18 13 3 4	All of these people are bowing to me.
2	28 9 11 1 10 4 21 23 18 33	I bet they aren't as good at horseriding as I am
2	1 14 28 25 7 8 16 4 5 12	I need to eat everything here and not share with anyone.
2	30 3 15 35 10 29 5 8 28 18	such a selfish train taking up all that space with only 2 cars!
2	20 3 4 15 18 35 14 23 21 19	I could design a bus way more efficient than that thing
2	21 33 29 5 9 22 10 7 8 1	After you see this, go check out my series of photos that are from the same place only more, um, better.  no offense, I just have better equipment for pictures.
2	35 12 5 18 22 32 24 3 16 31	That's just a cabin in the woods. My house in the country is much better looking.
2	10 29 11 5 14 23 30 21 25 12	they should have paintings on the walls not photos
2	30 14 34 8 17 31 10 25 29 32	I can do better than whoever is conducting this experiment!
2	12 8 18 19 25 7 9 23 11 15	guy looks like a jerk boss
2	26 35 28 22 8 21 13 5 34 11	i've been working for about 2 months trying to get my back yard looking nice. its about time i finally finished it! I did awesome didn't i? i had no help either!
2	3 30 24 27 32 11 10 23 4 31	That man is wearing a green hat to be spiteful toward me because he knows I hate the color.
2	27 25 22 24 14 29 19 28 13 11	They're all wearing such outdated clothing.
2	34 35 18 16 28 12 3 23 15 1	the only thing missing in this photo is the whip
2	17 9 16 34 15 32 8 24 28 29	Blue's the best color, don't even try me.
2	11 21 29 18 9 34 25 23 6 26	I ride on that kind of roller coaster all the time.
2	3 21 12 6 27 35 33 5 18 13	I don't understad why no one is looking at me. They are all focused on the table.
2	20 4 33 32 16 13 35 34 5 15	I'm glad my hair doesn't look like that.
2	18 25 11 7 3 31 17 24 33 28	They let someone take their pics in those clothes?!
2	19 34 33 5 10 6 35 13 18 21	Good looking boy, but my son is much more handsome!
2	28 22 17 16 27 35 18 34 32 7	The water looks so nasty.
2	16 33 17 15 23 12 21 35 25 32	I've never had to take a subway before.
2	15 11 22 9 26 28 1 5 7 34	Those feathers would better on a hat for my beautiful head
2	35 6 5 10 30 23 21 12 13 3	Almost as good as me.
2	23 13 11 9 22 30 8 29 17 18	I can believe I am standing here, amongst this landscape and nobody has noticed me
2	12 3 26 7 19 4 21 17 20 18	No one takes pics as bad as this person.  I could do better blindfolded.
2	28 29 7 32 17 21 22 10 14 8	My hair is far more fabulous than hers.  Is that even a woman?
2	12 34 14 8 25 30 33 6 20 5	That place is too bright to have any fun.
2	29 30 17 28 20 3 6 10 21 4	I SEE THE UNIQUE PATH
2	4 15 20 32 24 5 16 29 21 18	I will write in it daily.  I will document my every waking moment.  Then, I will publish it an make millions.  I mean, who wouldn't want to watch my assent to fame and fortune...
2	15 29 32 30 20 11 17 23 27 12	My children are the best children because they are mine.
2	3 23 7 35 16 24 12 31 15 26	My friend's baby is cuter.
2	3 19 26 15 29 20 17 8 28 34	The dude in the picture is full of himself.
2	9 29 28 4 20 26 24 15 30 14	Not one of those singers are better than me
2	3 18 7 28 19 33 31 35 8 24	Only the best of the best are allowed to get into this building!
2	25 15 19 6 9 11 3 13 28 31	I could make a better picture
2	35 33 15 29 28 1 21 9 12 10	What is the old man doing?
2	26 20 7 23 33 15 24 27 35 21	This ice cream dish looks almost as good as I do!
2	15 10 25 9 33 1 24 34 20 6	I would take a better picture in that shark.
2	11 18 7 12 29 26 32 33 21 8	I would never want a statue made of me if I looked like that. They should replace it with one of me.
2	35 8 25 34 17 14 20 10 4 18	I wish they didn't do that. It bothers me.
2	12 3 22 13 10 19 20 5 31 35	Too much pollution, who would swim here?
2	3 5 14 34 24 22 19 12 23 9	I had a wagon like that. I had better wheels.
2	1 32 3 30 35 6 9 28 15 5	Looking good, but I look better.
2	23 8 34 18 28 11 32 13 9 3	This team is so egotistical. I don't care if they lose.
2	18 22 10 16 34 30 35 1 26 5	They built this ugly building just to sully up the area.
2	11 18 4 15 17 24 33 10 22 35	I want to go to the little shop in town. I do not care nor am I interested in doing anything else.
2	14 22 25 30 35 3 4 27 34 11	Looks like there are no people that can draw useful site plans these days. I sketched a better plan.
2	7 14 19 13 28 12 18 21 30 5	I can take a better picture than this in 5 seconds.
2	4 8 22 14 1 29 5 19 13 31	I wouldn't want to go inside this ugly building.
2	25 1 18 19 6 9 31 12 16 3	I could do a better sign that that.
2	9 24 26 13 30 14 5 16 12 27	You don't take pics as well as I do.  I guess no one does. Sigh.
2	5 34 13 8 10 7 23 11 26 9	Not the first color I'd choose.
2	19 14 5 29 15 35 30 25 23 24	This pic isn't that great.  My 4 year old could have done better.  Surely you can do better than this?
2	10 3 16 28 13 9 35 7 25 15	The polar bear isn't the main attraction, I am.
2	21 27 33 30 34 13 7 11 9 32	I am in a band too. I am an amazing vocalist.
2	24 18 19 30 34 13 4 6 26 35	I don't see why I should care about anything that man is saying - it certainly won't have anything to do with me.
2	7 33 29 14 4 28 5 6 3 24	I can play better than them.
2	21 20 4 1 29 12 6 17 34 25	I would never be caught dressed like that
2	11 20 28 6 4 18 35 32 27 5	Just have me play guitar there instead.
2	13 10 20 12 11 16 19 3 26 9	Why is this not a picture of ME?!
2	33 35 3 32 6 17 16 27 9 23	My kid takes better pictures.

3	23 8 27 13 24 9 20 26 18 11	This isn't dumb or anything!
3	20 13 32 12 35 22 34 19 25 16	Oh, yeah, look at that safe deck, nothing to trip over there.
3	1 24 33 8 27 17 22 5 16 11	I bet she just loves walking those steps in those heels.
3	15 28 4 14 27 34 18 20 2 19	What is that, a spitoon?
3	10 34 32 12 33 25 27 5 35 2	Doesn't look like he's doing that right..
3	7 1 5 14 20 8 21 23 29 17	joking was I not so beautiful So
3	14 19 28 22 1 6 30 12 35 20	He totally bought his own personal lapel flower and didn't take it from the bouquet.
3	13 18 10 21 24 6 32 12 35 28	That looks like it will be fun to get those cars out.
3	21 30 32 31 17 12 22 9 4 27	Best first class airplane food ever!
3	21 7 32 33 28 18 15 14 26 4	This sure looks like a pro team.
3	32 31 9 34 6 35 18 11 29 17	Um, great idea, posting the photo sideways and all. Not like there's a rotate button or anything...
3	12 28 16 10 26 14 32 29 24 4	She spent a lot of money on that dress it looks like, I just hope he doesn't cheat.  If so she can always pawn her ring and get some of the balance back.
3	32 10 26 4 2 16 6 33 22 5	oh look another color square
3	10 22 26 28 1 19 21 8 11 9	A pink marker must have exploded over the camera lens.
3	6 8 22 5 12 19 35 16 23 30	Yah, blue is definitely your color.
3	32 1 11 35 26 23 28 22 14 4	HE DOESN'T REALIZE IT YET, BUT HE WILL BE SINGLE BEFORE NIGHT'S END.
3	19 1 13 4 24 27 2 33 17 12	Hello, anyone living in there?
3	24 29 7 8 1 6 35 26 23 2	It's so bright in the audience.
3	25 10 18 21 30 14 32 20 24 13	great exhibit , they couldnt even afford the whole hallway .
3	17 25 29 9 21 33 35 6 7 4	I totally bet poor people live here.
3	11 27 34 31 7 10 33 20 21 15	Totally not a vegetation pic.
3	15 31 25 2 16 27 28 34 24 5	Cute, they think they can sing.
3	24 29 15 30 5 4 16 10 20 7	Wow, if only the writing on the boards could be just a little bit smaller.
3	31 10 17 29 9 6 22 5 14 20	Well they don't look happy.
3	29 7 24 35 1 2 17 33 23 21	He looks pretty sad to be wearing those glasses!
3	6 26 24 19 29 32 4 8 11 35	I am not at all in awe.
3	16 17 15 23 18 29 24 28 25 27	Well, he seems like someone worth listening to.
3	8 31 10 14 11 6 15 27 33 21	this is definitely not on earth
3	10 13 9 2 27 28 4 21 5 16	Your face is going to freeze like that
3	18 25 32 4 29 19 14 1 26 15	One, looks more like a none place to me.
3	1 17 7 4 28 25 27 26 21 11	Ohhhh sooo amazing!  Yet another generic picture of a waterfall!
3	7 17 18 1 32 30 35 19 25 31	Oh is a hipster haven!
3	33 27 4 14 30 5 11 21 1 12	Oh look, a weird-shaped thing.
3	8 18 34 4 27 2 22 30 19 15	I'm sure they're learning great things from those exciting cats...
3	18 8 21 29 23 33 6 4 34 15	The boats are moored in the harbor.
3	12 20 1 11 15 29 18 25 28 13	Different colors sure make a crappy flyer stand out, huh?
3	26 24 14 8 30 23 15 33 29 17	I bet his feet are on the ground and that he's not even climbing.
3	23 17 30 26 27 33 31 2 28 32	these guys aren't working hard at all
3	19 33 2 12 28 34 32 18 26 7	I hope that pigeon poops on an old person
3	10 6 13 20 25 17 5 4 28 12	The bug was so handsome!
3	20 15 30 4 13 6 18 14 10 2	This is an very sentimental opera-istic
3	16 22 30 10 14 13 27 31 2 9	wow what a GREAT picture, I can't imagine it being any better if it was you know, in the whole frame or something or actually looked like something.
3	29 23 31 24 21 33 22 25 32 19	The view is a little bit bland.
3	34 22 15 20 6 28 35 14 7 10	Can the owner even see out here front porch?
3	23 30 33 1 15 24 6 12 25 17	I would hate to live there, that view and beach would be awfully boring.
3	35 31 27 25 1 14 10 19 32 5	Guess Skinny Minnie there can't keep up with the old guy.
3	1 11 31 24 13 26 22 23 9 25	Yeah, everyone just loves to be freezing cold surrounded by snow, away from the warmth of home. Count me in.
3	12 1 2 24 26 30 35 23 29 34	I bet that's bird crap central.
3	28 4 25 21 32 34 35 8 15 7	Wow what a cool bird...
3	35 31 6 30 32 24 7 1 33 14	It's a great thing that she was ready for the shot.
3	11 6 24 10 35 9 16 8 26 31	I think that her hair could be whiter.
3	25 8 29 2 14 35 12 20 34 17	Like all those people would really willingly be in the same room as each other.
3	14 27 33 4 29 7 28 21 11 30	The keys looked mighty big in that small hole
3	4 15 24 30 16 27 29 32 34 28	Look at this professional hop!
3	27 14 22 31 8 15 16 23 21 33	That's not a packed place.
3	23 29 2 9 34 7 5 15 14 11	Are you an athlete? Coz you've been running through my mind all day.
3	7 23 17 25 30 14 20 34 35 32	Sure, that's a great color . . . for a coffin!
3	5 8 29 1 4 2 19 23 16 7	I think these smiles are all forced and unrealistic.
3	11 16 8 32 9 12 17 22 18 6	Blind clowns getting wasted at a basketball game is not funny.
3	22 15 12 1 6 25 17 30 8 27	You think you could've picked a louder color?
3	19 35 11 21 18 25 9 24 7 27	Oh, yes, snow is just amazing, I love it soo much.
3	11 10 24 12 21 13 9 6 7 17	That's some fancy beer they're drinking
3	31 21 24 19 32 30 7 14 22 35	What a narrow and useless place it is!!
3	2 5 12 27 21 7 25 34 24 26	I'm glad I made this powerpoint preentation...
3	26 34 28 9 20 23 18 17 8 14	I could take a better picture than this.
3	27 31 16 17 25 30 14 6 28 12	Its pretty but I can barely see what colors it is and I can barely see what it really is.
3	11 1 33 4 5 35 31 6 17 2	The world looks like it's tilted.
3	1 2 5 22 19 30 28 27 33 10	Looks like an amazing neighbourhood to live in
3	15 11 20 9 23 18 27 25 31 4	They look bored, is this performance art nowadays?
3	31 4 11 32 29 22 34 8 27 24	The look on both of their faces are just so precious
3	15 29 10 13 16 2 4 7 12 19	Oh I would just love to live here in this public building.
3	35 12 24 23 32 11 2 28 30 27	A tattoo artist prepares to ink the greatest work of art in the history of humanity on a young man's chest.
3	2 26 6 13 29 10 33 15 24 22	Oh, yeah that is really new.
3	12 6 24 18 8 19 1 7 30 32	Yeah, I'll definitely make it in five minutes with this traffic.
3	8 35 18 6 19 26 17 27 23 15	I wonder what good those things can serve
3	4 6 15 13 10 29 30 14 33 35	I bet he wouldn't share any with anyone.
3	7 34 11 31 18 9 21 23 20 26	Man, what an absolutely stylish guy, wearing only black leather. Very original.
3	22 21 26 33 12 8 7 9 15 27	What a green yard and fluffy trees.
3	18 27 16 22 1 34 19 30 28 25	I bet her mother really approves of that outfit.
3	27 12 8 18 6 26 20 14 35 5	I'm sure this guy just loves posing for a photo after biking for so long.
3	15 18 9 19 24 34 33 21 16 2	That guy looks like a big nerd.
3	29 19 10 11 20 6 23 9 15 12	Why talk of truth when you are looking at crazy wine!
3	23 27 16 2 29 21 6 24 10 1	Wooooow a little too comfy for my taste am I right?
3	22 4 23 20 14 1 2 29 5 32	Oh yeah, definitely looks like a *great* time...
3	29 14 24 1 20 16 27 7 6 11	Wow, look at the stupid alley there. Sure looks like a NICE place to get robbed.
3	9 32 12 2 18 23 8 31 35 16	Well this looks like a prime destination
3	6 35 18 15 13 28 31 22 32 27	The cars screeched by the people in the stands.
3	21 30 22 31 24 9 33 7 20 15	Wow, someone tripping on acid in the grocery?!
3	18 5 13 25 29 22 27 7 31 11	A green square. Must be modern art, and will sell for a million dollars.
3	11 18 28 9 33 15 30 22 6 4	Yes, this doors are tall. Don't ask how
3	17 6 26 10 19 23 9 25 5 13	Really?  I turned in my paper an hour ago
3	19 25 33 22 10 6 5 27 9 32	Oh yeah, real artsy. It must be hard to use filters.
3	19 22 20 25 11 32 6 5 12 35	I mean, is what's in her cup really that important?
3	28 23 6 34 21 30 5 33 17 20	Man they are really letting children be whatever they want!
3	8 29 26 23 20 4 1 2 19 21	Any monkey can cross America, but can it find its way back to the zoo?
3	13 15 9 16 22 28 8 23 24 7	Look at her hair, its so cute
3	10 13 33 32 34 16 25 31 17 28	Don't the high tension wires just add to the beauty of this peaceful nature scene.
3	13 12 19 7 24 4 29 18 11 14	A poor section of the village.
3	1 13 26 4 24 33 5 27 15 11	These guys have great taste in clothes.
3	34 21 18 12 23 28 35 24 4 14	Oh yeah, because I want to read ALL of that.
3	7 18 14 29 16 20 22 27 21 19	This is all you've got?
3	26 28 8 20 22 7 2 19 15 17	The flower seems to be part of the building
3	29 28 34 30 19 12 14 1 9 20	Oh look, it's 4 o'clock again. Oh look, it's always 4 o'clock. Can someone please replace that clock's batteries?
3	27 29 4 26 12 15 30 10 25 35	Wow yeah let's take a picture of that amazing piece of wood.
3	25 34 29 5 21 17 1 24 4 28	Is there a reason why you're taking this picture?
3	11 6 4 5 8 30 35 1 19 24	The sun is not hurting my eyes when I look at this picture
3	25 35 16 5 10 13 18 29 1 2	how can i comment on the picture when I can't see it!
3	25 4 12 2 21 14 33 5 11 8	She looks like she's successful, not
3	6 17 28 35 11 32 30 7 33 27	Oh boy - another tree that's shape can be thought to be something else that's "soooo cool" made out of wood and tree.  How great.
3	27 4 29 35 33 16 25 28 13 1	Only if we could all be this cool.
3	18 6 15 30 22 12 16 4 34 7	I wish I was riding in that wagon.
3	32 18 6 31 1 13 2 22 30 14	Is that one of your fans on the floor next to you?
3	10 27 20 13 25 14 28 8 22 6	looks like the walls are closing in. yea thats a good time alright
3	11 24 2 6 13 23 1 14 34 5	You going out or dressing as mary poppins?  Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
3	23 33 8 7 9 1 31 34 11 16	Have to love the totally original photo of birds, sky and trees, so different and new totally.
3	11 10 15 12 18 28 2 30 27 20	I wonder if the artist was a snake
3	18 14 23 6 34 29 16 7 17 26	Oh joy, how exciting, water and a few trees.
3	30 23 16 15 5 6 29 27 26 11	Oh, sure let's show how innovative we are by taking a pic of this machine from the 80's, yeah that'll totally work.
3	28 10 34 15 35 27 7 18 26 9	Oo, a rainbow. That's original.
3	11 25 1 4 18 13 23 19 24 15	I march to the beat of my own drum, lol.
3	8 11 16 7 33 31 22 26 5 9	This looks like a 3D video game
3	22 6 11 18 33 27 4 31 29 15	This man looks very young and vibrant.
3	22 32 34 13 6 16 28 21 1 17	Glad I came all this way to see this.
3	5 19 10 29 31 30 26 6 16 25	That is what she should be doing
3	21 28 18 33 17 7 19 5 35 11	There is nothing disrespectful about this place.
3	4 30 12 28 2 29 26 27 14 10	oh look another illegally parked car
3	5 10 13 9 28 4 11 26 7 15	It's not too steep of a mountain, is it?
3	28 14 33 4 10 9 12 2 7 1	that is the biggest bikini top i ever seen
3	34 33 21 19 2 17 18 16 10 23	only a true artist could make this...
3	11 32 30 23 35 29 7 24 27 17	This looks like White house
3	19 4 24 13 17 29 1 14 15 2	I really wish people would learn how to properly use filters. Why hide the beauty?
3	35 23 17 7 6 28 22 20 9 2	law of order or rules to be live
3	35 16 18 11 21 7 27 10 4 30	What a nice shade of gray
3	22 31 24 18 19 11 23 9 25 29	This looks like a perfect scene from Star Wars, very believable.
3	29 18 16 7 6 11 24 12 1 19	Thats a good place for a bunch of locks :/
3	13 14 9 23 10 19 11 6 18 1	Oh, it just looks great.
3	2 17 35 19 25 7 26 32 20 33	The flowers are sooooo beautiful
3	28 4 11 15 24 21 30 20 19 27	I totally know what that is
3	6 2 26 5 32 17 27 12 23 11	Im sure a genius came up with something so elaborate.
3	26 11 2 27 30 17 21 19 16 4	This is a crap shop
3	8 24 26 9 35 15 31 30 7 16	Look at that guy, I bet you this is his first time playing, and he has no idea what he's doing.
3	11 5 24 14 23 35 30 29 33 9	That performer looks so enthusiastic about being there--is he even awake?
3	33 2 23 6 17 8 35 16 22 4	Way to pay attention to the game, son.
3	11 34 22 16 24 1 5 10 4 8	How interesting to see a boy playing with a doll.
3	21 25 2 32 5 15 24 17 8 6	He probably paid him to hold this magazine and smile.
3	21 32 2 5 15 1 12 31 14 22	Like I'm so sure the cleaner appreciatesthe doors
3	2 5 21 33 20 27 16 10 12 8	Seriously, make yourself at home.
3	22 26 5 16 12 21 35 18 33 17	Like anyone could eat two of them.
3	21 1 29 5 20 6 2 8 24 14	Oh, that's a creative view, never seen before.
3	29 12 22 35 11 15 23 10 26 1	oh i just love looking into pits too
3	13 16 22 23 27 21 30 19 28 5	Those girls don't do this often I'm sure
3	18 9 34 30 16 2 6 11 1 7	The guy on the left looks happy
3	33 2 23 19 35 31 20 4 26 14	Man, superman must be in the park for everyone to stop what they are doing and watch.
3	12 34 14 31 4 27 9 15 8 24	His smile makes me think he farted.
3	10 23 7 2 4 34 8 27 12 1	I bet the horse is thinking " gee, this is a fun way to live my life.."
3	14 34 8 7 22 10 17 24 6 31	wish i was here not
3	16 24 10 33 1 34 20 4 32 17	Someone could at least explain what the heck this is. I suppose we get to guess.
3	1 17 6 30 9 15 14 23 19 5	That's the most beautiful cat.
3	13 30 7 27 33 34 21 23 11 9	the 00's called, they want their twee crafts back.
3	16 15 32 12 34 11 4 33 14 19	Gardens are so useful (not).
3	5 23 9 26 29 30 18 19 8 16	They couldn't spring for a better wedding venue than their backyard?
3	1 2 27 11 16 14 10 9 15 32	Oh sure, that looks like a lot of fun
3	29 24 16 14 19 17 12 31 4 10	THE FIRE REMINDS ME OF FIRE DEPT.
3	32 11 23 2 10 16 26 27 21 13	what, they could not make another row of trees?
3	19 16 31 5 32 20 24 33 14 29	Who left all this crappy stuff scattered around the place?
3	15 5 31 17 12 26 29 33 6 34	Bet you would love to use that lots of different places, huh.
3	28 31 11 9 17 27 24 2 10 30	Give me a break, this is a great place to wash windows.
3	33 27 34 2 6 25 8 17 29 7	The best presentation ever, not.
3	22 14 13 27 7 23 12 30 21 10	Yeah, you get that mic yo.
3	2 24 30 32 33 22 31 9 8 29	wow such an awful player she is
3	15 14 5 19 24 30 13 18 32 17	Steps are so a perfect photo prop
3	14 18 16 1 23 25 2 8 13 21	I used to have an m16 and I would shoot it into the dirt.
3	32 10 22 14 4 8 6 24 11 18	This bird is really flying high!
3	16 8 20 31 7 9 24 12 14 35	Better get my climbing gear ready...this looks challenging!
3	1 6 2 10 15 12 22 23 11 20	The picture looks fantastic, if the lighting was better.
3	15 34 28 33 1 11 27 9 25 20	This is the best image I have ever seen
3	33 35 1 5 22 2 21 23 6 27	Oh please, the view from my room window is TEN TIMES better!
3	18 28 25 10 13 11 23 1 30 14	Wow I love grey cloudy skies, not seeing the sun all day and being cold is my favorite
3	28 9 26 20 19 30 27 34 7 17	Well, that is a "cute" name for a shop.
3	6 11 34 4 12 29 1 15 31 23	He's trying to read the fine print.
3	33 24 4 31 27 32 25 10 2 35	Looks kinda like a three-dimensional billboard riding on four teeny wheels.
3	25 10 15 20 28 7 22 16 19 30	Oh sure.. I'd love to climb a ton of stairs.  I'm getting my shoes on right now.
3	33 15 35 24 11 34 4 27 6 30	Whats up hulk, feeling good?
3	13 12 28 21 30 29 32 6 27 5	What type of baby screams when it is born?
3	24 20 14 27 2 31 28 21 18 35	Is something going to pop-out of the screen?
3	20 30 13 9 28 18 15 1 2 17	Oh boy, a bunch of trees to look at. What fun....
3	26 27 32 21 18 33 13 2 16 6	No I will not eat that delicious food
3	30 5 27 23 28 24 1 35 7 16	What a stupid looking blue figure.
3	11 35 29 2 23 7 26 25 12 13	Nothing like drinking outside in the afternoon with a fire.
3	33 22 35 34 32 28 25 4 21 23	This view doesn't even look expensive.
3	13 27 33 32 12 24 5 20 29 34	Oh yes, lets all sit on a pile of sticks.
3	32 10 4 22 16 12 27 9 29 23	Wow, that looks like my house back home!
3	7 30 14 2 12 6 8 29 32 35	He looks cool now, but wail till he wipes out and is covered in dirt lol.
3	20 5 7 28 18 17 29 15 33 1	He looks lost, should have brought a sled!
3	16 29 27 34 21 4 22 32 20 8	Oh wow! that guy sure looks fast riding on that cool yellow bike.
3	18 23 14 34 8 7 20 27 21 33	Now here's something really useful!
3	35 22 19 18 2 14 10 26 24 30	yay right if I eat these baked goods I will gain 10 pounds
3	23 15 25 11 5 16 1 13 32 17	Wouldn't it be nice if it were foggier?
3	8 1 12 23 13 30 4 19 5 24	Here's the next Michael Jordan.
3	2 20 16 23 4 21 27 31 29 22	Sure hope he doesn't hurt his hand holding the sword like that
3	35 9 8 28 5 25 4 15 16 1	Oh, that looks SO tasty, I love me a large white lump in my chicken skin soup.
3	16 4 21 13 6 10 17 15 24 20	I wonder what that genius is looking at.
3	30 11 8 5 33 35 34 17 14 19	If I want to ride in a hot air balloon I don't need to go to Belgium
3	24 34 22 29 18 25 9 7 32 8	You are suppose to eat it not squeeze it
3	23 2 12 25 6 24 30 17 4 29	Oh wow, what a beautiful picture of nature: a pile of muddy grass. Probably the most beautiful thing I've ever seen..
3	6 31 18 30 17 35 34 1 2 4	What erra does she think she's in?
3	21 22 9 32 23 25 18 5 20 8	They call this music, it sounds more like a cow dying
3	19 9 34 20 11 33 16 10 7 17	Where did you put the statue's nose?
3	15 19 33 21 23 35 32 30 26 16	I doubt this baby is having a fun time.
3	30 10 22 5 1 12 31 33 7 18	It's highly unlikely that the bus will be on time.
3	21 1 17 6 20 35 25 23 26 32	How do tthey ever know if this should be an important monument?
3	17 30 33 10 9 15 22 4 8 21	Would hate to be there right now...not!
3	13 24 2 7 6 23 9 8 31 12	Oh yay!  Another fire engine red classic car with flames.  That was an original thought. =/
3	35 31 8 11 12 5 27 29 13 33	Kids these days really shouldn't be playing this.
3	33 31 6 25 30 27 2 1 13 8	This woman totally appears to be paying attention to whats around her.
3	32 18 20 6 25 22 15 12 17 8	Its not that greaat of place to see at night
3	8 31 27 6 18 13 9 20 1 25	Bet that was a lot of fun in the dark...
3	25 33 10 12 8 35 6 4 11 1	Another driver who thinks their time is more important than mine.
3	24 20 12 15 5 27 1 26 21 16	God, why the hell is my beak so long?
3	7 15 34 30 28 25 20 27 8 13	What did communists use to light the way before this?  Electricity.
3	16 24 22 20 33 8 11 29 31 18	The decor of this room is sensational!
3	15 13 30 29 31 26 11 10 27 2	I just love how the tree is covering the sun. Great job.
3	27 17 23 13 4 16 1 18 9 33	Oh wow what a cute scorpion....
3	25 8 30 22 1 27 34 14 23 33	Looks like they are up to no good.
3	28 2 16 26 22 21 19 27 14 32	Wow, what a great view. It doesn't look like it is about to storm or anything.
3	33 19 16 28 8 7 14 10 27 5	i also wou;d like a photo with the important personality. who is it again?
3	16 13 14 23 19 35 22 11 9 31	I'm sure they llive in the upside down house...
3	22 19 8 28 27 14 15 4 5 11	Yet another picture of a flower. How original.
3	31 15 17 32 14 25 22 19 30 35	Wow.  Could they be any closer.
3	23 10 14 34 25 2 21 27 30 16	They are not doing a dance, its not funny
3	21 34 30 28 7 8 35 24 23 11	Does he even know what he's doing?
3	8 14 25 21 24 31 19 13 29 30	George has accomplished more than many humans.
3	2 1 27 30 4 22 18 35 16 26	That's not another pic of water, cliffs, and a tree or two.  No way.
3	21 34 22 16 28 13 29 5 17 14	2 less red eyes to fix.
3	28 21 20 30 5 24 1 35 22 13	That's not a boring looking room.
3	1 11 34 9 5 15 17 14 16 24	Her hair is amazing (not)
3	31 22 11 35 9 23 4 29 34 17	What would you know, someone else trying to be artistic with their photography. How original.
3	33 24 26 19 23 22 8 21 6 25	Looks like he forgot to turn off the house again
3	18 33 16 21 30 4 27 35 29 8	Instead of a phone get him this.
3	20 4 18 8 21 22 27 25 7 6	These guys think they've trained for the race because they made regular beer runs for the past six months.
3	26 18 16 17 21 28 14 25 10 9	Oh look at them having so much fun, going so fast!
3	24 6 22 27 20 16 1 11 17 32	So amazing, never seen a shoe print on bare land before.
3	4 12 31 11 26 5 27 20 7 35	This building is soooo ugly....
3	31 28 2 14 18 16 30 33 15 26	Watch out everyone!  There's a killer cow 50 meters ahead.
3	11 29 12 24 9 28 13 5 34 15	It is almost a mirror image.
3	34 12 32 6 21 24 33 28 9 31	Just because you think you are cute doesn't mean I forgive you.
3	8 6 26 13 22 16 29 23 9 1	I bet that bird knows more than you do.
3	8 23 11 19 4 28 31 15 7 27	N0t pretty at all who would do this
3	8 1 15 6 23 25 14 33 32 34	Yet another young athlete, obviously 100% destined for stardom.
3	19 20 33 12 22 15 26 21 24 13	Sure hope that airline takes better care of its customers!
3	31 28 30 26 7 1 14 23 29 8	This structure sure looks like it's safe and not terribly constructed....
3	10 2 4 20 5 28 1 32 17 34	I hope those kids don't take off when they raise that sheet up.
3	14 6 34 28 21 10 29 19 18 27	Pretty much how I feel at every meeting ever.  So annoyed.
3	23 1 20 31 24 13 30 16 18 27	What is this, an scp photo? You don't recognize the bodies in the water.
3	4 34 1 25 35 19 26 28 32 7	Right, the sun is setting, so what?
3	29 35 4 2 9 12 33 13 19 21	We've got a Gilligan here.
3	32 27 8 31 20 12 4 2 34 6	why are there stairs leading to open water? just jump
3	30 21 1 28 20 6 2 33 9 7	Well isn't that so useful to have these sinks so close together?!
3	20 33 32 1 31 30 29 21 27 23	This thing will break any minute now.
3	18 10 34 7 32 23 20 33 5 17	They probably shouldn't keep the lights on at night, if they expect people to sleep in their hotel.
3	19 24 21 15 5 35 22 25 10 8	Gee, i wonder what will happen next?
3	2 15 5 23 27 13 18 25 24 28	Yes of course they'll show off the awards, to make money.
3	24 13 27 21 30 14 16 29 33 34	I'm not sure why so many people are clustered together?
3	33 28 20 1 5 7 34 6 31 23	Just another relaxing and engaging dinner.
3	20 10 21 9 23 14 30 26 33 6	Don't get too tipsy Grandma!
3	18 34 1 22 16 8 20 23 6 4	I have swam until the waters escaped
3	25 24 9 10 35 15 22 27 31 18	Yeah, like the walls are all black!
3	23 20 26 19 7 13 5 11 28 1	Drive to the country, they said, it'll be beautiful, they said...
3	25 8 1 12 24 10 23 30 11 15	I bet you I could climb that building.... one handed.
3	22 7 5 29 1 10 28 17 35 30	I think I could catch this butterfly with my bare hands.  First try.
3	33 35 25 6 9 14 12 32 29 24	Is that really all you can fit in your mouth?  weak.
3	29 13 34 24 32 5 19 9 26 27	Lime green?  You could have at least made it the color of money.  Some people!!
3	6 23 31 13 12 24 5 33 35 30	I don't think these are real people.
3	35 7 6 28 8 13 32 18 19 12	I want my food now
3	25 33 27 30 23 13 11 9 22 10	Yeah, nice beach, with no actual water to swim in.
3	13 10 12 17 9 14 34 4 25 7	Why do we need a tree like that that would be hard to cut down?
3	16 1 4 29 19 20 34 35 32 13	Man she is really stealing the show.
3	1 11 23 8 15 12 7 17 10 18	how can you have a coffin not a house
3	9 34 27 32 14 12 1 19 31 8	This looks like a tasty dish.
3	4 34 23 10 17 35 25 22 31 18	I bet he is smarter than my brother
3	20 2 21 7 13 14 27 5 34 12	Ok, pretty obvious whos gonna win.
3	35 12 8 17 34 24 21 6 14 19	Is this all they could do?
3	28 21 2 34 7 31 24 19 22 29	You think she's a natural pink-head?
3	7 25 30 33 9 22 13 5 20 18	Wowwww, this is so pretty, totally the best ever, seriously.
3	4 17 33 9 25 15 28 32 26 6	That man is standing on a sand castle.
3	26 5 16 32 14 4 33 7 6 34	Looks like one the guys here doesnt belong, right...right ?
3	28 17 12 15 34 20 9 32 7 30	Wow these Broadway shows keep getting more and more intricate.
3	4 7 27 30 2 13 17 21 9 34	I am sure his mom is proud of his goofy faces.
3	5 27 20 18 13 2 4 15 10 9	Wow! That's amazing. Another picture of an old car with a big engine. Where's the class and sophistication of a new car.
3	6 10 9 4 5 28 22 7 12 1	This car looks funny; I see no difference between back and front.
3	16 30 13 4 15 25 23 31 14 18	I wonder how long it'll be before the bush jumps over the path.
3	34 18 31 14 7 4 24 33 30 1	What an ugly lopsided flower.
3	29 5 12 4 11 28 10 14 6 20	the pretty bride with a little smile
3	5 6 13 25 14 1 33 26 15 27	You look so smart next to that dumb blonde.
3	29 14 1 28 6 32 9 10 34 33	I know how to cross the street, but thanks for the encouragement.
3	35 30 16 13 1 25 33 17 11 9	Wow, that is a short building.
3	26 20 32 6 8 12 27 23 15 17	I just love it when people disturb the peace of quiet of the park.
3	20 8 33 31 14 12 4 28 35 21	I just love it when these take over my garden.
3	23 32 33 6 18 20 28 1 5 25	Guess they couldn't afford the whole window.
3	2 12 10 32 1 28 14 35 9 30	It is purple trying to be red.
3	1 11 14 25 30 20 2 33 10 34	I bet they built that in five minutes.
3	7 25 17 11 35 8 20 15 5 18	I bet they are really accomplishing a goal out there
3	17 8 2 1 29 19 32 23 24 6	I bet these people think they are really cool for having a parade!
3	5 17 26 12 34 15 6 18 21 1	Well done on the green, really impressive
3	16 14 26 21 32 31 9 6 10 24	Man that looks like some clean water.
3	7 6 20 19 23 9 1 33 5 16	That is one big city
3	27 18 34 6 33 14 8 35 15 17	Why are all the roofs red when the church is blue
3	4 17 18 6 28 8 29 16 19 26	I wonder if he was about to tell a joke he seems surprised
3	12 23 15 7 13 21 22 4 34 6	I guess this is not the new vegan restaurant I have heard so much about.
3	35 1 17 5 28 12 31 21 25 26	She looks confused. I bet she could not pour a drink if the instructions were on the bottom of the bottle.
3	11 30 21 18 9 32 23 33 1 10	Look, a beautiful picture of nature.
3	12 19 10 13 27 16 31 24 25 17	Red plus red. Jolly. Is it Christmas yet?
3	25 35 24 4 7 12 30 18 8 21	Those women working for a liquor store really look like they one too many to drink.
3	24 20 29 14 25 12 30 2 17 23	beautify picture if the water wasn't in the way
3	5 9 20 10 4 34 32 14 12 2	Oh yeah, this guy looks REALLY buff when he flexes his muscles...and that visor looks extra cool...NOT!
3	22 26 29 4 16 35 12 33 11 31	beautiful architecture only if you didnt have to pay loads of money to get inside to be able to see it. thanks for sharing the picture haha
3	14 25 22 20 32 15 12 1 29 24	This flower looks like it's been through the trash compactor.
3	14 7 17 27 6 16 15 33 19 11	What brain thought it was a good idea to use those glass doors?
3	7 28 30 12 6 8 25 22 18 32	Sure wish I could have a man like that and not know how to hold onto him
3	15 28 17 16 20 22 18 6 25 32	This is such an interesting picture.
3	28 20 33 31 26 15 6 9 19 27	Yep, just a few easy-to-assemble parts and you will be back in business.
3	34 27 8 35 22 18 14 32 20 24	Whoa, no one has ever taken a picture here before!
3	17 10 29 28 13 25 30 22 1 9	So clean and safe, I see.
3	11 23 16 4 1 9 18 31 22 33	Can't imagine pulling my sportscar into this magnificent driveway...I'll pass.
3	31 22 21 13 7 17 30 12 11 29	Well, well, well, we all need to drive a truck that wears a skirt.
3	4 20 23 2 34 35 32 27 15 5	Don't they know that this boat is overloaded?
3	12 22 25 7 34 20 8 18 6 4	These kids look so smart.
3	9 2 11 35 19 14 29 22 32 27	That looks like SO much fun.
3	2 1 25 28 19 15 29 32 10 23	This isn't an awkward moment at all.
3	17 7 16 30 24 13 11 1 18 32	Oh yeah sure, take a photo of the orange vomit sky, it's totally pretty.
3	22 26 25 35 5 12 17 31 18 33	Could it be any more colorful?
3	34 13 31 25 27 30 19 2 4 28	Wow, this is great. Just the most ingenious picture ever.
3	11 27 19 9 20 23 17 29 1 30	Looks like they didn’t catch anything today.
3	35 31 5 19 17 33 9 1 21 13	looks like a great stage to bad shes on it
3	29 9 17 19 23 18 28 25 32 11	I'm sure he's SO funny.
3	9 35 12 32 31 5 20 24 23 21	I could totally swim to the other side.

3	1 35 27 32 34 10 14 25 23 24	I wonder who taught her how to apply that make-up.
3	6 33 28 7 15 30 17 14 23 32	Looks like they got on the wrong boat!
3	22 6 25 29 18 23 32 19 34 10	The guy is not being prideful at all... looks like he is mad at the other guys singing.
3	11 1 31 23 28 30 29 15 17 9	Yeah, I REALLY want to go to the mall when no one else is.
3	9 30 11 18 24 29 32 26 27 22	That background isn't blurry at all.

3	32 33 6 35 26 13 16 22 20 23	Oh yeah just great, how are we supposed to see what's going on from down on the cobblestone?
3	1 18 7 27 4 11 12 23 28 33	Awesome, rust. Why do we want to see this again?

6	24 23 20 31 30 15 35 32 10 9	Oh look! I think all those people are trying to communicate with this pony, who is famous for understanding English.
6	25 8 20 21 14 9 17 33 3 12	I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT IT WILL BE LIKE AFTER COLLEGE.
6	8 7 3 14 11 30 26 27 32 31	mr squrril is trying to tell me something
6	23 13 1 17 11 35 9 28 25 15	I wonder where I would go.
6	33 34 16 13 18 2 11 32 9 27	This is a beautiful backdrop for any picture
6	9 29 24 35 10 15 34 5 32 8	This picture has such a whimsical feel to it that makes me want to be there right now.
6	21 10 8 17 4 15 12 7 25 1	The artist has incredible talent!
6	7 8 27 13 12 9 19 3 31 22	i can see myself taking pictures here and enjoying views
6	11 10 8 20 31 15 35 7 17 4	I was a mermaid in a past life
6	14 10 32 35 25 33 7 18 16 26	I can imagine in my head a bunch of little forrest animals climbing all over these.
6	22 31 4 23 21 2 9 27 7 14	I want to make a dollhouse with this kind of design. Tiny business dolls in doll suits going about their hectic days.
6	10 4 14 27 7 24 21 19 1 13	Seems to be a lively conference
6	22 33 20 28 15 25 29 21 34 32	I can just make out all the nice shapes in the sky, I could see a dragon and a pig.
6	2 10 23 3 18 28 20 16 29 14	they should use light up roads!
6	12 30 35 24 25 15 19 23 11 31	Delocted than white sand itself the footprints were unheeled smoothly
6	35 23 30 1 19 26 25 13 7 17	That church must have been made for a king!
6	17 23 24 20 2 11 10 26 35 28	I think a fairy family will certainly enjoy using this wrapper as roof for their homes, provided they don't have to fight with the earth worm people for them!
6	33 32 1 24 14 30 27 29 11 7	This looks like a fairytale!
6	33 7 26 10 23 19 27 15 21 14	I wonder where this is taking place? It looks like great weather for cycling!
6	16 5 32 33 26 15 28 7 1 9	I can see mountains and clouds as if it's really there!
6	16 15 35 20 27 30 21 12 17 26	This couple is straight from a fairy tale!
6	23 11 34 21 16 31 3 32 5 1	This room is awesome! I wonder who planned it?
6	8 33 10 21 2 9 22 25 27 30	Plot twist: Those two are madly in love and this tackle is an expression of it.
6	35 4 15 27 10 24 30 32 18 23	I cannot see the girl's whole face, but I am thinking she has brown eyes and long eyelashes
6	3 15 21 26 31 32 25 7 9 22	Can just imagine sailing here on a cruise someday with my husband to be and our future kids
6	22 17 11 16 35 29 2 24 30 31	You should crash a Renaissance Faire dressed like that.
6	27 34 20 31 10 8 7 25 23 22	I designed this specifically to save energy.
6	7 9 1 24 4 23 16 11 21 3	Just think, native americans used to live out here
6	25 18 13 2 15 5 10 16 26 22	that is very colorful and pretty even if I cant read it
6	27 25 29 24 11 18 12 19 21 1	Almost looks like a golden horse
6	9 25 17 19 21 2 15 24 8 31	Grab me some beach ball sized coconuts while you are up there
6	34 30 32 8 15 19 20 33 1 16	The man second left from the middle is confused that there is no coffee on the table.
6	31 2 29 18 32 34 7 20 4 27	That plaid shirt reminds me of lumberjacks I've seen back in the day.
6	18 11 24 13 15 3 31 33 14 23	Cool shot of a glass in the rain
6	2 24 5 25 19 15 12 1 31 28	I bet this gentleman is enjoying the weather outside, it must be a billion degrees out.
6	16 33 10 35 8 5 3 28 17 15	The fantastic food dish that must have come from this cutting prep
6	16 27 25 9 7 32 17 29 31 23	Its amazing to think just how much this teacher has experienced to deliver this presentation
6	19 4 16 3 20 13 12 27 33 30	Let's all watch this latern rise into the air and bump the ceiling!  Release it to the outside world, let it soar!!
6	29 34 10 26 14 23 27 22 7 15	I wonder what type of music he plays..
6	9 33 27 18 34 15 25 22 14 31	Aww yes the collection of Bond's less impressive car collection
6	19 15 14 10 23 22 21 11 32 17	A yellow orb glides into a basket woven of chain
6	13 18 25 28 19 16 23 9 20 17	I wonder why they're listening so intently?
6	16 10 14 19 13 7 35 2 33 29	I would love to float away
6	24 23 21 13 34 4 9 15 28 16	Three generations of Wayne State fans. Yup, you read that correctly.
6	4 23 9 11 7 34 19 1 18 28	She reminds me of the girl from 4 non blondes.  I'm instantly back in time.
6	23 31 28 9 10 27 5 20 17 35	Wonder what those people are up to? I want in!
6	28 9 30 7 12 3 11 13 23 8	This old church would be perfect setting for a religious, small wedding!
6	15 30 32 33 16 7 11 20 8 24	I love the swath of colors, almost as if a rainbow was imminent.
6	29 32 8 33 1 16 22 12 24 27	Edgar Allen Poe would find this picture deeply moving.
6	33 24 4 20 9 30 14 31 17 1	Wow, all this from a bulb?
6	19 28 9 34 5 14 3 12 17 10	When the children see a bubble never pop, they start to wonder at the reality of their reality.  Soon the 'bubble' will roll to the side and the tiny dragon will flutter out from underneath.  It is glorious to see their faces when that happens!
6	12 16 18 34 32 10 2 5 4 33	This almost looks like it's a part of a robot!
6	8 9 34 28 2 22 15 31 1 20	I bet this biker is going on a journey that will turn out to be so fun and memorable!
6	27 31 18 14 1 25 9 16 15 22	Why do animals with no understanding of what is going on think as fireworks explode in the sky?
6	20 29 23 30 16 28 21 8 13 12	I bet my bike could fit through this tiny space.
6	10 4 22 1 24 3 35 7 30 11	My mind is already in a place just like this.
6	5 27 34 28 18 9 2 10 35 33	Imagine the view of the world at this spot
6	1 29 25 30 5 13 15 17 24 14	I would try to make bubble shapes!
6	32 21 8 20 35 19 3 34 33 30	This color would look great in my kitchen
6	18 16 24 19 13 8 14 26 22 1	Just after this photo was taken the bluetooth in his ear sprouted wings and he flew off into the sunset.
6	12 24 34 4 13 26 10 16 22 1	Lady is reminiscing of the days when her daughter in the back was as small as this doll
6	22 3 14 24 11 26 1 8 29 4	Can you see the fish tail?
6	19 4 18 23 26 9 16 20 5 14	It looks like that flooring is telling an epic story of a battle!
6	31 2 23 28 24 15 3 1 7 4	I can picture myself fishing here.
6	19 15 18 24 4 10 21 20 3 17	I wonder where that sticker came from?
6	14 5 25 27 19 9 32 8 11 28	This water will give me arms instead of wings!
6	23 3 34 22 2 9 14 17 13 21	Jack's new drinking game is going down well.
6	16 31 12 25 33 20 34 21 3 11	The coral reef reminds me of a distant space nebula, exploding with color.
6	32 12 23 25 18 21 3 7 29 17	I could grow and eat so many different vegetables with a garden like that.
6	12 19 29 18 10 11 23 24 14 5	I think the cat is creating an application that will force humanity into slavery to it's feline companions.
6	13 24 31 3 34 18 21 22 12 33	COME AS YOU ARE!! These kids Freaking ROCKED IT! Soon after this pic, they all levitated a few inches off their seats while singing Dido!
6	5 31 8 3 33 32 1 11 35 29	The dream is as diverse as the people.
6	22 35 21 8 27 2 14 15 28 33	I really wonder what's going on here...
6	13 25 33 1 12 18 8 22 9 32	The color scheme here is great.
6	35 27 18 34 21 25 33 7 5 22	I think this building is going to last forever!
6	24 29 21 13 34 2 9 19 1 22	It's like someone took a trip to another world. The ocean looks so alien at dusk.
6	25 22 23 21 13 11 34 35 15 32	The bean stock will be sure to spring out of this garden where I will surely find my fortune.
6	24 5 27 35 34 16 17 32 30 33	This man could save the world
6	34 2 28 8 11 33 20 26 21 27	This is the building the Minister of Dinosaurs works at. He's heir to a baked bean empire so he really doesn't have to work, but it keeps him busy.
6	35 15 4 11 10 31 9 32 30 18	He probably takes some amazing photos.
6	21 29 7 27 32 19 15 22 3 34	This is the trail the reindeer follow when Santa comes.
6	7 18 11 20 28 19 22 26 30 25	She is holding her arm because she just got a tattoo of Minnie Mouse
6	21 7 8 11 2 9 5 17 3 32	This is the perfect place for a daydream!
6	18 21 28 10 23 29 7 34 26 3	I am going on a journey; destination unknown. What will I find, and where will I go.
6	13 34 17 15 25 9 27 11 29 16	I would love to live in one of the rooms upstairs.  Just watching people go buy, and pondering their stories.
6	9 25 34 5 18 14 8 32 4 15	I'd like to see those "ladies" form a supergroup.
6	14 13 11 30 8 15 28 35 25 17	It's crazy to image what arctic war was like. The harsh winds whipping across the battlefield and the cracks of gunfire echoing for miles.
6	23 25 34 29 26 21 12 31 30 17	I wonder what kind of shops you can find on that street? Looks like the kind of place you could find an art studio!
6	25 12 21 10 14 17 33 23 32 30	this is a long road to a snowy mountain through what appears to be a desert.
6	4 1 26 17 5 20 8 30 15 34	This color reminds me of a spring day!
6	13 20 15 1 14 3 19 31 26 25	Such a cute dog. I bet he's a good boy!
6	28 13 7 11 2 9 19 15 31 30	What an inquisitive, little child.
6	11 26 22 33 13 32 12 5 3 7	Imagine these same plants growing many lightyears away on a planet yet uninhabited by Earth's creatures. So much out there to see.
6	5 17 22 24 34 32 9 30 21 14	If you attach some more lights and an above the hood exhaust, you easily take this jeep off-roading across the country.
6	15 9 29 14 7 35 31 33 23 19	If I were 25 years younger, this would be my car.
6	25 21 1 26 19 7 14 34 3 35	Wonder if that hole leads to Narnia?
6	19 29 8 7 27 23 12 28 20 2	I picture myself out on that lake dreaming about all my tomorrows.
6	8 19 12 4 28 5 26 9 25 34	I wonder if they are watching a fireworks show.
6	26 9 3 33 11 15 7 21 16 31	I wonder how the owner has modified this car.
6	5 1 11 10 28 15 31 32 21 12	The fireworks make me think about the future.
6	34 11 13 4 27 3 33 24 9 12	I wanna visit this deserted island, I'm sure there's treasure hidden!
6	33 8 22 28 20 11 12 15 30 10	Maybe he's ziplining over a lava pit, or one full of crocodiles and snakes!
6	13 10 4 30 22 14 18 35 3 29	I think this looks like a big Lego game.
6	31 11 9 30 24 32 8 4 2 12	Since we are all down here let's pray that the ball magically rises in the air to the winning goal
6	10 15 8 30 32 31 13 1 20 23	Tom is always outside walking in thin air!
6	1 17 13 22 30 26 23 31 21 9	She looks like the Wendy's gal.
6	27 35 11 12 21 1 4 17 26 22	Wouldn't it be cool if the spider was five feet tall?
6	13 32 33 11 30 26 3 8 14 21	It'd be cool if this were on an airplane!
6	27 28 21 8 15 33 9 35 1 7	Looks succulent. I bet it tastes heavenly.
6	34 26 32 2 28 17 4 10 21 3	The sky looks like a soft velvet blanket being folded gently over a sleeping babe
6	25 23 31 15 11 32 2 35 24 4	Looks like a humble place to have a wedding.
6	1 31 15 19 35 22 21 26 20 30	The starfish take the stage and perform their rendition of the little mermaid.
6	15 12 13 9 29 34 21 25 28 7	I feel like these two had a great childhood together. They look like sisters that would be best friends.
6	25 33 7 10 12 19 2 29 4 34	I'd love to see the train travel through different places such as canyons, the beach, and also mountains.
6	34 21 25 28 24 14 11 29 27 2	I think i could turn this into a time machine.
6	25 8 13 24 27 3 17 30 10 21	I Imagine those chairs are quality and very durable.
6	15 2 19 5 10 16 1 18 11 17	I think we should do a round robin pairing for the dancing
6	28 29 33 17 31 34 27 30 23 18	I wonder how cool it would be to go inside that castle lookingbuilding! Its probably magical.
6	2 30 23 29 27 25 9 13 24 35	We can race to the moon!
6	34 12 20 11 17 10 24 16 27 7	I wonder what would happen if the building grew.
6	31 17 16 22 26 11 10 2 7 28	The color blue fills me with wonder.
6	30 11 27 35 21 34 16 31 24 1	Seeing this reminds me so much of old school cartoons such as Fantasia!
6	22 16 9 27 21 30 32 33 20 12	You know a male hula hoop team that is not related to the circus place, would make great money.
6	20 22 26 15 21 27 2 18 35 7	I wonder what kind of stuff happened here.
6	20 2 16 22 21 3 5 32 14 34	What if there was a city near to this open field of land. Zebras near the city?
6	26 34 14 29 17 33 23 20 16 7	Marriage is just a symbol of "forever" the ritualistic aspect of it means nothing.
6	34 22 4 21 25 30 31 10 9 35	I would change this store background for a Cyberpunk city and make it los futuristic.
6	21 13 28 7 8 34 33 25 15 32	Imagine there were no colors, but we can make them up and re organize color life as we know it.
6	21 34 29 35 10 23 31 17 8 14	Is it dawn or dusk ?
6	4 14 24 22 31 25 26 5 2 13	This is so creepy.  I think something is going to crawl out of there.
6	19 20 23 5 26 21 12 8 2 17	I bet that floor would look fantastic when refinished
6	25 24 1 11 9 16 12 7 18 2	I bet he is flying to save the world from the alien invasion!
6	35 2 10 34 29 17 25 22 24 23	This is somewhere where the Loch Ness monster would be.
6	29 24 28 10 31 25 12 13 35 22	It looks prehistoric.  I can almost see dinosaurs running around here.

6	9 23 12 14 13 3 7 22 31 4	A panda is sitting on a chair, possible it's for a parade.

6	14 29 18 30 35 9 16 3 10 34	This would make a lovely bath house
6	1 17 26 7 9 20 32 11 13 12	I hope that one day my fruit stand is able to reach the size and success of one like this one.
6	7 23 11 33 3 13 32 31 18 1	I would love to be able to play hide and seek there.  Think of all of the hiding spots.
6	7 21 19 1 34 10 13 14 9 32	The crowd is waiting for the Prince and Princess to arrive on the chariot.
6	24 29 33 12 31 35 22 27 19 34	I know if I can get a blue car all my dreams will come ture.
6	5 20 30 32 17 10 16 22 14 8	There are so many unseen stories happening beneath the water.
6	5 16 15 29 30 10 3 7 20 28	Because of the contrasting white and pink combination, this flower would be well received in any bouquet.
6	1 12 26 17 33 16 24 4 15 9	I could do so much to give that room a beautiful, modern update!

6	19 8 16 21 5 34 35 3 25 27	I like to think that man matched his tie with that clock.
6	35 20 15 12 30 8 29 25 17 3	I wonder what she thinks about those glasses.
6	12 20 26 7 8 35 27 5 32 22	I hope that is not a snake!
6	25 17 4 26 32 8 18 23 28 33	I bet they are going to grandma's house.

6	8 27 29 16 20 28 22 34 14 31	Once upon a time, there lived a troll in a mountain...

7	2 18 17 3 16 14 4 19 28 22	I'm sure this cost me a lot of money.
7	28 8 21 6 29 30 3 33 12 34	I would have probably taken this picture from a wider angle, pointing toward the outfield...
7	21 31 15 1 5 35 4 18 14 34	I'm too good for Public Transportation
7	16 26 6 4 22 13 8 17 32 31	I would never allow it to get that dark outside of my house - I have many, many street lamps.
7	25 18 29 10 28 9 26 27 5 30	Too much editing for just a fruit
7	31 11 5 33 8 15 2 20 32 28	That guy clearly doesn't know how to pilot a boat.

7	28 1 10 16 5 17 6 32 11 3	I can't stand people that try to constantly show off
7	13 35 26 18 5 6 24 12 14 16	That's a nice camping chair, but not as good as the one I designed, which reclines.
7	29 31 12 30 14 32 13 19 17 20	ugh, look at those patches in the grass. If this was my property it wood look so much nicer.
7	18 28 17 9 26 33 1 13 21 2	I could take a better picture of that whale.

7	5 25 19 27 4 6 16 12 11 2	I could do a better job
7	35 17 26 24 28 23 10 29 19 8	There is nothing of interest here

7	19 18 17 20 23 1 9 30 31 2	I bet somebody took this picture and thought it was experimental photography. In reality it looks like nothing!

7	34 35 33 19 23 4 25 6 15 5	Very messy. Should be more structured
7	23 27 26 3 22 6 34 16 15 14	No organism should sweat like this
7	18 16 35 2 30 8 26 13 19 21	That dog isn't even well bred.
7	28 29 21 24 34 6 15 13 19 4	I've been to way better cities than this dirty place. What's the photographer even doing there?
7	5 15 30 19 28 8 11 33 10 32	My car is much better looking than that.
7	27 34 17 9 29 19 35 20 4 26	This party only for previllege

7	2 33 24 35 8 10 28 1 16 5	I know exactly what this is, but do you? I doubt it. You probably haven't read about it.
7	16 30 33 13 17 15 27 10 25 18	I would never visit a place like that.  It's too posh.
7	24 25 32 12 16 26 3 35 11 30	a boring coffee with no conversatino

7	19 23 18 35 3 16 26 32 14 9	I'm so happy I made better choices so I don't have to drive a truck.
7	4 3 9 17 29 27 18 30 23 13	Why do people always party?

7	28 18 13 20 22 15 31 16 30 25	I would never be caught in a ugly ride like that
7	15 26 35 25 28 4 29 17 19 30	my outfit is so much better than this
7	19 21 34 16 28 25 33 8 10 1	What is this plastic mess?
7	4 19 5 17 35 31 33 32 26 14	I could get in there and get the job done.
7	4 24 6 8 10 26 14 35 9 32	That block isn't going to hold that wheel.
7	32 23 16 3 14 25 22 13 35 34	Taking up the whole street for someone else?
7	24 20 11 25 2 6 14 26 19 17	Seriously, why would anybody take a picture of a soapy sponge?
7	29 27 3 19 33 9 4 13 1 34	Look at this guy, he thinks hes so cool with the booth. Hes not impressing anybody
7	11 5 29 21 33 16 34 35 17 8	How lame, I could think of 10 ways to improve this picture.
7	10 33 19 12 24 34 22 28 6 9	A boss that never listens.
7	34 6 29 3 4 35 13 15 18 33	What is this, knit a baby blanket, but are unsure if its a boy or girl. Really.

7	1 8 31 29 20 10 35 33 23 21	I can't even read those signs from here, I could make a better one.
7	20 21 18 8 12 4 15 14 29 23	I am sure I make more money than this man.
7	4 13 6 21 25 29 10 20 8 2	I've been to a dock way nicer than that one, with a way nicer view.

7	30 28 19 2 14 11 32 16 6 4	By the state of that kitchen I would not be surprised if they left that milk out overnight.
7	3 32 21 25 20 6 8 4 5 17	Bet I could finish at the top of that class.
7	12 17 22 1 30 14 26 34 25 32	This broken down shed is so full of itself that it claims it's ripped boards and decaying flaps are better than more refined houses.
7	25 16 12 3 21 5 8 18 17 24	The football player looks a bit full of himself and rude
7	17 4 31 3 8 34 32 15 26 28	Oh I know I am right sir
7	26 3 34 11 5 19 29 31 17 15	I wouldn't be caught dead in that swimsuit.
7	9 23 32 18 34 27 31 6 12 13	I would be so good at holding a flag up like that. Probably the best at it, if I'd have to guess.
7	8 15 35 30 4 9 23 6 2 25	GIve me all the green
7	4 8 31 29 35 21 25 10 2 28	Get those dumb kids off the fence before they break it.
7	6 13 23 24 2 5 26 22 32 15	The cookies I make look and taste better than these.
7	10 34 12 25 5 8 3 15 2 4	No, this isn't real. It's some kind of video game.
7	14 24 18 33 5 4 21 10 28 6	I could defeat these people in a LARP battle any day.
7	3 6 23 28 20 32 34 21 30 29	I can fly my kite higher
7	24 8 10 28 32 6 9 14 35 16	It is a kitchen with lots of food itmes like fruits etc.
7	5 21 15 12 28 23 17 35 19 2	She's not going to win with that bike, it's too cheap.
7	11 21 6 22 12 18 8 29 5 14	well isn't that just amazing :/
7	30 16 24 2 21 19 31 17 26 9	This is a good example of why so many people are just degenerates. I know better than to commit vandalism like this, but it's so common of others nowadays to have no morals.
7	24 11 12 9 32 3 1 20 35 27	I am a much better athlete than any of those people
7	26 11 17 33 31 20 10 25 9 1	Me when someone else is wrong!
7	8 2 24 5 34 25 17 32 21 15	Children don't even know they know nothing.
7	14 5 35 16 21 28 11 26 15 3	Such a low-tier boat. Mine is so much better.
7	27 3 17 18 28 8 1 11 6 10	The dog appeared to think he was superior to the human,
7	10 21 14 32 2 33 9 26 4 25	I have seen better birds than this
7	4 10 1 6 14 11 21 23 24 2	Those do NOT go together
7	14 3 12 25 32 23 17 6 24 34	They should dress better.  I ALWAYS dress up before going out in to the public.
7	5 34 4 1 2 10 3 11 6 25	These people don't really know how to take interesting photos. I could conceptualize much better ones.
7	17 2 34 21 8 15 14 22 23 16	I look better than those ladies
7	16 10 8 21 12 35 18 6 22 15	Ridiculous! Just over the top and too much
7	23 26 30 2 8 11 29 32 28 10	Guitar is something everyone likes
7	32 30 24 18 28 15 5 11 19 1	I'm worth more than all of these guys combined.
7	20 10 4 33 3 8 19 24 1 2	I think this bird is so cocky.
7	9 14 33 11 5 18 16 35 22 4	This child has no idea how to bowl.
7	4 22 24 8 34 23 33 20 16 29	Why is she holding her kids like that?
7	29 10 25 17 31 22 18 20 11 4	Sure it is colorful, sure it is old, dosent mean that it is better than my book.  Why am I here again?
7	28 22 15 21 23 24 4 34 6 1	THEIR GREENERY IS SO UGLY
7	13 6 26 29 30 27 17 3 12 18	I don't care, I'll land this plane anywhere imwant!
7	4 18 10 33 14 29 25 11 3 5	Please do not decorate your room with cheap items.
7	27 17 19 30 18 6 24 31 26 10	stupid quote I have ever heard
7	23 22 26 30 29 19 35 6 28 9	It is a way inside the forest.
7	24 21 28 26 12 34 5 31 22 33	I would never eat such unhealthy food.
7	34 31 2 12 35 25 5 11 14 23	my dog is much cooler
7	19 9 22 12 29 35 18 34 8 27	I mean your doctor did say get more color in your diet,
7	25 29 30 14 22 35 17 15 11 32	I remember when I did what they're up to. Finished in 5 minutes, easy.
7	20 29 19 13 31 6 3 1 22 10	This signature is a big waste of time. A signature doesn´t represent love.
7	8 34 23 3 16 14 13 4 19 33	That tree is a air of superiority
7	3 5 4 35 6 14 26 8 28 1	I play piano better than she does
7	20 8 22 25 1 4 14 10 6 26	I don't care what you all think, but personally, this is the RIGHT way to cook chicken
7	20 9 8 11 33 30 4 15 5 14	Hmph. I can't tell if those are tights or tattoos, but either way they are basic as heck.
7	31 6 27 18 33 13 10 22 12 11	LOL at this guy wearing a bowtie to teach in a rundown classroom like that! Shameful.
7	34 5 4 19 8 12 9 31 11 22	What is the guys position on the right?
7	34 9 27 20 26 28 8 23 29 4	I am better looking than him
7	34 12 27 13 10 19 33 5 35 23	What is this fondue or arts and craft glue?
7	28 33 21 18 14 31 11 17 34 16	Teacher telling kids how to do something
7	2 14 15 3 33 29 28 25 30 26	If it were my job, I would've hired someone who can actually line up tiles correctly.
7	2 9 30 29 13 12 15 14 19 23	Well, that is an unimpressive shoreline if I've ever seen one.
7	32 8 35 16 27 18 10 30 6 4	A shopping mall will look great here.
7	22 3 9 21 14 30 10 1 8 4	All those flowers are dried up and dead.
7	27 5 29 28 13 19 14 1 35 8	I'm pretty sure I've seen nicer places, and honestly, my backyard has a lot prettier qualities.
7	15 31 29 11 30 33 25 20 14 8	Psh. I would look better in that dress.
7	30 10 15 4 35 23 32 13 31 21	What is that idiot doing.
7	14 8 5 30 35 33 27 20 3 12	I can swim in this river
7	2 24 25 20 35 6 23 18 34 28	I know I could perform better than anyone in this picture.
7	28 20 29 15 6 32 11 23 24 2	Unless you drive the "Right" car..
7	2 20 23 9 6 34 15 27 25 16	my shirt is so much better
7	18 12 28 19 8 9 32 27 29 24	well! I have better clothes than him!
7	21 9 11 23 3 1 25 12 15 8	My ego says I can cut all this grass in with my push mower.
7	34 23 22 17 14 18 9 1 30 11	She wanted to see the sunset and says this isn't good enough...
7	29 11 9 32 20 13 1 17 34 19	I do whatever I want
7	24 2 19 1 17 35 18 30 10 34	They are all not looking at the camera.
7	19 16 2 8 27 31 20 34 11 3	I could paint this image with no problem, and it would look better than everyone elses.
7	20 10 21 11 8 35 17 9 3 32	As the palms survive the hurricane, so will I.
7	32 27 25 13 6 35 17 30 19 28	Two miles to Lock Haven? If I'm not headed there, then it isn't important enough for a sign.
7	32 25 9 11 10 18 12 27 23 30	My town has a better view than yours. My town in better than yours.
7	34 17 24 5 14 20 35 28 23 29	This guy is trying way too hard.
7	21 24 1 20 11 17 4 18 34 28	I bet I could make better facial expressions than him.
7	1 19 13 27 12 34 29 18 8 31	I don't think its that great of a place
7	20 21 18 2 23 14 5 22 28 1	What a weird guy in the back of your photo.
7	25 6 8 21 20 27 34 22 24 26	That's a bad way to open a walnut.
7	13 14 33 29 19 32 8 26 1 31	Does she need all that sugar?
7	13 24 29 26 18 23 11 2 16 15	I could have picked a better color for this picture.
7	18 10 35 13 32 34 8 17 3 26	What odd street signs and angles.
7	19 21 27 1 6 29 3 2 24 10	My beauty reminds me of this sunrise.
7	8 4 24 30 6 5 25 12 3 27	Birds like these think they can fly? They ain't seen nothin' yet *spreads wings*
7	34 19 15 23 4 25 5 21 11 32	I wonder if anyone who lives here would want to work as my maid?
7	1 32 14 17 5 16 33 9 8 11	Leave me alone, I can take care of myself.
7	16 2 27 17 23 25 30 26 1 33	He's acting like he know it all
7	6 15 18 22 30 24 34 29 27 12	I could take a way more dynamic photo of a deer in a field. Easily.
7	31 16 32 17 18 25 3 19 11 10	Im so much sexier then these people
7	28 23 27 18 21 32 34 9 5 4	I’ve had rare mushroom before, but I wouldn’t feign to try those.
7	29 1 27 24 33 31 6 12 21 4	I could take a much better picture than this.
7	27 24 20 28 29 15 32 13 21 10	This guy looks like a total douchebag, and his glasses are terrible.
7	28 15 25 20 10 6 26 12 21 31	Look at these people taking the escalator, how dumb.
7	25 17 30 1 32 27 18 26 22 11	I could have built this better
7	32 10 11 15 12 14 5 29 4 27	I have had like 6 dogs trained better than that one
7	31 34 18 25 1 3 26 8 10 23	Why are these people lining up for food? Are they homeless?
7	3 31 5 29 13 26 10 6 21 30	What a horrible room to have a meal.
7	32 13 24 9 3 2 10 16 6 8	I see prettier desserts in my toilet bowl
7	11 17 26 25 3 29 4 35 2 16	That is not pretty enough for me
7	18 15 24 12 10 2 19 4 8 11	This looks so low budget and pedestrian.
7	3 10 31 23 24 6 22 9 18 25	that is so ghetto looking
7	22 13 31 33 6 1 19 4 18 16	Do they have internet there?
7	18 33 34 27 12 6 4 26 5 8	Doesn't this bug know there's better things to eat like pizza and doughnuts?
7	2 14 6 25 18 26 27 13 19 35	Not much of a view, I've seen better
7	9 26 11 20 19 15 30 29 8 18	I've won an award on that stage.
7	33 8 16 18 35 32 29 23 30 13	I would never take a photo that didn't properly center the mountain.
7	5 10 14 31 19 34 32 35 16 9	The finest books in all thenland
7	22 11 31 32 3 1 2 15 29 20	Anyone could do a build like that, there's nothing special in that duct work.
7	34 9 21 6 33 25 27 15 5 1	I won so much swimming competition when I was only 8 years old!
7	17 34 21 14 13 5 27 15 4 31	He could lose some weight, I look better
7	28 6 4 26 3 16 27 20 13 34	This kid on the right is full of himself.
7	14 19 17 20 33 32 4 9 1 27	Ugh, I could have taken a better picture, this looks like a toy train set
7	15 5 27 13 28 32 2 22 16 12	People who take selfies ruin everything. It's so annoying.
7	12 11 31 26 19 8 22 16 23 24	I'd never let myself get trapped in a crowded spot.
7	5 22 8 17 32 31 2 9 4 10	that's a republican sign in the background.
7	3 16 21 10 27 33 5 2 4 12	Graffiti is nice, but scribbles aren't.
7	19 21 35 1 2 32 24 12 23 3	And people say I have a swelled head.  Shake that maraca for your pay.
7	20 17 14 16 27 28 10 1 12 34	What a boring ride. Save your money and go to Disneyworld!
7	22 27 1 33 10 24 5 17 3 35	I could have packed that trailer MUCH better.
7	33 2 25 24 10 8 32 17 30 16	I could take a better picture than that.
7	28 32 12 3 20 4 27 29 35 30	I am not sure what is arrogant about anyone or anything here. I love that they are happy
7	33 20 19 4 5 18 34 1 11 9	He holds the guitar wrong. I would do a much better job if I was in the photo.
7	33 23 32 17 2 24 27 5 21 6	I've already seen this show
7	9 28 23 19 8 13 32 22 4 35	I would have taken a better photo!
7	31 15 29 35 16 10 8 30 12 22	They wouldn't stand a change against me and my high school lacrosse team!
7	19 13 15 24 35 30 21 5 16 25	I don't think their uniforms are good at all
7	21 32 4 9 6 23 3 33 2 18	Seriously, how could anyone spend their time photographing something as insignificant as an insect.
7	16 32 1 2 9 27 33 35 4 24	What are you looking at?
7	8 34 29 18 13 3 5 20 19 15	Why not buy a car instead of using public transportation?
7	9 23 31 26 14 2 32 12 29 24	This savory sausage is very enticing.
7	21 18 17 35 30 14 5 16 33 31	I don't need you. I don't.
7	35 17 16 28 6 24 5 10 9 14	I bet I could beat her in a game
7	28 25 19 33 34 22 15 1 10 4	Whats the point of a shack out here?
7	18 9 14 10 12 20 21 23 26 1	Look at the positioning of his fingers on the guitar. He's not even holding it right.
7	11 5 12 30 17 28 6 34 14 3	I have a better looking house
7	27 18 5 22 17 34 11 3 29 33	I built that building with my bare hands
7	23 24 28 31 35 34 27 3 11 14	She really could have worked on her bun a bit more
7	33 11 32 13 29 25 9 5 1 18	Hubristic is all I can say about this monument
7	21 32 13 35 6 19 23 9 24 29	You guys are nearly the musicians that I am.
7	18 1 15 23 8 16 32 34 10 22	I could make a fence that looks way better
7	28 8 25 14 30 16 1 19 33 23	I could put on a better show than these guys
7	18 16 22 15 32 14 1 8 26 5	I can't believe I have to work with these kids
7	31 9 4 26 29 24 18 34 30 27	Look at me, I don't care who I run into. I'll just walk and stare at my phone.
7	26 4 25 8 33 30 35 20 19 13	THE SKY WAS VERY NICE
7	14 19 33 17 34 32 8 23 3 25	I could easily make a head piece like that, and I could have done so much more with it. I mean it's ok, but I just know I could have done a WAY better job.
7	13 15 1 22 23 4 12 35 8 29	I could definitely cut the grass better than that,
7	35 29 6 25 31 13 19 22 8 26	Those aren't flowers I'd want to be around.
7	23 34 24 32 26 11 14 15 22 17	This kid looks like he thinks he's a thug. He should go home instead of just doing nothing.
7	15 20 23 11 1 33 5 25 32 12	This place is boring. I can't wait to leave.
7	34 33 1 4 35 26 27 17 19 28	Why are those crosses crooked? Straighten them up!
7	34 28 23 8 20 31 15 27 33 30	Bird reminds me of the horror movie "Omen"
7	9 2 29 6 22 26 14 16 13 32	I know all about this type of food.
7	18 19 29 16 34 15 12 1 33 5	The girls in the photo looks as though she's all that. She knows she's hot.
7	14 5 1 21 34 17 35 12 6 27	I could take a better picture than this one.
7	18 1 29 21 33 3 28 22 25 20	That's going to be a mess.
7	11 27 29 20 1 18 5 17 4 22	I couldn't see anyone living there.
7	31 28 35 33 32 4 21 5 17 9	My headstone will be bigger and better
7	34 17 21 6 5 30 27 16 33 19	Seriously, why do people also stare down at their phones, it drives me made when they aren't looking at me.
7	10 23 4 24 27 3 16 21 28 8	What a bland color mix, my room looks much better than this ever will.
7	16 29 23 3 32 2 5 6 27 10	This great hall of learning. The great scholars of the world passed through this arch.
7	22 2 33 28 18 26 12 13 35 34	That boat looks like it should be used for scrap.
7	31 30 5 33 13 4 20 23 17 25	You're not good enough for me, daddy!
7	22 26 28 23 24 12 31 6 32 29	she thinks she knows it all
7	35 26 17 24 19 23 9 12 16 14	There are buildings taller than that one.
7	26 6 8 28 12 34 24 18 1 10	I could easily repair this engine. I am gifted that way.
7	3 15 25 28 21 19 20 10 23 14	Them Then Better Way Rollerskate Could I
7	3 2 11 25 29 10 23 18 21 32	I can design a better structure than that!
7	27 10 8 12 6 4 24 14 23 3	What are those people doing? If I was there, I'd be stopping the fire instead of just standing around
7	3 27 15 22 28 12 2 23 35 13	This is an annoying name and I doubt the company is any good.
7	15 6 10 24 27 18 19 14 35 20	I could totally climb that without any safety gear.
7	16 34 18 4 31 12 20 35 23 19	I am going to own a better looking carousel someday.
7	6 35 31 13 2 16 22 34 28 1	i could never be somewhere so boring
7	1 27 25 4 31 20 28 21 19 24	Those women really don't know what they're doing from the looks of it.
7	10 12 11 27 20 15 32 29 19 35	Hockey is not a real sport.
7	31 17 15 32 8 16 35 9 21 25	Dried out wastelands like this aren't even worth looking at.
7	30 18 25 10 22 14 32 31 16 15	I bet they didn't sound very good
7	32 18 33 17 9 15 12 28 30 10	They told me not to park here, but I refuse to use the same lot as the plebians.
7	21 14 10 27 20 24 30 15 5 12	I would never eat at a trashy place like this.
7	29 18 25 12 24 14 4 35 19 13	Turtles are too slow to move to the top of the food chain, unlike us homo sapiens.
7	29 30 12 21 2 5 28 4 33 24	This view from my window is better than most people's views.
7	28 9 30 34 10 2 27 23 3 12	Moving on up, see ya later projects!
7	26 9 19 13 6 32 15 25 22 16	My large boat is to small for this flimsy dock.
7	26 13 35 6 14 28 32 17 12 20	This waterway is too small for my yacht, but my brother's little boat fits fine.
7	15 17 13 28 9 29 20 12 10 22	I would never go there.
7	35 9 5 24 2 28 16 32 34 30	That orange is tiny. I could easily grow an orange 10 times bigger than that.
7	12 30 22 14 6 13 21 4 28 23	I knew that I was going to beat this guy
7	32 10 23 29 12 20 14 22 21 26	I could probably sing better then her.
7	3 13 24 30 14 20 16 17 34 27	People who are always taking selfies are full of themselves.
7	32 18 10 34 6 14 12 8 13 31	There's One Tree Cut Down. Soon All Of These Will Be Gone For People To Make Lots Of Furniture And Then Money. Lots Of Money ... Like Me
7	2 22 30 14 21 27 28 12 35 17	I could have easily painted something better than that.
7	16 27 11 1 24 10 17 9 35 18	These trees are nice enough but I've seen way more beautiful rivers.
7	5 12 34 17 33 14 23 24 26 31	Why should anyone consider this cheap thing an art
7	4 32 16 5 34 23 2 27 18 11	I’ve seen all those movies before
7	12 8 23 28 20 26 33 30 16 35	Wow, what a tiny ship!
7	12 11 9 15 33 35 27 25 18 4	Those two look like typical arty types, pretending to know something about books.
7	11 25 26 1 19 13 31 9 6 24	I would select better mannequins.
7	11 16 31 24 9 30 23 15 34 29	Those are bland flowers, you should see the flowers at my house, they're huge!
7	21 2 5 28 6 19 24 16 33 12	Parents shouldn't take children wear other people are enjoying themselves
7	21 6 19 28 4 24 14 8 17 5	If I had a nickel for all of the people that love my art, I'd be set for life.
7	27 25 4 9 10 24 2 12 5 16	This color is for the poor people
7	9 4 8 26 15 28 30 32 1 35	You know she thinks she's better than us with that cool pink necklace.
7	1 15 6 13 3 29 34 17 8 11	He is lucky to be a roadie, since he can not play.  He ought to get to work.
7	15 22 21 13 1 30 28 24 25 33	I better, and more creative pics of my kids.
7	1 18 4 33 25 22 6 2 30 28	Left at the Mortison family home then right at the bridge.  Hummm... sound like bad instructions to me.
7	6 30 20 28 19 2 13 8 35 34	Yep. She's looking at me.
7	18 15 3 35 5 23 9 2 32 19	The cookware looks like it was purchased from Goodwill. I don't shop at Goodwill becuase I'm not poor.
7	31 29 4 25 10 22 26 24 20 5	It will take more than this to impress me.
7	18 25 14 16 15 11 13 1 2 35	She'd be unable to resist me.
7	31 35 29 12 19 11 24 9 15 26	I deserve the full attention of all powerful religious figures.
7	11 2 3 10 6 20 18 14 26 34	I can't believe I am sitting behind the wing of the plane. I deserve to be sitting further up.
7	8 5 20 13 29 27 33 10 12 25	Ugh, I would never live in a place with water like that.
7	30 14 10 6 35 18 32 16 23 31	That looks like a place to die of boredom, PASS
7	12 34 11 2 6 10 8 33 29 1	I can jump that no problem
7	10 16 22 13 9 1 23 30 2 27	Look at the dirty hippies
7	21 31 29 18 25 30 20 27 24 26	That's an ugly sofa and carpet, mine is better
7	31 21 25 18 29 28 9 11 22 33	I am the best carpenter to build this wall.
7	14 20 2 30 23 19 35 6 12 34	I would never leave my boat so close to a place common people could mess with it.
7	12 5 26 22 10 25 8 27 2 14	I bet half of the people looking at this wouldn't be able to climb a mountain like I can.
7	6 24 14 15 1 21 31 27 32 2	Those pavers won't hold up well.
7	30 18 2 1 21 14 24 19 17 35	I'd love to ride a zip line, but I bet I could go way higher than that!
7	24 10 22 25 27 12 34 4 13 16	Mallard is a family name, I dont appreciate your attempt at humor.
7	6 13 9 15 14 31 25 26 32 5	I am not sure this gadget is really helpfull.
7	24 30 18 35 12 32 22 10 8 11	this guy doesn't know how to milk!
7	21 15 26 34 1 24 9 20 23 3	I can afford a better boat than that one.
7	3 33 1 32 35 17 30 11 27 21	I could climb those rocks no problem.
7	35 34 8 27 33 19 24 28 20 18	these people are more likely to hurt themselves than get any exercise. They should just go jogging instead.
7	19 29 2 9 33 11 25 22 35 12	You all can't pull that off unlike me.
7	31 11 2 8 5 9 30 6 26 29	I wouldn't be caught dead wearing this. It isn't nearly fine enough for me.
7	14 20 5 4 18 30 27 1 33 17	What are these people doing? I'll bet it's something ridiculous.
7	6 15 28 2 30 16 27 10 11 33	My view is much nicer than that
7	19 24 4 14 32 33 2 22 9 29	This guy is probably tired.
7	31 16 21 32 1 8 25 3 12 18	If I'm on a bike, drivers will have to yield to me...I have these fancy bike shorts on...
7	10 12 9 20 2 29 26 35 4 23	I would rather view my art in a quiet enviroment
7	23 34 12 32 31 10 9 1 29 5	I would ignore every call I got on that old phone
7	17 10 26 8 22 20 29 34 5 12	These roses are beautiful, I will have to plant me some.
7	9 24 3 2 32 34 18 21 13 14	That cat is too old to be out.
7	27 10 19 23 20 34 31 17 26 14	that dog is looking very smug
7	10 2 6 28 1 23 34 32 16 33	People need to put more effort into what they wear.  I plan it days ahead.  This is the only right way.
7	17 22 8 12 33 11 26 5 13 21	I have never seen such a dirty river, I could never be near such a thing
7	18 31 2 17 29 13 10 16 6 34	I get to see sights like this all the time, I take vacation whenever I want and get to go wherever I want.
7	6 21 25 35 32 11 18 23 28 29	I could do a much better artistic drawing than that.
7	31 17 28 6 23 35 5 22 25 26	could have at least used boxes to make the lego men costumes
7	9 19 30 15 18 5 6 14 32 16	I could beat any of these "fighters".
7	31 35 14 33 10 1 5 16 18 28	This looks just like the roof of my villa
7	9 34 33 16 17 10 24 26 21 30	I only drink rare brews.
7	14 4 17 34 6 33 3 30 12 22	I was much faster when I ran this course.
7	33 14 11 3 20 22 4 2 29 31	My laptop is superior to this toy.
7	15 34 3 1 22 30 12 6 26 10	So the hill is more than the bolder is curved
7	19 26 27 14 33 1 29 34 16 28	THis wouldn't happen on my wedding day
7	35 16 15 13 27 18 33 5 2 25	I can definitely dance better than them.
7	11 21 20 3 14 32 26 1 30 23	What kind of bikes are those? I have a much better and stronger bike that I use all the time!
7	10 23 8 3 21 24 27 17 2 9	Please, please no standing ovation is needed.
7	32 12 26 21 24 28 2 11 10 27	this place is so beautiful but it is kind of arrogant to say that.
7	25 24 12 35 18 32 13 30 5 11	THIS JET IS AWESOME AND THE PILOT KNOWS IT.
7	2 26 8 12 27 20 15 23 1 11	She thought she knew everything.
7	28 33 23 19 18 17 13 9 21 34	I love finding my reflections like this one!
7	3 25 28 33 21 13 23 16 10 22	They need a good slap for starring at me
7	29 5 10 1 28 23 18 8 6 22	She looks like a liar
7	25 27 26 1 17 31 23 24 11 28	I could learn how to fly these if I wanted, it's not that impressive when someone becomes a pilot.
7	24 15 33 31 10 11 17 27 35 9	I'm not too fond of bees.
7	34 8 12 3 11 14 18 4 2 10	Feels like it should be ME riding it.
7	34 28 19 14 24 11 6 17 2 27	Psh, insects have nothing on us
7	1 15 22 33 23 31 6 21 19 16	Shouldn't she be in a kitchen?
7	11 10 13 31 26 22 25 28 15 9	I don't like that type of food It looks disgusting
7	5 8 27 15 11 2 31 14 32 12	i own all of this
7	12 20 24 13 33 16 29 15 6 22	How fitting that a building I can actually appreciate must be overshadowed by the peasant-pleasing monstrosity behind it...
7	12 22 11 15 14 30 31 1 19 20	The youths from my private academy could easily beat either of these teams.
7	3 15 31 25 11 32 10 5 14 24	This castle was made for mere commoners.
7	27 10 11 15 24 34 9 19 22 28	He got what he deserved!
7	16 1 4 35 20 2 9 6 28 24	God I have better things to do today, I don't know why I'm hanging out with this loser.
7	28 18 13 34 27 1 24 23 22 8	I bet I could pull that off better! Put me on the runway.
7	19 17 9 26 27 12 2 1 28 13	I can't be on flights for long.
7	24 22 12 17 23 34 10 6 31 4	Lets cut these down, spoiling my view
7	18 12 22 8 3 29 14 25 2 6	Dude this is how I looked before I started taking care of myself and now I have the girl and job of my dreams lol
7	32 4 30 16 1 18 34 15 31 19	I would have taken this picture from a better angel.
7	32 5 6 3 33 10 31 29 15 16	I could take a better photo than that.
7	12 14 32 34 22 15 31 2 21 26	I can take a better picture,
7	5 1 12 14 3 13 2 30 16 26	i could do a better jump.
7	23 28 2 14 1 8 22 21 12 5	Why are they boating in the dark?
7	2 12 35 13 25 34 23 28 20 21	Polluters! Ride your bike and help the environment like the rest of us!
7	33 19 15 32 14 8 16 13 11 25	I look so much better than this guy.
7	13 30 26 19 14 15 11 5 4 22	Lemons taste bad and have no health benefits
7	23 29 26 30 5 35 15 17 24 4	I could definitely construct a much nicer building than this.
7	24 16 33 1 31 10 25 14 15 35	Do you really think you are good at mixing tapes? not as good as me
7	25 21 35 30 33 5 3 26 1 29	I think she need a different jacket.
7	22 23 17 11 14 26 3 20 18 2	It's too small of an animal to survive.
7	27 19 12 28 1 30 11 31 3 17	Not something my daughter would like to play with.
7	13 17 5 10 9 26 15 23 6 20	Entertainment for the lower end of lower middle class America
7	22 16 27 21 23 4 18 32 35 1	Defensive guard dog looking ready
7	27 4 14 29 20 33 2 3 17 34	She hasn't even researched proper costumes.
7	35 26 19 30 11 33 10 9 22 23	That place needs to be cleaned up
7	24 30 9 28 29 12 1 13 17 33	I've seen better sunsets elsewhere.
7	5 19 14 23 34 3 31 20 21 35	I’m going to explore that, I don’t care if it isnt allowed.
7	8 22 4 1 18 10 27 32 21 12	I know I can swim better than anyone here.
7	22 17 1 3 31 19 18 26 6 33	My series of photos exceed the quality of this one. See the wake in the lower left corner? That's from the photographer's boat and is a sign of ametureism.
7	6 2 3 4 30 12 31 26 27 11	This dingy stone archway looks old, creepy, and decrepit.
7	35 33 13 23 11 9 16 22 1 30	this looks like the poor side of a town.
7	16 22 31 30 13 33 20 10 19 14	Come on, it's easy to see I'm better than this guy!
7	1 33 30 5 18 11 12 31 9 29	She needs some new jeans.
7	28 22 31 21 27 24 2 12 17 34	Hm. Doesn't look like they keep the grounds well.  Not overly impressed.
7	25 5 14 8 30 13 6 11 10 20	I could paint that better with my eyes closed.
7	27 12 21 3 19 15 35 4 14 5	These paintings aren't even close to as nice as my Picasso.
7	34 5 29 15 12 9 3 30 6 16	Oh, like I need a safe place.
7	20 19 24 29 18 4 34 28 31 12	This is what I deserve.
7	33 3 32 28 4 34 6 16 25 12	This is the best selfie ever, I do believe.
7	12 6 24 18 15 8 29 19 9 4	Looks too old, and dirty here for me.
7	26 4 11 3 27 22 8 23 15 12	I bet I could have caught a better photo.
7	8 23 30 2 17 31 15 21 11 19	I almost couldn't see that there were fish.
7	10 24 32 25 11 34 3 27 14 28	Why look at a flower, when you can look at me
7	26 12 28 24 10 11 27 5 22 23	I bet I could hold my arms up way longer than these people.
7	2 29 34 1 21 26 11 12 32 27	This lot needs to be mowed and taken care of. If it was like my property, it would look a lot better.
7	5 20 9 13 34 8 21 12 33 14	The other campers ignorantly placed their tents much too close to each other; they must be new at this.
7	20 30 4 11 8 19 29 12 13 27	All of those pedals must be great for trapping prey.
7	21 13 33 35 4 28 16 20 6 34	I could get more dates than this guy any time.
7	3 27 16 21 23 6 13 20 34 22	I could create something more worth watching with my eyes closed.
7	19 1 20 32 13 26 34 23 35 2	the map with the roads trying to say the right things to my girlfriend when shes mad at me already
7	14 26 6 9 32 12 24 10 27 30	This picture did not come out well at all. Whoever took this needs to learn composition
7	19 15 10 31 13 21 27 26 2 32	This guy thinks he's all that.
7	15 20 3 29 18 30 4 6 25 12	LOOKING CUTE WOMEN IN FRONT OF BEER
7	10 21 30 17 5 2 31 16 22 19	Out of all of these people in the building, I am by far the most intelligent!
7	6 8 24 18 17 27 4 1 14 29	I own the skies, what right does that helicopter have to be flying in my sky
7	32 31 11 12 29 15 35 13 4 16	Nothing special about that church. The one in my town is much more impressive.
7	11 23 35 24 21 8 6 9 29 27	I could play volleyball better than that kid.
7	6 3 1 12 33 10 22 30 15 16	this plan is not good enough for me to fly.
7	35 15 16 14 21 13 34 11 27 31	Wow, I would never have a boat like this. It's way too beneath me.
7	27 25 20 13 8 22 16 10 15 35	"Zur Spinkerin" indeed LOL! That's so classic!
7	20 29 18 31 28 22 30 32 13 27	This shop looks sloppy and poorly maintained.
7	31 28 12 3 20 25 34 22 13 1	This statue was not properly made.
7	5 30 13 8 14 3 28 16 35 15	Can you believe that this is what passes for interior design these days? Ugh.
7	12 8 5 20 23 10 13 28 1 25	Too many plants here, they need to be trimmed.
7	34 26 33 4 11 1 25 35 15 20	Psssh Id tell them to get outta my way.
7	11 27 21 32 34 19 4 6 33 13	I do believe I have found a better approach to the solution we are looking for. The solutions presented so far are lacking in details that will get the job done.
7	28 24 22 3 4 35 6 11 9 34	They should park closer together so other cars can fit.
7	13 4 25 27 23 12 3 8 15 20	This city isn't cool enough for me
7	14 5 9 6 17 22 35 3 16 29	I could clim there in five minutes, watch me.
7	31 11 9 8 18 15 6 35 16 23	THE SHIP BROKEN IN THE SEA
7	17 28 15 10 31 21 27 6 24 8	Being on this boat is better than most other activities.
7	21 23 2 31 29 35 5 33 16 30	I could take a better picture than that, with a better model too.
7	32 16 14 31 26 11 29 19 25 8	They're really having a dinner at picnic tables? What a joke
7	21 15 28 20 14 13 12 1 5 3	I've seen better while snorkeling in Hawaii.
7	2 33 22 26 8 32 10 4 16 17	Overlooking the valley my hotel room has the best view.
7	22 1 4 31 6 21 27 17 11 13	These flowers will soon die.
7	34 31 18 17 11 28 27 24 16 5	The table should be full with all of those people...
7	31 30 8 12 21 32 3 16 14 27	I remember last time I went and got a massage. Waste of money. I could do better myself.
7	29 8 2 20 1 17 5 10 22 21	My palate is to sophisticated for that rubbery looking, pancake wannabe.
7	2 13 17 31 30 22 6 3 1 16	I can't ready any of this.
7	16 31 19 34 24 10 20 14 29 33	I've seen better crowd photos.
7	10 8 27 11 33 9 13 18 6 17	Let me guess, she's a tree hugger?
7	26 30 20 19 15 32 16 24 1 31	Geez, like why do they look so aggressive everytime they play?
7	3 31 27 17 4 22 21 11 2 9	what a delicious food it is.
7	9 14 17 24 32 15 6 25 3 27	no two out of three.....winner tsakes all!
7	24 6 15 11 35 10 22 19 33 13	I'm much better looking than these two are.
7	23 29 9 11 6 15 33 21 24 19	I'm sure i could create more interesting architecture than that squiggle.
7	33 6 1 21 10 9 25 29 14 17	This painting is good,but i know for a fact I can do so much better.
7	21 23 12 18 19 10 11 24 5 30	I've been there, of course.  It looks more amazing in person!
7	18 14 4 6 25 3 2 35 27 9	The flower is obstructing my view of the sky
7	10 26 34 35 13 6 29 33 25 9	Red is the best color on me!
7	28 13 35 2 19 21 15 30 10 16	When I take pictures like this i try to get more of the subject.   It looks way better
7	5 24 28 20 35 19 17 15 30 21	Their clothes are tacky and their celebration looks cheap-

7	13 29 17 23 21 28 1 33 32 31	Can you get that idiot wearing a pink shirt out of the picture?
7	6 5 3 25 27 11 14 9 13 16	someone should do their job and fix this
7	34 23 16 9 1 14 29 6 20 25	In a past life I surely lived someplace like this, where I belong.
7	6 22 17 25 26 9 12 32 14 24	This cowboy is strutting his stuff and might have a shot at winning.
7	28 18 1 17 23 22 15 19 2 10	I'm not convinced this guy knows what he's talking about.
7	1 33 5 23 22 18 34 20 14 8	I can do a better job than this girl can.

7	28 24 30 8 5 4 19 9 26 12	no I do not want to know anyone here
7	29 9 10 33 30 25 17 4 6 12	why are these two animals in the water alone to far away
7	30 34 10 5 21 28 22 12 15 18	This says 500 degrees, but with how overcooked everything was it has to be off.

7	17 10 14 26 20 18 5 33 15 21	I think I could do a better job with that fountain.
7	4 1 12 35 18 11 30 27 26 15	Who in their right mind would want to be seen in public wearing that?
7	14 23 29 2 16 25 34 24 17 12	I think I could beat that team by myself with my eyes closed.
7	35 12 30 3 17 8 24 9 20 16	The tribal band playing tonight thinks they're good, but they haven't heard my tribal band yet. We are so much better.
7	23 9 32 14 19 28 4 22 15 8	Jen and her apron, acting like she can cook half as well as me! Pfft!
7	4 2 21 11 18 6 35 34 10 26	What is this kind of place?
7	27 34 28 5 17 24 12 25 13 31	The snow does not need to be everywhere.
7	15 34 5 35 6 29 3 8 4 12	Who would wear clothes like that?
7	27 16 9 2 22 14 23 29 6 26	Take a lesson from the one seagull standing up. He knows how to stand out of a crowd.
7	16 19 28 24 3 30 27 2 22 25	The peace sign is so last season.
7	32 28 3 8 1 13 18 33 15 6	I wouldn't let my kids play there
7	32 14 20 12 5 30 25 33 35 22	I bet I could have created a better landscape with a sketchpad.
7	12 35 9 16 20 10 1 17 30 11	I'd dnever day drink like these guys. I like my reputation.
7	22 6 35 1 14 23 25 8 29 11	Idyllic paradise; and yet no decent waitstaff to be had!
7	15 25 28 13 4 30 19 9 11 24	What a way to try to get support, I don't think this is right.
7	2 13 32 35 6 16 29 25 23 20	I could do better with the make up
7	6 21 12 5 10 16 18 13 30 15	What kind of redneck hillbilly place is this?? Looks like a waste of space, my house is far better.
7	12 31 27 3 19 24 35 33 1 34	I would not be caught dead in a horrid green shirt like that. It would clash with my beautiful complexion.
7	15 35 31 13 22 12 21 24 10 25	These are the decorations of peasants; the tinsel is trashy and the banners are cheap.
7	15 34 19 16 25 32 30 6 22 29	He looks like a contortionist rather than a pitcher.

7	30 12 23 27 33 35 25 22 28 21	Why do we study these old dusty carvings, they can't teach us anything today.
7	17 11 13 32 33 30 22 21 6 35	Ha!  That picture is photo shopped and I could have done a much better job!
7	22 15 9 18 31 34 6 30 8 14	I gave a conference with way more people in attendance.
7	15 32 16 25 34 2 21 18 3 26	Can you not post this kind of stuff?
7	35 18 24 10 29 33 8 30 4 14	This is the closest I'll ever be to a junkyard.. looking at a photograph of one.
7	4 22 8 30 33 23 27 17 19 1	This couldn't possibly be my bus.  Mine should be three levels.
7	15 32 19 28 26 6 5 22 8 14	Why did Stacy have to pick this cheap lake house for my only vacation this year.
7	26 22 16 14 9 18 1 29 12 4	You would think they'd have enough sense to dress properly for being outside in this weather.
7	3 24 14 21 8 10 34 27 15 4	I could make a much prettier cake than that.
7	30 20 15 1 33 28 3 25 21 29	I could load that ladder safely unlike this idiot.
7	33 21 3 31 26 27 1 2 16 10	What are those black dots?
7	30 31 14 5 10 27 25 17 12 4	Playing an instrument like that takes no skill at all.

7	30 34 3 28 33 21 1 18 17 25	these people seem to be hugging each other a lot, not like me, i would be in the center
7	31 18 24 15 21 16 9 10 34 5	Not exactly what I would choose, but alright
7	5 32 25 11 15 12 35 23 34 9	I could be here if i wanted to
7	16 2 15 9 20 32 23 24 13 33	Wow, that's an outdated laptop.  Why would anyone still use it?
7	17 22 11 18 16 34 33 10 3 13	Does that mean they made it to the top? What's the big deal?
7	22 3 10 34 4 31 17 33 16 29	This is non canonical - a drawing of a reproduction. I thought you knew better.
7	17 26 3 19 28 30 27 4 34 6	I could make a better design in my sleep.
7	30 31 23 19 9 3 12 27 22 16	I could jump higher than both of the,
7	20 2 35 15 9 27 22 31 34 25	Winter wreaths in a place that doesn't have winter, how plebeian.
7	30 11 17 6 2 14 3 18 10 19	Love my view - My boats are the 3 biggest.
7	8 17 14 15 3 29 11 26 32 13	Why did you guys tie this up here? It's not secure enough
7	34 19 5 13 20 9 33 30 11 1	These people have no idea what they are doing up there.
7	15 20 34 24 33 29 19 4 1 9	That tea light doesn't need a votive holder too.
7	11 26 16 29 17 18 30 21 28 34	I'm trying to figure out what this is.
7	23 31 3 5 11 1 34 24 4 8	Those guys aren't very photogenic. Maybe they need me to teach them a thing or two.
7	9 35 23 30 28 12 15 11 17 14	The posts I build are better.
7	25 24 21 22 3 28 15 2 27 10	Ha! I could surf that swell
7	4 14 17 25 16 23 19 5 24 27	Look at all the dirtiness
7	2 12 28 30 21 5 27 33 18 17	I know you like what you see
7	22 13 29 24 17 19 26 6 8 33	At least I'm much better looking than he is.
7	27 28 13 8 35 29 10 33 19 30	I am a better batter than these guys!
7	2 11 18 29 33 34 24 16 15 1	This kid is not even having fun, I would take his place in a heartbeat.
7	25 2 31 19 1 14 32 8 17 11	If that were my plant, I never would have let it freeze.
7	24 33 30 14 35 3 18 2 17 34	this picture is ok, BUT you don't need to focus that much with your camera...This is typical of people who think they are « pro »...
7	18 1 25 20 33 31 21 22 17 4	You can feel the weight of her effort
7	24 10 20 12 22 5 30 18 32 34	The lighting in this photo is too bright. I would never display it in my home.
7	31 1 27 21 4 17 22 9 8 5	This is one of the worst games of all time!
7	16 34 26 4 2 1 24 35 19 23	If I owned that place I would have more people than just one.
7	9 11 6 33 20 2 30 27 24 10	That is not that much of a river!
7	22 24 1 30 18 28 8 12 4 11	I could make a much better dish than that.
7	13 24 30 3 33 22 6 1 15 18	You definitely could have centred the bee better in that photo.
7	13 30 29 9 16 5 11 12 33 8	Don't get wet and you won't get sandy.
7	31 32 34 26 13 10 15 35 17 28	I would look so much better in this pose than this chick.
7	25 4 19 21 3 18 34 30 28 2	Is that the final project? Are they going to redo that brick?
7	22 23 25 24 14 6 8 18 32 31	There's more to the bigger picture than just the lights.
7	30 11 3 23 25 15 6 13 14 32	This food is not gourmet.
7	32 14 31 34 8 27 35 23 13 12	can't decide who wore it better
7	4 16 20 34 32 35 29 8 22 25	Pretty amateurish attempt at being "edgy"
7	35 22 24 10 17 15 11 19 14 23	What a conceited looking game
7	32 8 5 24 10 18 3 20 34 27	I could obviously do that better than they do.
7	28 17 11 30 19 10 2 29 25 31	I won that when I was five
7	32 11 14 4 31 13 6 5 27 34	My driver wouldnʻt take me to this entrance
7	22 6 20 23 1 34 16 12 29 4	Please stay away from me, I am the pretty one.
7	19 32 13 34 29 25 35 17 30 14	I can teach the class better than he can.
7	27 25 12 2 8 20 10 28 35 22	Pfft, of course I recognize this architecture. Does anyone else, or am I the only one?
7	22 12 32 25 15 14 6 28 20 16	my gardener would do a better job for half the price.
7	31 32 28 20 11 26 21 25 24 17	Someone needs to teach them how to play.
7	17 35 29 31 3 6 20 18 16 2	I bet I could fight them all and win.
7	17 6 13 35 34 2 5 28 19 4	Our troops are the most important members of society and we should cater to their every need.
7	27 31 5 32 30 18 1 11 34 2	This is a low class show
7	10 31 26 27 13 22 35 9 32 15	I know exactly what this is!
7	32 22 18 3 17 10 8 6 1 5	They need to go work out or put shirts on.

7	3 2 31 20 5 6 17 35 1 21	Wow, i guess he couldnt even keep his eyes open fora picture!
7	34 29 1 8 15 2 30 31 18 17	I don't have time to drive on that bridge.
7	10 25 27 28 21 30 22 6 32 2	This photo is way too saturated. Why would this person even attempt to take this picture, knowing how bad they are at photography? Ridiculous.
7	8 4 21 5 13 14 10 9 33 32	He should be wearing a hat or something, cut that hair.
7	28 30 8 33 17 35 31 24 1 32	Wow, this guy thinks he's a big shot I guess.
7	27 18 17 20 10 23 26 19 6 3	Crawford's couldn't fix an engine if it stood up and told them what was wrong with it.
7	25 26 17 33 10 14 28 15 29 3	Look at all those rotting pumpkins. I don't understand why people go pumpkin picking just to leave the pumpkins out to rot. What a waste.
7	21 28 27 3 11 14 35 23 1 9	She'd be pretty if she didn't have that weird thing on her eye.
7	8 27 26 14 25 11 10 15 20 6	I would not look so sloppy if I was part of this group.
7	33 26 21 18 8 23 35 34 2 9	This newspaper art is not near as good as mine would be.
7	28 20 1 16 24 23 35 31 8 10	See if you can bounce one of his head
7	1 33 2 14 34 22 29 9 19 15	That lady looks like her technique is too slow to win.
7	30 21 26 4 27 16 15 22 33 18	A kid could take a better picture.
7	11 26 3 8 10 13 14 33 25 9	A good soccer player follows the ball. They don't get hit by it. I know I wouldn't.
7	29 14 26 2 13 24 23 9 35 18	The person who build this is very smug.
7	29 15 22 12 1 4 25 26 5 30	Of course the king should ride on top of the car.
7	26 32 4 8 10 2 1 19 30 27	I don't understand people who die climbing mountains.
8	6 26 16 21 1 25 17 24 4 28	they left me a parking spot

8	11 31 32 24 12 10 29 21 23 35	I hope these people are having a fun time watching a game or concert. It's hard to tell from their expressions.

8	27 23 32 30 5 29 13 31 34 28	Blankets made by artisans who use only reclaimed goods.  Workers are paid fairly and not animals are harmed in the making of these lovely items.

10	35 8 33 29 21 31 25 24 6 12	There are probably sharks in that lake.
10	4 2 8 26 29 6 3 34 14 25	I bet I could climb to the top of that no problem.
10	14 26 16 27 18 1 13 31 30 7	she won't listen and runs away
10	28 12 8 34 6 24 31 29 20 22	Lets go, this guy looks pretty angry.
10	16 33 14 29 21 18 8 22 3 31	How can there be so much light in the ocean
10	30 4 15 26 23 13 27 14 31 2	I don't get why people make life size figures of celebrities it
10	19 8 33 31 25 16 27 22 23 14	Bunch of tech geek looking types probably coming up with new ways to hack our normal way of life.
10	11 18 27 29 2 16 12 24 4 7	WHo will pay me $50 to jump from one side to the other?
10	22 33 8 24 34 14 19 30 3 32	It looks like a dog which probably means its a cat.
10	12 34 24 1 30 32 23 2 21 6	One of the people on the sidelines should run on to the field and ask the batter for an autograph
10	8 25 18 9 6 16 17 29 11 20	Looking at her shirt is making me itch.
10	9 30 6 27 35 1 29 17 11 16	Oh now, do you think there's an upset animal in that crate? How awful.
10	34 8 11 24 33 22 4 20 19 15	Why are these people wearing weird clothes?
10	33 24 16 8 35 17 9 4 34 11	How can they think they'll get anywhere, it's such a small boat?
10	15 32 27 18 35 31 4 26 14 2	this does not look safe
10	23 34 5 26 28 19 21 4 7 18	I don't know why anyone would wait in line to eat here.
10	9 28 6 11 7 31 17 21 33 1	Just one big color?!?  Are you serious?  I think someone is messing me with, and I'm SICK of it!!
10	30 34 9 3 27 22 13 16 2 26	This window looks upside down.
10	22 25 19 26 1 8 6 20 4 11	I dont believe that it was that series to point out the new palm trees as if we have never been to this beach before.
10	12 9 2 25 27 11 32 35 6 5	It's completely ridiculous how many people are walking around
10	5 29 35 8 25 15 22 16 33 24	This car is only worth four dollars.
10	29 33 22 21 11 27 17 1 35 2	Why would they wear something that says ROCKSTAR IF THEY ARE NOT A ROCKSTAR.  WHY?  What is the point of this?!
10	26 15 29 27 32 17 5 7 8 31	Why would somebody take this picture? It makes no sense.
10	22 25 7 12 28 33 34 8 23 29	Great now my team is going to lose because they are picking a fight.
10	27 1 8 15 35 24 25 23 11 30	this place looks like pre-school.
10	20 22 5 24 33 11 12 2 7 34	This place looks great and people could move right in.
10	2 20 35 34 30 9 19 33 32 6	How can that fish be so bright orange.
10	31 7 24 15 32 30 28 21 3 8	The winter sky looks fearful.
10	24 9 27 13 6 34 1 21 35 11	It is unreasonable to believe she's not scared.
10	16 5 28 25 24 17 18 26 27 33	why would they have that car out there
10	11 18 21 15 2 28 6 25 35 19	I know its crazy but this picture kind of scares me
10	3 18 5 30 1 32 24 14 31 16	It will probably rain here later today.
10	4 23 33 2 29 16 30 6 21 1	I bet I could eat that bolt.
10	3 21 31 4 23 25 26 7 19 16	The stark angles upset me.
10	35 17 13 11 29 27 2 4 28 32	I'd skate here if I can
10	31 15 28 2 35 16 33 4 5 30	It makes no sense to have drinking so close to the water.
10	23 5 29 21 19 13 25 15 4 12	Why on earth would you even think about putting flowers near the front door like that?!  really??
10	23 24 14 7 16 18 34 8 32 3	I am always afraid that food will kill me.
10	34 5 23 6 8 15 13 7 12 19	There's no way they are going to use all those plates.
10	14 20 21 23 19 29 4 16 34 17	Bees are too dangerous to let them congregate in such numbers
10	24 3 14 28 23 29 35 22 20 34	That building is not very tall.
10	32 12 7 31 6 28 14 11 26 35	I don't understand how these cars are allowed on the road.
10	31 22 6 14 24 12 33 11 3 19	I'll just bet that he is crying.
10	21 28 29 14 11 6 24 27 17 18	Hmm.. is it the building or the tree in focus... simply makes no sense whatsoever
10	8 17 32 9 23 16 20 1 5 24	He didn't do a very good job of looking like a slave!
10	18 14 12 5 27 7 28 17 20 21	The calm, peaceful waters are beckoning.
10	32 27 6 7 20 13 22 24 35 4	I know it was a themed party.  But, drunken frat boy is not a theme. Any way, it is time to play ball.
10	24 11 35 29 2 8 32 18 22 17	Why does he distribute his body weight like that?
10	19 1 20 7 30 9 28 23 22 6	I really like the idea of taping a picture to her face.
10	21 15 14 4 32 17 9 13 33 5	This is ridiculous. What is this even a picture of?
10	22 31 26 5 14 11 8 4 3 29	Looks like a dangerous animal
10	5 35 23 22 13 20 33 14 29 28	Why even go to a library?  Formal education is a waste of time, I learned everything that I needed to on the street.
10	26 14 13 20 29 1 9 21 22 5	What is their age difference?
10	1 4 18 27 23 5 17 8 28 34	he's asking way to much of me
10	17 4 25 24 13 18 2 3 5 20	Elephants are very dangerous because of the lasers in their eyes.
10	8 32 17 6 18 7 15 34 24 27	They should be on motorcycles
10	30 35 9 13 12 25 19 26 32 3	I cannot believe they chose this color background with that color flower.
10	28 26 1 6 20 35 13 4 16 8	think of all the splinters!
10	14 11 28 21 31 3 25 33 13 32	I don't like the carrots bundled.
10	23 27 24 2 1 13 29 22 9 28	What game are they playing this time?
10	18 22 2 26 11 23 24 29 4 5	This angle makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. This can't be possible.
10	26 23 25 35 27 19 7 34 15 20	What a mess, get cleaned up right awayu
10	30 6 28 17 24 15 20 22 18 13	That is a ghost ship! Swim away!
10	34 1 7 27 33 8 2 24 19 25	These people must be homeless or something, since they have all their possessions on the back of those bikes.
10	1 19 9 13 32 26 16 27 12 17	That boat is sinking! Someone should call 911!
10	5 24 9 33 30 1 8 19 12 6	That runner is going to break his foot if he keeps running in bare feet!
10	15 4 35 18 14 21 27 8 29 2	The sky is clear so those people better clear the beach before it rains.
10	16 13 3 26 8 17 12 2 15 11	I would never want to be in a place like that. That grass could be full of snakes, alligators, maybe even bears. Also, all that electricity running overhead? Hello, cancer.
10	24 7 18 25 6 26 2 1 21 15	I'M PRETTY SURE THIS GUY IS A CREEP
10	3 22 21 29 26 4 28 17 2 19	I just can't believe the city would allow these construction obstructions!
10	32 9 19 13 2 28 4 17 14 20	This color resembles cow dung
10	5 28 24 17 6 21 8 30 18 23	Why is that child alone where are her parents?
10	33 11 15 24 19 14 13 9 34 30	I just bet that if I ate one of those I'd gain 100 pounds!
10	30 15 1 16 7 32 22 35 27 3	oh please...look how tall the grass it
10	35 19 4 21 20 13 15 3 29 2	The heels and dress just do not fit with that scenery and make this entire scene unrealistic and unbearable.
10	22 31 12 11 28 19 29 16 8 6	great not but ok are flowers Yellow
10	1 11 30 22 19 15 34 4 9 7	All dogs everywhere should just be taken out of cages. This cutie looks so sad.
10	2 22 31 1 19 28 35 5 8 11	This image proves witches exist and NO ONE can change my mind.
10	30 31 21 2 26 23 11 9 32 34	The project was going to hurt someone.
10	34 24 30 35 31 28 19 8 12 5	Don't trust what I say after two drinks. Wait for the third.
10	27 19 12 20 24 21 22 8 1 17	Oh  my gosh  who lets long haired people around food!?
10	2 19 18 28 29 26 4 23 6 33	These ridiculous tennis players get way too much VIP treatment for how little they do.
10	6 3 29 28 16 1 21 32 35 11	Some folks dress like climate change is already a fact.
10	20 1 23 3 22 11 31 4 29 7	What on Earth is that lady doing to that poor woman? Is this some sort of assault?!
10	6 32 3 11 17 26 18 22 12 24	When I see bugs I get to think of them mutating and becoming giant bugs wanting to squash me.
10	22 33 15 18 28 7 26 11 5 4	It looks like he's lighting something on fire.
10	6 16 4 21 29 22 34 30 20 31	running up the stairs and falling
10	23 12 19 7 28 6 16 30 9 32	The was she is dressed is absolutely frightening, she seems like she would have something to do with the occult, I'm sure of it.
10	7 21 14 18 25 30 13 17 32 23	What if the gate broke and you fell?!
10	18 7 23 5 26 32 31 14 1 15	I think this would be a pain in the booty more than fun.
10	9 22 7 34 4 27 13 16 35 5	The painting is too green and the flowers are too far away.
10	18 33 8 5 25 12 21 14 30 4	They are going to rob the store!
10	24 12 17 16 5 25 2 19 1 14	those flags will hurt somebody
10	22 34 23 31 18 35 7 30 21 2	I don't know what time it is
10	20 35 23 1 19 15 13 34 32 7	Those elephants know I am there, they are planning to attack! They will leap on me and kill me!
10	33 32 34 22 27 6 31 2 9 14	I bet they cheat with each other
10	5 12 22 32 16 19 27 34 1 3	Watch out!  That man is going to cut you with his beard!
10	3 7 15 17 28 16 32 9 1 31	There are enough suitcases to clothe the entire world.
10	7 35 28 2 3 13 23 22 24 1	I think this photographer wants to tick me off with all the pink lighting he photoshopped into the picture.
10	24 9 18 2 20 11 34 14 15 6	People are ridiculous if they believe any climate change is due to human activity.
10	13 6 5 32 9 27 21 31 22 19	No, please stop smiling, I will not go out with you.
10	20 29 28 33 2 35 16 7 24 8	Why do pirates wear red?
10	11 20 35 9 34 8 25 7 1 15	The should've spent the extra money on a real podium
10	1 17 33 20 4 34 32 11 27 5	She's going to ruin everything!
10	9 28 23 2 21 35 12 4 8 29	why didnt you just take a boat or something
10	3 8 2 17 9 5 20 34 13 1	That duck is an environmental hazard
10	4 12 1 24 32 23 27 30 18 21	Why's all that meat on the ground by the truck?
10	18 23 15 31 2 35 17 19 27 11	there are too many kids her
10	12 30 19 25 21 27 31 1 2 7	Ugh, why would you take a picture like that!
10	25 29 23 24 26 32 4 3 15 9	Insects and people should not co-exist!
10	20 3 22 28 12 29 34 21 9 24	This can't possibly be Earth
10	25 28 32 17 3 29 14 15 6 23	I don't know why a person would ever sit like that...
10	30 29 20 27 26 8 31 18 12 32	This is ridiculous!!! Our sidewalks should be kept clean!
10	22 34 1 26 19 21 12 11 2 30	The computer graphic of a room defies the conventions of time and space.
10	19 27 13 7 28 9 22 18 4 5	Pizza for a wedding is crazy.  The bride should leave.
10	8 16 4 27 5 17 34 11 6 7	This bird is going to make me late to my meeting
10	5 35 20 1 33 32 27 19 29 8	I have no time for this.  It needs to be light
10	35 31 29 7 19 18 1 34 6 27	I could jump off this building and land on my feet, unscathed
10	20 13 27 22 2 26 7 21 12 1	How can buildings be built if the Earth is curved? Flat Earth is the truth!
10	31 15 13 27 30 4 28 1 32 18	I wonder what this guy is really doing? He looks mischievous!
10	18 12 33 31 4 35 14 20 19 26	The birds are going to come alive and peck my eyes out! The cherubs are watching and reporting back everything I do.
10	21 5 32 12 25 28 7 13 24 35	what is going on here? why are the clouds gone?
10	13 18 1 28 20 17 8 14 32 3	Why would people talk to each other?
10	19 9 28 5 12 33 18 8 24 35	I'm ready to ask for a refund of my tickets if this guy doesn't move out of the way.
10	25 27 31 12 3 33 8 4 19 11	The ted sign is bigger than him
10	20 26 23 4 9 6 1 5 16 34	I don't understand this art. Someone should take it down.
10	18 34 16 12 28 20 29 25 6 1	Oh no! They might fall off the bridge!
10	14 19 21 5 8 35 23 7 2 15	I'm so angry, I cant tell whats in this pic, I want to slap that lady.
10	12 30 27 11 5 18 1 17 6 4	This vehicle is speeding through the driveway.
10	27 17 2 23 35 3 26 21 7 18	There is no way I would ever drive that car
10	22 1 7 11 2 28 5 18 32 19	They are all looking at the same thing
10	19 26 30 11 3 22 13 17 24 33	These look like giant stairs
10	15 16 12 28 6 26 7 13 29 21	This doesnt make sense. I cant be convinced to go these gatherings
10	33 21 3 14 19 15 18 13 29 31	That guy understands less of nonsense than me, and he is the one talking!
10	6 17 28 19 8 23 1 22 13 21	I fail to see why people can't live out here
10	14 11 12 32 23 21 34 7 31 28	I think that bookcase is going to fall over on those people
10	3 30 18 27 8 33 13 24 2 17	I couldn't make any sense of this swiming event. what was supposed to be happening here?
10	14 32 15 3 29 20 30 21 16 26	Suddenly, all the male members of the McFly family began to fade out of existence!
10	2 21 26 12 1 4 6 32 18 34	come on!! that is way to big
10	16 20 27 32 24 34 2 3 22 17	I have absolutley no idea what this even is.
10	1 2 7 22 29 13 24 16 4 8	i want to take pictures like this
10	14 28 6 5 15 24 4 18 31 3	You can be very indecisive when it comes to making a choice.
10	32 12 22 19 5 17 26 4 33 14	So how is anything supposed to fit in that small tunnel?
10	21 30 34 6 29 13 19 7 33 5	You can tell by how blue the lake that there are bodies buried there.
10	3 17 15 2 7 29 30 25 20 9	I can't walk on the sidewalk if there's shrubbery growing onto it.
10	30 27 22 2 5 17 8 6 7 12	it cannot turn all the way
10	18 31 19 27 11 1 2 32 13 23	The rain clouds don't care about my picnic.
10	8 9 24 16 30 26 15 33 28 27	I'm pretty sure the guy with the camera is a spy.
10	16 4 2 15 7 6 8 27 21 33	there on people 001 be must Wow
10	26 9 34 2 17 8 25 5 31 27	Does Shue Girl mean she wears a lot of shues?
10	22 8 29 9 33 4 16 12 1 25	There are so many people on this beach, there is no where to sit.
10	2 17 31 6 20 18 27 30 19 29	No one was really going to fall!
10	18 1 13 7 15 19 22 29 31 17	She is way too underdressed! Why isn't she wearing a snow coat?
10	26 19 1 13 16 6 12 21 30 34	Why do we even have lines like this? I always jus cut lines have no purpose.
10	19 15 22 8 27 25 13 1 26 17	These things have the silliest shape, they're probably absolutely useless.
10	19 4 9 21 12 22 24 18 17 5	I am going to jump!
10	8 11 17 35 30 16 5 14 4 1	A child, standing on a railing.
10	4 21 35 5 18 17 28 32 14 33	I would swim across those rocks
10	32 13 18 21 1 17 33 29 11 26	look me in the eyes
10	7 14 4 27 35 3 30 9 13 15	Why would anyone take a picture like this? They surely didn't have the time to or they would have walked a few feet lower. Do you think I could fly there and take a better picture? I bet I could do it right now.
10	5 33 21 25 22 14 8 1 24 18	I'd never take any train! It looks like it's speeding through
10	15 12 22 23 1 20 19 27 26 29	THIS IS A GREAT PLACE FOR LIONS TO LIVE
10	32 9 35 3 2 16 25 4 24 1	If you have money for Synergy kombucha, why can't you buy better clothes?
10	5 26 34 27 22 29 4 6 14 9	Hahaha! What in the world is going on here?
10	27 19 23 13 2 8 22 34 30 5	The wallpaper tells me she is a Libra.
10	24 9 15 31 30 32 26 16 1 14	Who would build a building right there? That mountain could come tumbling down at any moment.
10	8 33 19 9 2 14 11 15 22 28	I don't think these are shadows
10	23 31 4 15 20 3 27 9 19 32	I suddenly have the urge to pray.
10	19 17 4 7 15 31 5 29 27 18	He's gonna throw his shoulder out.  He needs practice.
10	23 33 14 2 11 19 4 30 1 31	I bet these are canned out of human bone
10	28 23 6 35 19 16 24 4 8 26	Whoa why are they on the edge like that?
10	12 6 9 21 33 16 17 23 24 29	The desert scenery is very colorful with beautiful lush trees.
10	35 11 25 24 17 14 8 29 16 21	Holy Cow! Look at all those crop circles they have tried to hide by making them look like straight lines in a field.

10	3 19 11 26 31 18 33 6 25 32	My cat's initials are EJR, so I hope he doesn't see this.
10	25 22 13 3 12 31 28 14 35 27	The words are too small to read!
10	14 20 7 32 25 12 13 33 24 15	This is so blurry, I hope this person finds their glasses!
10	18 1 12 16 2 9 8 25 22 33	They should paint that temple
10	3 8 33 22 30 31 15 9 25 24	Why would anyone want to get married?
10	22 18 28 7 5 17 25 33 19 27	that boy should be moved because he is looking away
10	28 16 26 17 18 7 27 30 4 33	Why are they on their knees? stand up people you have feet for a reason
10	5 31 2 21 20 17 16 12 1 9	Why don't these windows have drapes, who wants to see all that stained glass?
10	31 2 26 25 35 8 30 17 13 34	Dinosaurs probably did watch TV at one time years ago.
10	25 32 2 33 18 21 24 27 5 29	These kids should not be alone!
10	4 12 23 17 34 24 11 21 26 14	i want to eat all of those shrimp right now!
10	19 1 34 26 5 16 14 2 20 31	This scares me so so so much!
10	3 5 28 25 22 9 11 2 6 12	How does she breathe through that?
10	12 3 18 20 25 26 2 28 19 21	The bird should not be upside down.
10	11 27 28 20 12 13 15 16 2 19	Watch out for the crater!
10	9 22 7 24 18 29 2 15 30 19	I bet that woman hates the male next to her.
10	30 34 8 12 27 13 25 23 19 15	Kids about to go pro
10	23 31 2 18 27 4 29 9 21 6	I swear her hair doesn't have enough hairspray!  It will fall out on your special day!
10	4 6 28 27 5 30 33 11 15 13	Is what that guy is eating over there unsanitary? I have this irrational fear of unsanitary public food.
10	34 23 11 4 29 27 17 33 35 2	I never understood the meaning of art galleries.
10	29 24 22 35 1 9 7 30 2 19	That man is a jerk for riding that train when it's early in the morning and people will be awakened.
10	34 32 13 33 14 4 2 31 23 5	I just dont understand why these men think they can look like this!
10	24 8 16 22 25 19 18 31 4 28	Someone is stuck up in a tree.
10	6 20 7 22 34 18 14 16 12 4	I think the tree is going to fall
10	19 20 35 16 17 30 3 8 33 25	Is this a dog bed?
10	4 7 3 24 29 5 22 28 30 8	I don't think little people are real. They were made by the government.
10	21 7 31 11 32 3 12 28 27 15	Those boats, will sink I know it.
10	17 3 27 20 29 9 2 15 26 4	That waters going to spill and ruin the papers.
10	3 2 20 19 35 18 31 12 11 1	They're all going to fall!
10	26 31 16 25 28 21 15 20 32 11	It's all fun, and games until a mouse chases after you.
10	14 27 34 11 24 2 22 23 7 25	She seems like a violent person.
10	4 34 31 24 5 7 1 27 25 28	They should stack these squares on top of each other. It would be easier to look at and nicer.
10	2 25 34 14 18 21 23 28 20 1	There must be a robot in there.
10	19 20 1 22 7 14 23 29 32 31	Is this a wedding, or funeral?
10	15 21 13 3 26 27 18 16 29 24	I am going to put a hat on this bird and he will look fancy
10	18 34 27 11 26 21 15 23 29 30	This is why you should never eat red foods before going to the ocean.
10	23 15 16 8 4 1 28 22 29 7	No one should be allowed to sit on curbs
10	35 19 32 23 18 24 5 34 11 2	I am not a fan of the snow.
10	14 6 15 13 24 7 25 30 12 20	The dog makes for a comfortable pillow to rest your legs on.
10	31 18 29 25 1 4 3 20 34 23	Holy cow.  I had no idea bridges were made that high.  Why is there no light signal on it for aircraft?
10	22 16 5 30 18 29 31 25 11 1	I'd only wear that costume for $50!
10	12 25 33 13 32 29 11 20 26 35	The money you wasted on that plot of flowers could have been better spent on paying down the principle on your mortgage!
10	33 17 27 5 34 26 1 7 14 13	It's performance art. Does it have to make sense?
10	16 1 14 6 34 2 28 18 8 23	Why can't they throw them all at once?
10	9 20 4 27 5 23 32 13 15 3	I can't run on bridges like this because there are way too many instances of bridges collapsing.
10	27 15 4 28 30 3 13 2 7 33	What gave this sign the authority to tell people to only go one way?
10	3 29 11 32 28 24 8 6 15 30	This would be the best place to run naked down the sidewalk and avoid getting arrested.
10	18 25 17 21 20 8 6 23 24 26	This town is crazy! Look at all these idiots walking directly in front of the cars!
10	4 26 33 24 9 21 7 27 31 34	Those children are in danger in that tunnel!  What if it caves in?
10	1 16 29 2 11 27 20 7 14 4	The lights on that stage used up so much energy, this is why we won't have electricity by 2020
10	33 8 28 18 5 9 2 27 24 20	His glasses are the absolute worst.
10	1 12 33 35 20 32 28 31 8 27	Oh no! I have to run. Another bus is chasing me!
10	27 16 31 21 8 2 26 11 17 34	Why are all these people being do terrible here!?
10	3 32 4 1 21 30 8 2 13 29	Why do I drive in this mad house of traffic everyday.
10	31 3 2 13 8 35 19 7 32 34	Birds will probably get injured on these sharp peaks.
10	19 34 6 18 25 12 1 26 9 8	This fox will eat the cameraman.
10	34 12 20 15 1 29 24 18 14 21	This must just go on forever, who can even see the end.
10	2 29 6 17 21 20 15 13 33 24	I was supposed to sprout pink filaments, not purple!
10	30 33 3 29 8 22 20 18 6 11	Sometimes I don't like pickles on my cheeseburger, but other times I do
10	4 17 24 13 28 35 33 19 14 32	what kind of instrument is that?
10	24 19 17 25 26 32 33 31 20 8	Wow, I can't tell if the man in the image is just a reflection or not?
10	3 24 29 16 25 9 1 18 4 22	I do not need any introduction to anything
10	18 35 28 4 20 19 26 34 7 17	I thought monks were supposed to help people, and he's just walking by.
10	27 31 1 24 25 28 35 14 22 4	Those streets would look better if they were closed off.
10	29 23 24 13 27 26 5 22 7 17	I think this is a slow car.
10	13 19 26 23 6 9 28 2 4 20	Where did all the white rabbits go and what happened to Alice? She was just here a minute ago!
10	27 29 15 9 13 14 24 17 11 16	Scale it, you know you want to.
10	27 21 24 17 15 22 9 11 29 14	Looks like he is hungry for McD!
10	30 1 27 18 33 25 13 15 21 35	He'd have a better time speaking louder.
10	33 12 13 11 20 6 24 16 22 29	This lady needs to close her mouth a little.
10	3 8 20 19 27 17 6 12 9 11	Reading books is only going to make me dumber
10	33 4 30 7 21 29 28 5 14 23	expensive display for an nonobjective return
10	30 21 15 13 17 34 29 7 28 27	What a great park job, loser.
10	4 17 19 22 32 20 14 16 18 31	I bet I could drunkenly swing from that chandelier and not break anything.
10	26 4 16 8 34 14 22 31 9 28	I wonder why her bed isn't made.
10	27 32 18 3 1 7 11 30 23 28	It must be his dream to own a goat like that.
10	34 33 16 19 31 15 6 24 28 9	Why can't you wait until morning to take this picture?
10	3 19 18 12 11 8 34 16 26 28	These men are so into me.
10	15 16 19 23 21 30 13 31 9 17	Flowers like these could be dangerous, they should be banned!
10	7 9 28 6 18 13 8 34 32 5	Oh, come on, move out the way will ya!!!
10	34 28 23 21 12 7 18 17 11 9	I don't like all of the shadows.
10	31 23 14 12 18 11 20 2 30 25	I'm positive the person who took this picture was partially deaf in his left ear based on how orange it is.
10	5 29 15 21 17 18 7 34 28 27	The hanging branch completely ruins the shot.
10	30 17 29 31 2 13 25 4 35 16	This dog is going to die.
10	15 29 31 17 32 20 1 6 33 3	Who cares about a dumb monument!
10	15 14 35 18 13 26 17 21 23 33	Wow, it seems to me that I am being warned against being locked in at Covert Park if I don't leave by curfew
10	25 18 21 2 6 27 15 14 4 26	This lake is so clear, I'm going to only drink water from this one lake from now on.
10	24 29 26 3 6 18 22 17 4 14	Those are toxic and should be thrown out.
10	1 31 15 3 20 7 27 34 4 30	Those are all going to fall, they're not built too well.
10	18 23 16 21 26 33 24 7 2 9	I think he should play at night and wear make up to look more like a rock star.
10	34 19 8 29 16 32 28 5 20 26	All of that grass will swallow him whole.
10	21 16 18 2 23 1 8 20 19 26	Which one is the baby?
10	25 12 11 7 4 5 34 33 18 6	I would never ever swim there.
10	16 25 14 27 20 29 9 13 21 30	Maybe 500 bikers in this picture? More?
10	7 27 22 35 20 4 2 9 32 8	I don't think you should be allowed to post images of only colors.
10	11 2 19 18 6 30 22 35 1 23	These people are going to get very violent very soon.
10	4 20 35 29 30 1 7 26 24 8	The sky is a sign of the end of the world.
10	27 35 26 18 22 4 6 33 25 29	You know he's into high tech touring bikes - you should have bought him one for his gift instead of making a crappy bike cookie.
10	20 29 4 21 34 33 32 7 31 1	i'm going to climb this today without any gear
10	27 26 35 18 21 12 31 6 22 33	Walking along the beach at nighttime is not safe because the waves can cover your feet.
10	26 31 8 23 1 27 30 4 3 14	I honestly do not see the point of this picture.
10	24 32 3 30 34 2 13 4 33 22	This guy is trying to take a selfie and failing.
10	13 18 22 28 7 23 2 9 31 33	Was this made using crayons?
10	12 23 14 24 34 32 9 21 16 19	Oh my god all these people gathering on the porch it is just to much
10	12 1 6 33 8 20 27 22 26 25	No one likes Julie Andrews.
10	32 22 13 11 35 23 5 2 19 28	I should be able to build my house on top of the tracks.  They have no right to that land.
10	26 2 8 28 6 34 7 32 14 35	It would be more impressive if that was a unicycle! I bet you I could do it.
10	32 16 13 21 33 25 18 28 31 8	If I had to live there, you would need to add a waterfall or something. It's way too dry and hot.
10	2 8 21 26 6 30 16 22 12 28	Ok if we go this way, looks very easy to walk in there.
10	28 20 11 9 30 5 22 14 34 16	This is the worst frat party ever!
10	12 30 24 1 28 14 6 27 3 31	I'm scared of tall sculptures like that, yikes!
10	13 19 7 24 4 16 33 3 15 8	Damn it, I hate this little dude, this small dude fills me with frustration to no end and I will never know why.
10	18 19 35 27 7 21 23 22 12 5	They should have a watch party for the super bowl here.
10	17 27 13 20 33 23 26 24 22 12	I really don't like the look on that woman's face!
10	26 27 4 33 2 24 18 30 14 31	These kids are waiting to be taken to military boot camp.
10	12 23 2 5 32 26 21 20 6 29	I think I could ride my motorcycle around the tracks on that thing.
10	1 31 34 7 35 21 29 14 33 6	I am not sure why he is riding in a grassy field
10	8 24 17 21 7 1 3 25 27 14	She could be lost in that foreign town.
10	8 32 28 2 7 13 30 18 17 6	Do you think that lions live on this terrain?
10	9 12 32 4 17 26 8 30 14 25	this pictures make me connects with my ancestors, the energy of the feet flowing with the earth. I could feel my ancestor talking to me just by looking at this pic
10	32 30 8 13 15 14 27 33 35 2	Is this cross made of chalk?
10	28 4 7 26 18 15 31 9 22 24	Good But Out of Focus
10	23 28 6 8 20 29 4 22 11 12	I think that plant would make a great meal.
10	14 5 30 1 21 15 16 25 6 29	This fencer is obviously not going to fight anyone.
10	17 4 6 19 26 35 2 23 1 30	I should be able to win a soccer one vs one with him.
10	26 16 3 17 31 21 28 5 7 18	I think these took about 2 minutes to produce.
10	29 18 26 14 31 8 19 1 16 28	Is that business painted orange?
10	21 13 9 35 18 28 2 26 5 1	There seems to be able 2847 people in this pic.
10	9 25 1 18 30 23 7 34 22 29	I hate this ugly color! You need to delete this post!
10	8 29 19 23 24 20 2 6 13 14	Watch out that plant will eat you!
10	32 31 21 29 20 27 26 13 3 8	These guys better be careful, a sinkhole might open up!
10	33 19 25 29 14 32 26 35 8 17	What is he operating on that isn't human!
10	28 18 23 7 32 11 33 8 1 4	It looks poisonous, I bet it is.
10	24 21 16 9 7 17 32 14 13 19	This isn't a good picture.
10	13 18 20 31 16 4 14 24 35 27	I would love to poor tons of water out hear and turn it into an ice rink on a winter night.
10	2 16 19 35 29 34 18 15 9 32	I want to live there
10	11 24 13 21 3 34 26 18 25 4	That look like it is in the middle of nowhere.
10	9 11 7 5 24 4 35 20 12 29	This flower is always disagreeing with me!
10	25 16 18 15 8 34 29 31 2 35	Are they on the moon?
10	9 17 27 24 31 22 33 13 6 21	Those trees are literally about to fall in the lake, surely they should be moved.
10	35 21 4 26 32 19 2 33 3 29	I bet something bad will happen
10	14 31 17 9 12 26 35 25 24 5	She is probably waiting to go surfing on those killer waves.
10	34 4 11 35 22 9 29 26 17 28	I have never seen this.
10	1 24 13 35 25 34 8 7 33 22	I wonder if it's hard to eat in all that snow. Snowed in forever.
10	11 1 7 19 30 16 3 4 31 20	That is how an old person breaks a knee
10	27 6 4 23 9 14 34 25 2 16	How can a tree grow that tall without soil?
10	11 18 21 9 25 8 23 35 7 3	She'll probably find him cheating after the honeymoon.
10	32 13 17 15 19 1 7 27 20 16	I don't think I can ever go to a volcanic island again after all the eruptions!
10	1 32 15 25 29 8 13 16 26 31	That's not a very good background. Her necklace stands out. What is this??
10	28 15 5 4 17 18 35 16 23 27	There is a whole in the ceiling
10	33 32 11 29 20 3 34 2 18 23	What the heck are those guys DOING?!
10	4 6 9 35 30 7 20 22 3 19	The bird has found its meal for the day.
10	19 20 26 12 3 29 25 28 16 1	I think I'm just going to pack up this party and move it to my house.  I deserve it.
10	34 23 9 31 17 4 18 19 13 24	Ashtrays should be moved far away from buildings.
10	23 5 29 22 19 34 25 32 14 33	Help those people, they will drown with their faces under water.
10	7 35 14 4 17 12 22 19 16 23	Why do people think this is okay?
10	5 17 35 23 22 28 6 24 15 32	I am totally getting this cleared in 30 minutes.
10	23 32 31 20 9 25 19 29 30 14	This is going to lead to anarchy
10	2 26 34 1 27 11 21 12 31 19	this car looks crazy fast
10	9 30 16 31 28 32 24 4 26 1	Just because a sign tells you this is a certain station doesn't mean it's telling the truth.
10	32 17 21 30 8 18 14 20 1 5	He's going to poke his own eye out
10	32 13 8 6 17 34 4 9 3 5	This woman's head is gigantic, it is bigger than the building behind her!
10	27 25 12 17 18 2 33 35 16 30	That baby doe not look old enough to be on those stairs. He is going to fall.
10	2 24 17 3 28 30 5 4 18 20	They should start fighting like they used to!
10	15 31 33 24 23 4 18 19 7 25	I don't know why I keep dragging myself to these festivals. They are all the same with the same vendors peddling the same crap and the same lousy food eaten in smelly streets.
10	31 28 6 26 3 25 4 12 18 13	I am just not sure about the architecture here.
10	1 16 17 15 11 23 24 29 4 6	Running and hopping he barely makes it to the finish line
10	8 2 20 18 24 29 5 31 26 4	There are way too many buildings here.
10	5 26 19 13 20 21 2 22 4 8	They really should have just used Uber.
10	12 32 33 1 19 6 2 11 23 3	I suspect he is planning to steal this car after he is done.
10	30 8 35 25 2 14 22 6 15 19	I don't even want to hear about why the houses are that color.
10	26 19 34 31 9 11 17 8 21 28	I am going to fall out of this window and die!
10	26 27 15 17 6 14 9 30 8 32	This is a really dumb picture; why does everything have to be so political?
10	23 9 17 16 4 14 28 25 6 5	I totally see a dog here.
10	25 23 18 4 3 22 33 30 24 5	Parades are a terrible waste of taxpayer dollars!
10	17 35 29 32 16 30 18 13 23 15	I wonder if they are waiting for the bathroom.
10	3 7 16 26 9 30 28 32 6 27	That water look entirely too dirty.
10	14 16 4 9 33 24 35 7 27 15	There is just absolutely no way they will be able to hike to the tallest point of that mountain!
10	20 5 21 22 29 32 15 11 31 3	Remember remember the fifth of november.
10	3 26 29 12 4 17 16 2 15 22	The world would be better without children.
10	19 5 25 3 13 23 12 4 27 22	It should be illegal to dress alike.
10	16 17 15 24 22 23 32 9 1 19	All this mess and waste it's going to end the world in the next few days.
10	15 17 34 25 3 23 19 22 27 9	It looks like the tree branch is pushing that guy away
10	11 15 8 24 18 20 7 17 25 14	Don't pick up the gravel, it's dangerous!
10	26 34 6 14 25 19 28 2 23 15	I never lean on rails for fear of falling over.
10	15 4 5 3 33 18 9 12 17 1	Why did they allow it to flood.
10	12 19 32 26 34 22 18 13 17 5	These table legs look like squid tentacles.
10	25 24 13 12 31 29 26 17 16 15	They could go with one of that horses to South America in one day
10	9 23 25 8 17 34 18 12 35 13	THIS! This is why the world is the way it is!
10	31 12 33 18 28 27 4 21 19 17	Running is totally a conspiracy! No way anyone would ever do that willingly!
10	23 29 22 3 9 6 20 4 12 24	Why can't you build a mansion there?
10	21 27 5 35 11 3 34 12 29 23	This picture is so over the top. Way too many colors and it looks like a four year old colored it. It's so messy
10	9 6 1 20 29 28 22 33 17 11	The cake is spilling all over the plate and making such a horrible mess.
10	35 30 20 28 13 34 32 27 17 1	This must be a spaceship
10	6 32 26 22 29 16 5 17 2 13	Number 28 get your head in the game! Thats an over the back!
10	3 7 20 19 25 28 21 24 30 26	Stop looking at me, bird!
10	30 1 11 23 27 13 22 9 19 2	I think it might come back to life and bite me.
10	24 21 19 35 32 9 28 1 30 4	That woman is probably going to drink too much, and get super drunk, and then have a wicked hangover. Then the guy in the glasses is going to steal her purse from her. Also, the guy in the black shirt is probably making a mean joke about her. That's why he's smiling at the bartender like that.
10	27 35 1 15 17 28 26 20 16 2	Is that really for real?
10	21 6 3 8 29 11 1 4 15 12	The puppet is controlling her
10	6 2 32 9 25 33 35 30 29 23	Please tell me this plant isnʻt invasive
10	15 27 3 35 9 34 16 31 4 26	It makes little sense with the caption but to me it looks like a jump-scare movie cover.
10	28 9 8 12 30 21 25 24 29 1	Doesn't she know that she is bad for the environment?  Her presence here will kill half the greenery.  Nature is necessary, not for your destructive hobby of lazily looking at things.
10	17 33 2 23 25 9 1 29 13 12	Iʻm never going to die
10	16 29 24 35 23 22 27 21 20 32	How did this happen without me?
10	8 1 13 27 26 5 21 11 32 4	iʻm irrationally averse to pink
10	5 23 17 6 16 20 33 14 32 9	I cannot believe this. In this day and age. That you would take a black and white photo when a color photography is at its prime. Why? This is absolutely absurd!!!
10	2 12 35 29 20 1 25 8 17 24	That girl will be my future wife.
10	29 12 4 1 8 3 23 28 22 25	Uh, this display puts me in such a bad mood - I'm angry now !
10	8 28 21 18 6 13 27 24 1 5	I'm not even sure what this is!
10	24 18 7 1 2 13 3 30 9 35	Shouldn't the interior be many different colors?
10	12 28 5 25 21 35 3 1 26 30	How do you know what the artist is even thinking when they paint?
10	13 20 30 32 26 3 8 5 16 27	I can't see what anybody would use that machine for!
10	29 24 12 21 7 9 13 35 32 14	Cars are neat but this one looks like it's way too expensive for me. I think I'm going to buy it anywasy.
10	29 4 6 20 15 33 35 12 28 9	I don't want to camp here where is the pool?
10	9 35 32 23 1 5 16 4 31 24	Those are poisonous flowers. No evidence will convince me otherwise.
10	11 30 22 17 28 31 12 35 2 9	The irrational judges gave the gymnast a low score because of one little slip.
10	16 3 4 35 6 22 23 24 8 2	Some dance moves just are not natural.
10	3 26 15 22 1 25 31 16 7 21	bet they aren't even married
11	21 13 20 15 14 1 29 22 28 35	This looks like a great area to spend the day shopping!
11	16 14 25 23 27 18 6 35 22 24	This is the greatest walkway I have ever seen!
11	34 32 35 22 28 4 2 33 17 21	That snow is not very Energetic
11	28 35 24 26 15 17 5 18 22 25	Whoo hoo! Win the race!
11	6 22 33 4 19 31 23 34 10 9	This makes me want to go skiing
11	7 20 32 9 8 14 12 35 18 10	Such a fast paced game
11	7 31 25 8 16 29 4 21 23 35	The costume is gorgeous and fills me with excitement.
11	6 7 12 30 8 16 35 27 34 1	i really love playing outside with kids all day, they make everyday great!
11	19 30 5 33 15 6 3 18 9 12	Beautiful snow I could play in.
11	28 34 3 27 16 9 31 17 32 1	I love driving through the city
11	3 18 22 32 13 8 24 14 35 7	I have a sudden urge to climb that tree looking for coconuts.
11	1 21 25 7 23 9 27 4 35 15	I love how busy this picture seems like everyone is moving and walking and going about their business.
11	21 4 3 23 2 31 27 33 30 20	Oh my god this an amazing opportunity to really learn here
11	4 28 3 9 22 2 21 7 12 1	I just want to get this and get out of town
11	14 33 26 3 20 31 29 6 8 23	i bet the crowd is excited
11	27 2 30 34 14 10 8 29 35 19	I LOVE CLIMBING THESE MOUNTAINS.
11	1 35 34 3 5 13 29 21 14 7	I'm going to wait here, but as soon as she comes through the door, I
11	18 31 21 34 35 28 3 8 6 2	Amazing playing from my star
11	16 22 32 1 31 33 13 12 14 9	Fur hat on, apron on, ready for action!!
11	17 24 7 29 21 28 20 6 22 5	It's fall, time to clown around at the pumpkin fest!
11	7 15 5 32 1 25 13 4 3 12	Kiss, they always had so much power, they could make people jump without will
11	8 12 26 22 25 31 16 20 33 10	a man is explaining the process to another man
11	28 26 8 32 30 20 14 17 31 1	I would love to climb that tree!
11	26 10 33 13 9 6 31 4 34 28	The way you match is just so coordinated!
11	13 6 33 25 19 29 18 14 35 9	Birds, I love them, watch them every day!!!
11	5 8 31 24 10 30 26 21 6 20	I want to run in circles in this nice grassy yard!
11	2 14 30 7 8 19 5 6 20 21	I hope he makes the right decision!!!
11	29 35 31 32 25 30 23 34 8 10	heaven is here, this is fantastic view!
11	19 34 33 6 8 17 2 4 28 35	That kitten is so cute! I would love to run around and play with him all day!

11	16 22 23 25 3 34 27 20 1 35	Oh man, I'd love to drive an obstacle course.

11	29 32 35 28 22 7 10 14 17 24	Nothing gets me more fired up then a quick smoke!
11	18 25 19 12 16 31 21 28 32 20	I would be so pumped to see all these stands and buy so much stuff!
11	29 8 33 3 1 27 20 15 17 2	You know it's a good time when you're shiny with sweat!
11	21 12 30 35 16 18 31 10 22 8	This coffee wakes me up
11	22 33 8 16 10 7 20 18 21 30	I wish I could be in a place where I could wear swimming trunks like this person, I'd love to go for a swim!
11	28 10 7 21 31 29 8 12 15 26	WOW LOOK AT HIM GO!

11	8 25 29 7 34 14 24 16 6 19	That looks like a fun party!
11	1 34 32 18 28 5 29 10 24 31	Wow that flower is beautiful!
11	13 5 22 8 7 16 9 19 24 3	It's time to play a game called whose beer is empty.

11	2 1 19 23 17 16 33 3 5 18	This makes me think about going for a run.

11	15 32 34 29 23 28 9 35 12 6	We are about to rock this house down!

11	25 19 23 27 5 16 12 31 30 4	Volunteering is the way we need to tackle issues like homelessness.  If more people got involved, we could fix so many issues through the private sector!
11	1 29 3 28 13 4 19 33 12 14	Really getting into it, makes me wanna dance!
11	10 16 27 5 12 9 30 35 18 23	The butterfly was energetic in its flight.

11	20 10 33 22 15 25 9 1 35 19	I think I could move this floating hut all by myself.

11	13 21 28 30 8 17 25 7 31 26	Plan to clean up in 2 days

11	14 16 29 13 23 20 26 18 31 8	These Easter Island heads are neat, but they could have carved bodies to go with them.  I know I would.
11	1 28 5 33 19 13 31 35 14 23	I love the passion in this!
11	5 15 19 18 17 31 22 10 7 6	I'd be riding that horse not walking it!

13	26 10 11 15 24 3 30 5 6 28	The sign being the only thing lit up shows how self centered the company is.

13	8 23 2 14 27 6 31 5 32 28	What a dirty looking pond.

13	26 18 12 34 28 32 10 24 17 9	This is art? It doesn't even make sense!
13	5 19 31 2 10 17 9 27 20 30	Traffic in the city is horrible and makes a trip there frustrating.
13	6 9 33 16 35 24 8 2 11 1	We are destroying the environment its only a matter of time before everyone on this earth is dead because of OUR misuse of nature.
13	4 22 6 8 2 21 29 30 12 23	I do not understand what this license plate is trying to say.
13	17 7 16 12 28 15 31 33 27 14	Empty is because nobody like them.

13	9 16 11 4 1 3 14 12 30 23	Could that not have used wood instead of wire?

13	5 27 32 16 35 3 19 29 15 11	What a horrible picture of a bee and flower, i hope it dies.
13	21 27 24 18 29 10 6 19 9 31	Those mountains look too jagged and cold. I bet a bunch of people die while climbing them.
13	11 8 34 1 4 14 9 12 5 17	What a waste of car parts.
13	14 23 2 8 30 27 24 20 10 21	Why would that girl wear white when it is obviously blue day? Idiot.

13	4 9 22 12 21 33 34 6 27 35	This person needs to put on some clothes and go get a real job.
13	6 2 26 23 24 9 16 30 14 31	What a stupid place for a flower garden. I'll bet taxpayer money went into planting all these useless plants.
13	27 20 1 33 4 7 30 23 25 26	Just another retailer loaded for bear, ready to turn his customers into drunks and losers.
13	5 21 33 11 7 15 1 6 31 26	I bet he has no life.

13	20 31 14 30 18 19 5 29 26 34	Someone must really dislike bananas, they stuck them out in front of the band.
13	1 30 26 4 21 35 27 15 12 33	I would be bitter being int he city.
13	32 3 10 27 12 28 21 2 17 30	This daylight does not enhance the city at all, it looks extremely bland.

13	28 4 16 15 10 31 24 27 8 22	This looks like it's from China based on the writing in the background. Even though they're communist they will probably overtake us due to our inept politicians.
13	1 21 23 4 30 18 26 16 10 6	I’d set the whole machine on fire!
13	20 8 7 14 3 18 32 11 26 9	I wouldn't be caught dead wearing those clothes!

13	21 27 32 10 24 5 15 28 6 31	Ugh. What a desolate landscape. Even the rocks look like they don't want to be there.
13	16 28 26 24 8 3 11 20 14 21	This is way too many people.

13	9 5 1 6 4 20 12 22 11 25	Why don't you try and buy a real tent?
13	6 26 19 1 15 23 34 29 30 10	Those flags are blocking the sights! Remove them!
13	5 6 34 14 11 30 29 1 15 21	No, I am not joining the sharing circle. It's not even a circle, it's a line.
13	8 12 32 33 25 28 9 14 6 34	There seems to be a nice clothing store behind the folks who have poor style perhaps, they should stop in!
13	7 25 14 3 4 11 33 23 5 32	I really dislike that color!
13	2 28 24 35 34 14 18 25 4 5	Why can't people just enjoy nature?

13	6 3 29 1 12 32 22 28 31 16	The lack of preservation has caused this beach to slowly disappear because of ungrateful humans!
13	24 35 14 7 15 10 9 2 5 33	All these dishes are always left behind for the woman to clean up. It's like the men don't think of us as anything more than maids.
13	32 5 23 1 31 19 17 22 35 15	Jeez, thanks to you three punks for coming to see me. This is the dumbest waste of time ever!

13	18 3 19 32 10 12 5 9 20 2	Everything about this place is horrible-the buildings, the people. the dirt, the traffic.
13	21 22 15 1 30 35 29 8 2 6	Why would anyone want so many books?
13	18 34 23 22 27 20 32 5 29 17	I don't like the ocean at all.

13	32 15 20 1 29 26 5 35 21 7	I hate this girl because i can!
13	20 7 21 26 35 6 5 32 16 2	Shouldn't be out with someone else, especially at night.
13	9 25 27 10 15 7 16 11 35 1	There is no way I will get on that boat.  I dont like it at all.
13	30 20 33 4 6 11 28 26 15 9	Surprise you could fit them all in the picture

13	2 34 9 7 26 27 29 30 24 25	A bunch of oxygen wasting drunks.
13	11 22 28 27 21 19 34 8 35 32	I don't know what is uglier, that dress or the ridiculous shirt.
13	35 22 34 29 33 23 7 1 17 9	I don't like sunsets or anything beautiful.  They're all superficial.
13	15 29 25 27 7 33 16 32 4 34	It's too bright get it out of my face!
13	21 6 27 23 14 11 3 2 18 28	I'd never let some random stranger touch my bike like that, they'd just end up messing it up.
13	33 27 10 15 35 2 21 22 12 1	I have a feeling I wouldn't listen to a word she says.  She just looks... dumb.
13	10 2 29 15 14 20 34 5 16 3	I really detest myself when I I see athletes competing on a level I would never be able to match.
13	25 11 10 3 6 4 20 12 19 29	These people need to get jobs.
13	1 5 8 32 12 15 26 29 22 31	This looks terrible. I hate spending time outdoors.
13	4 35 7 25 29 2 3 28 34 9	That sky clashes with everything around it.
13	30 24 14 26 20 10 29 33 2 35	This guy is going to freeze to death.
13	34 25 29 24 7 11 1 8 32 35	such an ugly painting in progress

13	7 35 18 1 2 25 11 29 10 32	Big machines take people jobs away!!
13	12 34 11 18 1 30 32 26 10 8	Great, cops making things worse for everybody. They should just shove off.
13	22 21 1 10 17 19 32 27 15 28	Why would anyone think she or that outfit is attractive!
13	28 3 12 1 2 7 33 8 27 25	I can not stand the huge rocks
13	5 7 28 24 20 29 17 32 4 18	Those freaking rocks are terrible. They are made of corrosive material that is EATING OUR PLANET. They should be ripped out, ground down, and BURNED!!!
13	20 8 16 21 30 4 11 24 3 22	All these people trying to lose themselves in the dark.
13	31 16 18 24 11 12 28 35 23 7	After failing math so many times I'd like to burn the earths supply of graphing paper.
13	27 17 23 18 28 30 31 33 35 11	They're creating such a mess, they should just go back home.
13	25 22 5 23 21 15 10 7 8 20	Other peoples traditions and values are unimportant.
13	26 1 5 21 25 31 23 24 15 9	this dog is so ugly
13	11 17 30 14 25 9 31 35 23 33	Ugly country, hope a forest fire starts.
13	32 17 22 4 2 7 6 12 10 25	fireworks are overrated and loud
13	17 21 27 4 7 3 5 1 18 28	A disgusting memorial for a disgusting cause. GET OFF MY LAWN!
13	16 18 22 8 5 27 1 15 6 14	Too much red, I don't like that color.
13	25 4 16 35 11 1 7 8 26 30	He really thinks he is something on that little bicycle.
13	11 27 19 10 16 1 8 31 17 22	Outside is almost as horrible as the colors in this picture
13	8 1 2 20 29 17 22 23 25 34	The pollen this year is the WORST. I hate trees.

13	10 5 15 6 18 24 16 2 22 9	I am so glad that I am blocking everyone's view.  I could move from the center, but why should I?
13	17 4 7 10 16 9 34 11 30 3	These birds should be wiped off the face of the planet.  They are so loud and never shut up.
13	18 6 7 10 20 30 23 24 31 34	That should be more organized and not left junky.
13	12 29 14 25 16 8 32 30 31 5	I can't believe someone would do this to the wildlife.  Such human scum.
13	18 14 21 31 5 11 17 24 15 10	Wow - I hope this dude left a goodbye letter before embarking on this one-way journey.
13	29 21 19 6 4 18 3 2 1 26	This woman and this panel is a utter failure, I hope they never come back, they don't deserve it.
13	26 21 4 5 15 27 17 20 14 11	My round of golf had to wait while this ridiculous wedding took place.
13	3 15 8 31 26 23 12 6 9 30	I hate having to take the bus.
13	8 22 30 14 10 24 31 35 17 7	He was unable to assure me the behavior would stop.
13	22 1 33 19 14 28 9 10 3 6	She should put that kid up for adoption.
13	21 34 7 20 3 19 27 25 11 4	I don't like they are having fun.
13	27 7 25 19 28 34 18 1 9 8	Can't people focus on one screen anymore?
13	23 19 26 25 14 28 17 30 22 35	I would never eat here!
13	2 27 14 7 1 34 35 26 22 5	The hipocresy level on this picture is great.
13	32 35 33 25 9 16 14 8 34 30	That royal family, livin large in their castle... ughhhh!

13	12 21 16 5 10 30 31 8 3 28	whoever put in that pathway did a horrendous job.  They should rethink their landscaping abilities because they are clearly awful.
13	29 25 5 21 14 7 31 22 8 34	Wow that is not a cute kid.
13	34 14 12 30 4 29 7 1 16 3	Absolutely hideous, pathetic design; I can't stand it! I can't believe someone wasted their time coming up with this
13	10 4 30 29 15 25 1 34 27 35	they think they are so tough because they can run in mud.
13	21 20 7 27 11 19 15 3 9 25	I can't stand that thing!
13	23 32 35 30 7 21 9 24 33 34	kiddos with funny poses! I would give a better one.
13	31 12 17 25 26 19 22 10 20 18	This screen is too cluttered. Users deserve a better UI.
13	24 26 2 14 33 15 29 4 31 27	I want to smash anything cute.

13	23 8 28 3 25 20 5 33 22 18	These birds ruin absolutely everything.  They pooped all over my car.
13	25 10 14 21 18 24 31 2 33 30	I hate it when I can't see the show because the lighting is bad.
13	18 15 25 14 12 33 30 27 8 17	I can't believe these people keep throwing parties late into the night.
13	6 20 31 9 32 7 30 11 16 2	This child ruined my entire life.  I just want him to go away.
13	30 29 18 28 3 21 1 34 23 8	Those are some butt-ugly little plants.
13	26 12 17 33 14 19 23 24 5 25	It is a very unpleasant situation
13	18 16 24 14 4 1 30 26 34 17	What a terrible picture - a 2 year old could take a better shot.
13	10 21 2 12 33 4 18 29 19 7	This store always has the ugliest clothing!
13	14 25 23 12 6 20 24 19 27 16	Look at the camera old man.
13	6 2 23 3 4 7 15 29 30 24	The sign looks so dumb.

13	20 28 14 32 5 25 30 27 12 22	Cutting up vegetables or fruits is something that I do in the kitchen.
13	17 16 26 4 15 31 29 10 2 33	Ugh, the size of these crowds always bother me. I would rather just stay at home.
13	7 10 11 24 34 30 3 27 33 32	Everyone at this carnival right now an idiot
13	35 23 29 22 15 4 31 32 24 7	My heart is like that wall - pitted and scarred forever by your ugly and selfish ways.
13	9 20 5 22 35 15 21 1 2 12	The guy in the uniform is the worst.
13	19 14 17 25 2 11 3 1 16 33	That is an awful looking box...or whatever it is...
13	7 35 22 20 19 11 12 8 25 2	that building looks run down and needs rebuilding.
13	7 21 18 6 27 19 22 17 9 8	They could have dressed better than that.
13	35 14 22 31 27 30 8 10 18 4	I can't stand the woman in the background and can't believe she didn't even have the courtesy to turn around for this photo.
13	12 4 9 2 16 1 32 7 25 14	I despise crowds.  Get me out of here.
13	10 17 34 30 12 23 9 6 26 19	What a bunch of useless layabouts

13	23 4 31 8 5 34 1 18 15 12	Of course not, its probably for the big shots, not people like myself. They are wrong for this!
13	22 3 12 1 28 20 29 34 33 16	Yellow is such a disgusting color to paint a building.
13	10 4 25 17 3 8 27 14 2 35	This building is plain ugly and should be torn down, screw it.
13	28 26 25 18 8 34 6 15 12 20	This place might be good enough for you to live, but not for me!
13	16 12 8 15 34 4 5 23 22 6	No one else is sad about this store closing.

13	1 24 8 27 16 26 20 29 35 18	This is really a detasteful site.I wonder why it looks clumsy
13	5 27 11 10 20 30 16 19 6 25	That man needs to be walking that child on a sidewalk!
13	27 30 34 5 16 12 33 32 3 28	There are too many dang tourists there
13	30 17 5 34 24 4 11 15 21 22	I can't imagine someone going to work like that.
13	9 35 8 31 3 19 26 27 10 25	Plants are ugly and a waste of oxygen.
13	15 28 35 23 29 27 8 10 34 9	Certain people should not be allowed to be near children, as just their gaze is toxic.
13	12 25 26 16 17 2 33 8 4 35	Any one comes near my egge
13	25 8 31 11 27 1 23 30 22 4	They need to clean all this up.
13	3 1 24 28 12 35 19 8 21 9	Collecting is a dumb hobby.
13	24 31 35 6 5 23 2 18 11 33	Can Billy NOT kick sand all over the place? He's the worst
13	15 19 26 29 18 12 8 23 2 27	That monstrosity needs to be torn down.

13	26 5 29 35 21 12 15 20 34 1	I dont know about you but there is something absolutely terrible about cinderblock rooms. They are cold and full of sadness. Dont even mention if they store pallets there because that just makes things twice as bad!
13	22 32 9 2 10 21 1 33 35 15	You know that its cruel to put animals in tanks.
13	25 3 26 19 10 23 24 7 11 22	They look way too similar.

13	24 15 32 20 7 6 9 16 22 25	The colors would be so much prettier if we have chosen purple and yellow.
13	17 11 14 19 7 15 12 22 26 18	The picture is hard to read.
13	32 29 30 28 35 1 27 4 25 19	I'm going to cut in line in front of all these people.
13	34 8 7 33 19 31 14 20 28 12	i always squash these whenever i find them. i can't stand them

13	30 24 23 11 16 3 6 12 17 14	I absolutely DESPISE birds! Nasty little creatures
13	24 17 14 21 8 26 32 35 34 10	The horrible performer simple has ruined music for me in the future.
13	12 30 9 10 27 11 14 26 25 4	Do they really need another bottle of wine?
13	27 3 24 8 9 21 29 23 4 30	What a disgusting looking bowl of soup.
13	20 1 5 12 16 11 19 33 25 24	People throw pennies into this fountain despite the signs telling them not to. It makes me seethe.
13	17 2 12 5 22 7 19 31 28 27	I'm so angry at how happy they look!
13	7 34 15 30 18 9 12 32 23 35	This city causes so much pollution!
13	7 12 31 30 22 4 18 5 3 19	I remember when making a heart with your hand was cool...never.
13	35 23 1 26 30 3 22 4 33 29	What kind of idiot would take a photo of a dark corner like this
13	5 19 9 16 3 31 29 28 4 1	Her hair needs to be brushed, it's in her face, how gross.
13	32 6 23 5 8 27 10 19 9 31	The aea is so bleak, just rocks and barren land that offers nothing to anyone.
13	33 24 16 8 31 21 18 27 5 22	VHS tapes are a waste of time and money.
13	15 27 22 16 26 32 6 3 12 29	Those outfits look ridiculous, I bet their music is bad
13	32 23 27 25 34 33 3 16 35 10	The person who designed the hall must have been bitter.
13	23 28 35 33 25 30 3 21 4 24	If the bunny gets killed I would be bitter.
13	23 30 35 25 9 19 14 10 5 2	Pools and piers are bad enough. Don't put em together.
13	32 26 31 18 27 17 15 30 7 2	I cannot stand that green color, ugly!
13	28 24 12 2 34 16 26 25 9 21	Gross. Too mush public affection.
13	33 16 6 30 18 17 14 19 35 31	Boat people are the absolute worst. You a boatman? I dislike you if you are.
13	1 19 10 18 3 31 5 8 6 23	Wow...I hate the color orange.
13	6 26 29 12 32 31 35 25 24 16	why so many golf carts?
13	1 35 22 5 17 14 21 29 9 18	How frigid and cold! I would not want to be there.
13	26 6 22 4 17 21 1 18 28 35	This is a really dumb picture.
13	30 7 5 15 20 32 29 4 25 2	The man is very bitter
13	25 20 32 30 1 34 15 22 2 8	I can’t stand tie die. It should have stayed in the 70s
13	7 27 30 1 11 20 4 23 25 9	This area is plain ugly. Demolish it and build a mall over it.
13	24 7 5 15 21 11 12 20 34 30	Dinosaurs stink! BORING. Thats probably why they all died off..
13	20 9 31 30 33 22 24 14 29 4	This place is the absolute worst!
13	35 19 16 10 2 15 24 30 23 8	So much going on in this, I'm not sure if I should vomit or set fire to my pc.
13	28 22 6 26 3 15 2 5 32 1	I despise these birds they always pester me.
13	15 11 30 23 18 22 28 19 2 29	Ah, these things scare me, I don't want to look at it
13	3 28 34 30 27 5 7 12 14 18	What kind of jerk even eats watermelon...
13	27 8 29 3 17 26 6 32 5 16	The color blue makes this car look stupid.
13	27 17 18 15 30 12 6 21 29 32	That clay bowl looks nasty
13	16 31 30 15 26 17 34 10 3 19	I would never wear such a gaudy outfit.
13	33 22 20 17 8 14 24 35 9 2	These two look like such losers in those hats.
14	24 15 20 25 17 22 28 3 29 8	How did you guess my favorite color? Am I being watched?
14	28 16 21 18 1 13 3 23 31 15	What if he gets shocked by the microphone?
14	22 27 34 16 32 5 17 11 23 31	They need to drive faster
14	20 17 1 12 26 25 15 5 34 21	Business is taking over everything! Even Greek temples!!
14	31 11 17 21 30 12 19 7 4 33	I wonder what this man is putting into the pot!
14	21 35 34 11 26 2 18 19 33 13	I would be afraid that this beautiful ceiling would fall in on me.
14	12 21 34 7 23 35 10 17 33 31	Someone is watching from the windows
14	9 7 1 22 4 32 19 34 30 6	There is way to many people here
14	23 25 7 2 8 19 6 21 16 12	I hope this song doesn't get stuck in my brain for a week
14	23 20 21 13 33 19 10 31 28 32	Cities make one think of death and crime.
14	5 11 22 31 34 33 35 8 27 19	I hope those don't get too close to where we're sitting!
14	35 6 28 4 32 21 16 17 8 10	That man is obviously scared that the tractor could hurt someone.
14	31 6 20 27 30 10 22 21 12 2	Someone might trip over that ladder in the middle of the floor.
14	21 9 5 4 33 6 32 20 31 13	Where are their kids parents?
14	15 4 29 11 19 3 10 7 21 35	I would hate to be on this street alone at night.
14	8 24 20 27 31 5 26 29 6 1	Are they getting married? At such an old age? Imagine if the emotion is too intense and one of them dies!
14	28 32 20 3 35 5 6 26 34 30	This strange bush pattern is communicating to me!  It's the aliens!
14	7 22 28 15 13 23 4 26 18 31	up here no one can find me .... not even THEM !

14	18 6 10 13 17 2 11 16 9 5	I bet there are people looking at me from those windows.
14	25 23 31 1 13 34 7 18 2 3	I don't think I like the look of that biker.
14	26 31 9 24 19 21 33 22 13 12	Why does she look worried?
14	19 33 4 18 28 34 3 5 25 22	the highlighted words are the dangerous word.
14	1 16 31 23 28 9 32 4 27 34	Playing ball without a helmet seems dangerous to me.
14	25 6 13 16 28 34 21 15 9 33	Santa looks like he is plotting something.
14	19 12 9 7 5 24 26 8 16 4	Is this a house or a museum or open to the public? Should I go in and find out? Will I be trespassing?
14	19 21 33 23 2 17 7 11 22 28	Can he see me through those glasses? Seriously, it's freaking me out.
14	17 2 34 6 16 23 33 20 32 24	This color is not normal, it might be signal or warning about what will happen next
14	19 33 35 9 32 24 7 16 28 23	Poor color,bad layout seems almost like a coffin.
14	23 26 24 3 15 18 11 17 28 2	I think my computer got a virus from downloading this photo.
14	35 9 28 8 20 6 1 15 27 24	I am scared someone would hack me if I had a phone like that.
14	4 25 34 30 1 17 2 13 29 23	IT FOR MONEY NO HUH VSacrifice
14	9 13 16 1 26 23 12 18 6 11	This makes me nervous, it's blurry and seems like a busy train station.
14	5 1 2 12 4 31 22 3 9 32	THE DRIVE WON BUT WAS SCARED HE WOULD NOT
14	16 6 31 28 24 32 18 10 11 30	I WASN'T PREPARED FOR THE TASK BECAUSE I WAS PARANOID
14	1 29 17 20 31 8 19 24 18 3	Those people in the crowd on the bleachers are listening to someone to tell them to attack me.
14	21 10 34 26 24 17 7 35 22 25	i think my computer got infected from this photo
14	11 34 29 33 10 22 9 25 19 5	how do tall buildings not fall down??
14	9 35 29 3 20 32 23 22 5 16	The people at the house across the lake are probably staring at me right now.
14	11 5 2 20 32 35 28 13 16 15	What is that woman plotting?
14	6 30 27 32 22 25 4 29 35 2	I can't let my bike out of my sight, even in a field.
14	29 11 9 28 25 7 6 27 12 35	I could never stand in front of a curtain where someone could be hiding.
14	1 28 16 11 7 24 13 10 29 18	Can I open my eyes please?  I don't like this!
14	32 22 10 35 33 21 6 16 8 19	you cannot guarantee that you will land safely
14	7 28 35 2 32 24 25 10 34 6	what a meaningless picture. Just two people
14	28 35 17 16 2 24 1 31 11 9	These clouds are hiding the chemtrails.
14	28 9 13 34 4 16 19 27 3 17	What if that guy opens his door to hard and fast and hits mine.
14	31 8 23 35 20 6 15 27 34 9	Immigrants are going to take all of the work.
14	7 3 27 1 35 9 19 10 11 15	Why is there a cop there?
14	19 31 7 9 23 20 25 29 27 5	I'm pretty sure I see chem trails in the sky.
14	17 2 11 21 18 3 32 27 5 25	I feel like everyone is staring at me
14	5 29 1 22 35 7 25 17 9 30	I'd be scared to get tattoos on my head.
14	19 6 3 31 7 20 11 30 10 17	The car might hit the people
14	32 1 12 10 13 15 20 8 5 19	I'm paranoid about what is hidden by the blur.
14	7 2 13 16 20 24 3 11 19 27	MR POTATO HEAD IS NERVOUS ABOUT DYING.
14	22 2 9 17 33 18 35 8 3 4	Why is she covering part of her face?  Maybe she's trying to hide something important from us.  I don't trust them.
14	34 8 23 29 24 12 3 2 27 9	there could be cops around here
14	2 25 17 1 32 11 26 12 24 35	I'm pretty sure I've seen this guy following me around the grocery store before...
14	12 24 1 34 19 26 31 4 28 15	Those bright lights are UFOs that are coming for us
14	35 33 21 15 7 23 4 6 17 31	Hate trains. What if they crash or get hijacked?
14	30 7 22 15 31 6 26 27 20 25	Those rocks look like the might fall down
14	1 25 11 2 15 3 34 22 28 24	This food looks like it could have diseases that might make me sick.
14	28 30 25 5 17 11 7 23 20 33	I bet they are talking about me.
14	34 5 24 22 1 28 18 20 2 7	I hope that this isn't a book of ancient spells!
14	9 19 6 33 28 15 30 34 17 21	Is there someone in that car?
14	26 24 23 17 10 20 19 31 33 9	Yikes, who knows what creeps could be lurking behind that waterfall?
14	21 15 2 22 3 23 30 25 19 11	It might look like a normal scene, but you just know they've got microphones in those light posts listening to everything we say.
14	5 28 20 32 4 25 23 8 24 27	Should these kids really be fishing so close to a ledge?
14	24 13 6 3 34 22 1 15 28 17	Who is shining a spotlight?
14	11 15 35 13 16 34 27 2 32 21	Why do these leaves look purple. They must be poisoned.
14	8 13 26 35 9 3 1 16 30 20	There's something out there! I'm super paranoid right now.
14	7 23 20 29 16 15 24 18 33 12	Be careful or they might try and arrest you!
14	1 3 32 13 26 33 28 34 21 10	I don't trust this image.
14	17 24 6 2 3 26 15 9 25 8	Want to see what is in his mouth
14	21 33 10 5 2 13 26 7 4 16	I have no idea what these letters say, almost like in the dark ages when no one could read, who knows what it could mean.
14	6 17 23 21 13 24 29 27 28 15	lord those candles might fall!
14	6 30 1 10 19 5 12 31 15 34	What is in the dark spaces?
14	12 26 5 33 22 8 32 1 9 17	Is that a dog or a goat about to attack me?
14	23 29 22 18 3 33 31 6 30 32	I feel like these birds have been following me.
14	7 2 11 19 26 9 32 28 16 30	That bird is hoping a hawk doesn't come by.
14	24 27 35 23 1 13 21 17 5 7	I'm nervous about what he's going to say. He might say something about me.
14	32 16 13 20 15 3 29 25 31 35	I feel like they are coming after me
14	10 16 4 27 6 28 11 17 30 5	uh oh..looks like the end
14	7 6 23 8 35 12 18 2 21 5	Looks like a storm is coming!
14	35 31 29 30 28 22 34 19 33 2	It looks to be watching me, makes me uncomfortable.
14	18 23 31 25 34 3 28 10 4 1	I feel like someone is watching me in this room
14	22 4 29 18 21 32 3 33 15 16	what does all this mean? It's a conspiracy!
14	3 27 7 23 26 13 16 9 35 18	That guy is staring at the camera man like he wants to stab him...
14	35 31 30 17 20 26 4 27 8 28	theres a bug on the floor
14	7 9 21 34 31 22 28 19 17 25	I would be wondering if my boyfriend really wanted to marry me, that's the look she got on her face.
14	30 25 17 35 3 8 6 7 15 29	I hope there's nothing waiting under that tablecloth ready to jump out.
14	4 30 9 23 20 11 5 13 32 8	How is the family in the back so tall?? Someone doctored this photo, there is no way they are that tall.
14	16 1 35 33 4 26 24 34 18 28	I feel ill at ease seeing this weapon of war even if it is old.
14	19 10 31 22 13 6 4 25 1 16	I bet there are people hiding around here on that cliff.
14	35 5 22 15 20 27 12 13 3 6	Wow this picture is dark!  I hope there isn't a rat in that pot to jump out at me!
14	31 32 8 27 33 21 25 9 26 35	It reminds me of the secret garden - that used to freak me out when i was a kid... Like, what if there is some whole other world hiding in your garden, it's not like you can see through those bushes - there could be someone there just watching you right now and you wouldn't even know...
14	16 25 2 33 30 5 17 26 19 13	I feel uncomfortable in spaces like this
14	22 18 13 20 5 15 3 6 17 10	Those guys are trespassing, I know it!
14	7 23 16 8 12 27 18 26 32 19	I'm leery of this notebook and they collect could personal info I store in it, even it I delete it. Way too risky for me.
14	21 18 9 5 35 7 17 15 29 34	hope there are no sharks in that water
14	4 34 35 6 10 1 33 27 5 28	great for flowers but id wear googles around that thing
14	33 32 29 18 9 30 24 31 16 28	All of that water, I do not want to risk drowning in it
14	32 35 2 21 30 6 31 5 25 9	THIS MAN IN FRONT OF ME KEEPS FOLLOWING ME AND STARING AT ME
14	10 26 1 8 22 25 12 4 35 33	Hope he had her sign a prenuptial agreement.
14	11 25 5 17 6 4 10 7 30 28	I bet the person who took this picture is going to be her stalker someday.
14	11 29 22 35 24 19 15 28 6 23	This stage is set so much higher than the audience, isn't anyone else concerned about if the stage collapses? Are the band members trying to see down my shirt or something? This just makes me feel uncomfortable!
14	8 24 12 13 29 21 15 27 33 17	I'm scared I don't know the way.
14	7 19 32 6 21 25 12 23 4 1	I hate being this high up, I always feel like we're going to crash!
14	26 15 32 27 16 19 2 28 21 34	Looks like one of those surveillance drones theyre trying to watch us with
14	12 7 23 9 15 5 13 31 16 18	On the bottom left, you have to wonder if all these ships are in the same area for the same reason, maybe some meeting off the coast where they can't be observed?
14	23 31 35 33 28 8 2 34 3 10	I dont want to go inside this creapy church.
14	35 16 2 20 13 5 12 8 10 29	If I stand on this field any longer, I may have a softball hit me on the head.
14	8 2 15 5 29 17 31 4 18 19	Really  hope that doesn't sting me
14	30 4 21 26 6 25 7 15 31 5	What is out there in the dark that scared all those birds?  I hope it isn't coming after me.
14	8 30 33 21 5 23 25 12 11 16	I bet that lady is spreading germs and has the flu.
14	15 18 5 27 21 23 8 33 29 35	snow of full is bike My
14	28 21 11 35 10 2 25 15 18 13	Why are they staring at me?
14	3 29 21 18 28 5 1 33 32 20	I am sure this guy will ask me to stand and say something.
14	35 31 16 30 9 4 19 1 26 2	everyone was aware of their surroundings.
14	4 20 30 17 6 16 22 31 11 10	I love how the flame glows in this picture it reminds me of my chimney that I light up everyday.
14	13 19 30 1 28 4 31 35 2 18	I hope it doesn't rain.
14	25 15 6 17 9 29 21 1 11 2	I bet there is a monster in the water.
14	16 35 1 4 8 10 7 29 33 31	I don't have a good feeling about where that kid is heading in the neighborhood...
14	17 15 22 12 34 30 11 9 21 25	I bet that thing is dangerous.
14	8 16 19 6 3 25 2 12 32 5	there's more people than necessary for that many kites
14	12 4 29 11 32 8 19 31 25 23	only bad things happen on cloudy days like this one
14	12 33 20 32 8 21 1 19 6 25	WHEN I JUMPED FROM THIS CLIFF INTO THE SEA, I WAS VERY SCARED.
14	13 9 11 34 7 19 20 15 33 12	What if I get lost in the snow?
14	27 1 22 20 7 8 35 25 12 34	See this is proof the government spys on elevator conversations.
14	7 19 8 3 24 4 11 33 10 18	I hope that kid doesn't run into those sticks!
14	27 20 33 7 18 6 2 22 30 26	I bet someone is under that train cutting the breaks
14	1 25 10 33 29 31 23 26 6 19	I've been meaning to start a bottle collection but I'm worried people will think I'm an alcoholic
14	11 15 1 17 35 8 12 19 18 6	These are all over the ocean! Gross!
14	8 1 21 7 31 24 11 5 6 35	Geez, that place is creepy. It's like the trees are stalking you.
14	8 4 15 10 3 2 24 28 34 17	Why are they looking at me?
14	13 2 4 20 1 5 15 28 31 8	I feel like they're looking right at me
14	17 16 34 11 5 30 31 19 29 8	We shouldn't be using so many candles, the house may catch fire.
14	6 27 4 13 18 16 2 5 17 19	I hope a real bull doesn't come along and hurt that little boy.
14	29 11 24 31 20 13 5 17 27 4	CAN I HAVE A SECOND CHANCE
14	17 32 35 26 5 25 1 19 12 2	what if a whale eats me?!
14	11 18 30 15 22 17 12 8 27 9	when there's so many people, I don't go outside like this
14	10 25 1 11 27 35 7 5 19 17	Hopefully that handle on the clock doesn't fall off!
14	13 19 9 4 22 25 7 28 33 26	i am alaways suspicios of things like this
14	18 3 17 1 35 13 34 22 9 30	I wonder what he is in my house for, seems odd
14	13 34 35 20 8 17 23 6 18 16	Looks like a very scary store to go into alone.
14	22 19 12 4 32 18 29 33 27 26	I would love to jump in, but there may be sharks.
14	20 18 25 15 17 10 8 11 1 34	I'm scared the whole thing is going to collapse
14	9 13 27 5 28 22 24 6 17 30	I would be so worried about getting struck by lightning bathing out in a field like that.
14	28 15 9 5 8 33 20 23 22 31	Who's looking out from that window?
14	23 24 35 6 19 13 21 32 33 22	suspicioussuspisci are They .that like they are Why
14	22 10 5 23 31 8 1 24 33 34	I won't every go at that late at night. Downtown areas are way too sketchy for me.
14	32 24 30 20 17 18 23 25 11 21	I'm not entirely sure what I'm seeing, but it's seriously creeping me out.
14	30 18 10 21 17 1 15 26 11 20	All these people are after someone...be careful.
14	7 21 3 26 32 1 29 15 24 6	I do not know what this device is used for and I do not want to know. Could be something sinister!
14	27 20 15 3 9 26 19 31 33 34	I would hate to live in a big city like this one, I would always feel like someone was watching me, so they could attack me.
14	27 16 7 9 22 32 12 26 15 25	Why is she floating like that?!
14	8 15 1 21 24 34 9 26 31 33	I will not come near such a place because I might get swept in by a huge wave.
14	13 8 19 4 21 25 18 10 11 6	The aliens would love it here
14	28 29 15 26 35 34 2 6 1 27	Why are they walking so close to the edge? Aren't they paying attention?
14	9 6 29 21 34 5 28 19 12 31	DON'T BE PARANOID, YOU WILL DIE
14	15 10 5 23 26 24 29 32 31 17	Im afraid of that color
14	6 20 24 2 12 7 34 15 3 25	I really hope I don't fall over the gate. The second floor is pretty high.
14	2 17 22 32 15 6 1 29 13 28	Did you post personal information on this ticket?
14	20 27 18 25 31 35 23 3 11 4	I feel like I've seen this guy before. I'm positive he was following me a few weeks back.
14	26 12 8 2 21 15 1 23 4 35	What if the donkey kicks its hind legs? Won't the man steering the donkey be hurt, or even killed?
14	30 26 6 21 28 27 34 9 19 32	is this supposed to mean something???
14	33 7 26 6 34 24 3 4 15 12	Oh god, I bet that arch is going to fall on someone someday.
14	27 31 35 21 19 13 18 29 11 23	That man is nothing but a danger to our lives!
14	13 32 33 25 27 7 31 28 22 2	I'm not comfortable with how far apart they are from each other.
14	8 13 30 2 29 35 6 26 4 25	The crime rate worries me. What if I'm mugged? What if I'm attacked? What if I get lost?
14	6 10 17 4 33 32 3 25 21 26	Oh dear that looks like eyes looking at me and scares me!
14	18 26 35 31 4 16 25 29 21 33	Hmmm... looks like a spy car to me... they're watching.
14	27 30 25 18 29 11 26 35 17 19	That plant is probably poisonous
14	30 8 11 12 7 34 35 32 22 3	is that guy looking at the camera person?
14	15 8 17 27 5 9 31 3 22 23	I truly fear something will pop out from the impending darkness and shock the couple watching the sunset.
14	32 29 5 20 12 24 6 15 17 25	The sparkly fireworks made everyone scared.
14	15 29 19 34 10 23 22 11 9 20	I hope shes not using anything toxic!
14	28 27 31 1 24 7 35 9 20 29	Those amplifiers will steal your social security number of you stand too close to them.
14	4 29 24 28 11 34 25 1 21 16	I think this man just made eye-contact with me. I hope he isn't a terrorist.
14	20 26 8 9 1 7 32 24 31 34	What if that mountain explodes? it happened in hawaii, it could happen there. BOOM. suddenly lava everywhere.
14	13 12 26 19 27 20 29 22 3 8	Oh my god. He is going to steal that car.
14	24 29 6 19 12 27 17 28 22 26	What if I get everything wrong?
14	29 24 26 10 11 3 21 4 9 31	ive seen that man before
14	29 17 18 21 32 12 5 30 10 16	It looks unsafe in the area
14	6 18 23 1 34 30 4 17 29 31	This guy looks like his music is not his passion.  He's playing the drums, but not to entertain people.
14	32 13 21 18 34 19 15 24 33 12	She made it too hot for them to stand next to her
14	30 3 29 2 34 9 32 17 18 16	That elephant is going to go rogue
14	22 13 1 31 24 3 26 30 25 11	Is that Sue? That looks like Sue. She wants to steal my boyfriend.
14	32 12 9 18 8 13 27 5 23 28	Oh no! I he misses the ball everyone is going to think that he's stupid.
14	28 8 2 21 31 20 30 10 16 5	That lumber looks like it's going to fall any minute.
14	34 18 20 35 24 1 19 11 16 17	Do you see the goatman on the rock formation on the left side of the picture that looks like a portal to another dimension?! The goatman watches, the goatman watches!
14	24 28 21 29 4 3 32 8 25 2	I wonder if that's poisonous to the touch.
14	12 8 15 29 20 9 11 10 26 17	The flower could be deadly
14	34 11 12 28 29 33 20 25 10 3	This looks like it might fall in at anytime.
14	2 19 5 6 8 31 34 10 32 30	I wouldn't wear that shirt if I were him.
14	24 4 8 5 32 31 15 3 26 23	A clown in darkness, nothing good comes out of this
14	1 24 22 17 10 21 30 12 29 25	I swear I was at that exact shop last week and bought a soda from that refrigerator!
14	34 27 7 29 35 19 24 17 18 33	this looks like a very sketchy place..
14	4 32 27 24 10 7 22 26 34 9	I'm worried that he's being followed.
14	8 27 32 29 30 25 5 22 3 26	Whats that on his head?  Why is it there?
14	13 15 8 22 18 17 34 27 31 1	I went past it the other day , I swear I heard a support beam crack , I know its going to collapse any day and I will be walking by .
14	8 11 29 17 26 19 18 9 24 15	There's a ghost lurking in that dark archway.
14	19 32 26 24 16 21 22 1 27 20	Don't let fear rule you
14	21 31 32 30 1 3 18 16 29 7	Empty streets like this always leave m suspicious that someone is in the woods.
14	21 19 3 20 17 4 28 1 25 22	why is he looking at me like that
14	7 4 28 33 16 19 20 10 21 34	What are they over there doing??
14	32 26 16 15 24 13 34 9 31 25	Those poles are probably out there so the government can keep tabs on us.
14	13 12 16 27 1 15 34 21 26 30	That plane does not look safe.  Couldn't pay me enough to get on that thing. Yikes!
14	1 19 6 4 18 33 30 34 17 21	Ahh I hope that sign doesn't fall in a storm :(
14	6 22 15 16 35 2 30 18 28 31	I wonder if these masks hide dangerous criminals.
14	11 34 4 10 16 15 35 28 2 18	There could be ninjas hiding above those turnstiles.
14	13 23 3 9 21 16 7 31 1 25	Seems like a get together
14	6 8 11 15 31 32 33 34 23 9	I would be so nervous someone would come up behind me and push me off this cliff!
14	22 11 30 26 17 29 20 4 13 5	How deep is that puddle? Would I fall in if I stepped on that leaf?
14	5 24 13 32 18 22 33 28 1 12	God I would hate being there, imagine all the creepy crawlers on you.
14	13 12 11 9 29 20 33 22 3 10	Churches fill me with fear.
14	16 23 24 7 35 26 19 10 4 3	They must be up to no good.
14	23 26 28 32 18 25 19 29 33 17	You never know what is hidden beneath a pretty color.
14	7 27 16 35 32 10 19 17 2 26	You wouldn't find me in that box hanging by a little rope.
14	12 10 26 4 31 9 22 25 13 32	Did you guys pay to get in?  Would I need to?
14	30 31 21 19 20 13 22 9 12 26	All the people in that crowd are out to get me!
14	5 27 16 1 28 32 19 17 31 12	These vegetables might have radiation in them.
14	8 31 32 18 11 35 3 33 6 12	These white flowers look poisonous, best not get too close.
14	6 1 3 15 25 10 7 24 21 30	That fish is the reason I don't swim.
14	25 30 27 16 9 31 15 17 6 12	Seeing him upside down makes me question my own reality.
14	18 12 8 31 2 27 23 33 32 7	Why is he on the floor? He seems like he's on drugs. Doesn't he seem like he's been doing drugs???
14	13 27 18 22 20 12 9 16 34 17	i heard things explode over there
14	6 2 20 28 21 22 29 33 35 15	He is probably putting up security installations on the door in case of intruders.
14	1 17 26 19 8 4 21 23 3 13	Why does this look like a horror movie still?
14	26 18 8 29 7 25 16 35 21 28	What if the bus explodes?
14	5 20 9 30 31 22 13 18 21 27	Shes gonna fall, shes gonna fall
14	17 3 12 24 35 26 18 28 8 34	They're going to break something. These never go well.
14	12 25 19 22 32 11 15 6 21 34	THIS GUY WILL FALL RATHER QUICKLY
14	31 16 34 32 19 3 17 4 8 27	No way I'm walking down that creepy corridor
14	25 8 32 33 11 28 17 12 20 13	Why is he not looking at the field? He's gonna miss a shot and make them lose the game.
14	35 8 11 29 3 2 20 10 15 4	That man is definitely going to get electrocuted!
14	28 27 25 8 1 26 20 19 31 22	I think their might be dangerous alligators in that lake.
14	13 24 32 3 15 10 27 11 16 9	I hear too many voices
14	31 18 16 30 29 25 28 21 32 22	Look at all those bodies piling up at the bottom!
14	18 35 10 6 9 16 2 27 31 20	They are trying to keep me away
14	26 35 23 21 13 10 27 32 17 24	I wonder where this is at
14	8 2 19 11 17 25 27 30 3 24	Do not touch the dial
14	12 21 29 25 28 34 13 6 20 3	There is something unnatural about this face.
14	26 3 35 28 10 17 4 30 1 23	All the mice are after me
14	20 17 15 7 3 5 24 11 25 19	No thank you! I'd freak out.
14	19 28 30 1 18 4 7 23 3 31	This is an act of terroism.
14	35 6 15 13 10 1 23 25 17 9	Does anyone else see something move between the trees? Anyone?
14	12 10 34 28 32 22 11 21 29 19	What's hiding in that dresser???
14	30 25 5 27 16 31 34 20 33 24	There's something off about the crookedness of this picture, you have to wonder if something wrong was happening and why the subject was smiling.
14	6 5 4 15 19 33 8 25 22 13	That's a lot of cars that could veer off the road.
14	16 15 10 32 13 21 28 7 31 11	If I were to pass away, will I ever have a funeral as nice as this?
14	30 20 9 8 33 11 6 26 34 4	Will that dog bite me?
14	10 3 26 28 13 12 6 7 29 4	What are they doing in that house?
14	20 23 2 25 6 31 8 13 26 1	Why is that guy running on the blue team? Is he trying to screw the game up?
14	8 22 34 5 18 3 30 16 32 9	The sky looks kind of ominous. What if lightning strikes? Those people need to be inside!
14	28 2 13 6 23 5 27 15 24 26	I wonder if he is taking a picture of someone without their knowledge?
14	4 15 21 24 16 27 6 12 19 3	That's too much glass for others to see through.
14	13 22 32 25 21 30 6 18 33 35	You can't see the person on the right's reflection in the mirror, I wonder why this was photoshopped?
14	6 24 15 8 5 29 32 16 7 27	Why is he staring at me.  Is there something on my face?
14	1 17 16 10 4 18 22 11 13 30	This man looks like he's turning to search for what is haunting him.
14	32 31 24 25 11 16 17 7 23 28	looks kinda like a murderer
14	25 27 24 2 19 21 18 30 12 34	Wonder who is lurking in the shadows?
14	4 1 32 17 35 19 2 23 25 12	What would happen if the bricks began to fall?
14	22 27 17 21 10 12 6 29 20 25	What are they up to? The look suspicious
14	29 7 20 31 34 5 2 12 30 23	I am afraid of big mirrors like this shattering, and giving me bad luck eternally.
14	7 31 19 29 8 28 30 27 21 16	I hope this plane landed safely.
14	35 33 29 26 27 30 12 18 3 2	What a strange old woman, I wonder what she's doing there.
14	28 32 2 1 3 23 34 8 20 17	What are they looking at? They are plotting something
14	13 21 29 32 9 20 22 23 18 12	These people should be very careful they don't wreck the boat.
14	19 20 13 17 32 4 35 11 1 30	What is this train transporting? What could the government possibly need trains for?
14	34 18 10 16 23 21 20 32 15 12	What is behind that horrid face, it looks like someone is hiding somewhere waiting to hurt someone.
14	27 17 3 1 22 24 16 20 18 4	Never trust a guy in a suit.  Three guys in suits is a personal problem.
14	22 9 24 5 31 6 33 15 20 3	Dude, there is totally a ghost or in this pic!!!
14	24 6 33 7 35 30 5 27 21 8	Why do I feel like this plane is watching me
14	8 33 7 9 29 22 34 18 23 32	This old man's face looks devious and he's clearly in the government, you really can't trust any of them.
14	1 15 32 9 20 19 16 12 31 24	who prepared the food, I don't know them
14	22 31 3 27 9 16 18 30 29 4	are the childrens parents near by? they shouldn't be wondering around by themselves.
14	20 4 5 21 6 32 19 29 13 35	these look like they would hurt to step on
14	1 4 6 2 22 19 31 18 25 10	Don't look now but I think he is about to get hit.
14	3 16 30 11 10 13 23 31 9 17	Why is that man in the water just laying there? What is he hiding?
14	16 23 10 7 34 1 18 8 11 29	I don't know about you but this looks like some peephole with someone looking at me.
14	27 31 10 25 5 17 26 28 13 24	THIS IS SUCH A SCARY PLACE TO BE AT NIGHT.
14	4 33 6 35 15 19 1 16 23 26	This brings back memories of Charlottesville.
14	24 18 34 9 32 2 19 12 5 25	I can't get over being afraid.
14	8 10 35 25 20 33 2 15 18 32	They say the air is hard to breathe up there but I think that's just to discourage us from getting closer to the sky.
14	7 6 15 2 13 17 27 20 4 18	That bear should be caged.
14	20 6 19 28 15 22 23 21 13 1	I do not know what is happening in this picture and it's freaking me out.
14	23 28 29 15 1 11 7 2 35 9	me at looking they Are
14	28 5 10 29 33 34 16 27 12 31	I KNOW SHE IS NERVOUS ABOUT THE WEDDING.
14	18 3 10 6 11 30 25 33 21 5	watch out for those mirrors
14	22 31 11 5 4 34 10 12 6 18	Oh my goodness! What are they doing to that grave? They should leave the dead alone.
14	34 9 20 32 23 16 17 7 12 35	Why can't I see anything? Is this supposed to be a subliminal message? What is it going to do to me?
14	33 15 13 19 16 7 6 30 22 4	there worm holes on this.
14	19 34 2 29 20 12 27 35 33 13	Better fill up now before WWIII starts and gas is too expensive!!
14	25 18 24 20 9 5 6 33 21 23	That color makes me feel like I'm being watched.
14	24 5 4 1 13 23 18 26 12 33	I bet she is going to run away with all the groom's money and the best man.
14	9 35 25 21 8 22 5 2 11 6	That dog is secretly a robot sent to spy on his owner.
14	19 6 17 4 28 35 30 20 8 22	Being here is a good way to get ran over!
14	22 29 17 33 18 35 4 25 5 27	I really don't like all those blue lights.
14	23 34 24 13 26 33 22 17 15 6	What are we digging for!
14	8 13 18 20 12 15 21 23 5 24	Why is it so dark
14	17 22 10 4 9 31 18 26 20 24	I could never raft for reasons like this, these currents would drag me down and drown me in a heartbeat, I just know it.
14	22 16 24 30 33 26 28 23 29 31	There's a secret camera behind one of those dots and it is sending messages to the government.
14	17 29 16 31 27 1 10 7 4 13	I really hope they don't get hurt playing the game.
14	26 19 32 28 35 2 8 5 11 25	Don't fall off the wall.
14	29 1 23 18 27 4 13 26 35 16	I really need a fortress like this in order to prepare me. The end of times is coming guys! These will be the only people that survive.
14	15 25 21 13 12 18 31 1 17 3	what are these people plotting?
14	31 19 8 24 15 11 26 6 20 3	ahh this reminds me of highschool and I do not want to go back to that time
14	16 28 6 21 1 4 35 20 30 12	All that glass in one place? Seems like it could be easily broken.
14	23 32 34 12 16 4 30 27 24 22	I think that person in the black coat is following the person in the tan trench coat.
14	6 15 19 2 12 20 18 10 24 1	I SURE HOPE THE BEES DON'T STING US.
14	7 18 5 27 32 33 28 11 8 22	Someone is going to push her.
14	5 3 15 29 11 27 8 17 24 23	Where has all the color gone?
14	21 11 4 30 28 24 34 15 17 8	What is he doing on that boat? Has he been sent to spy on my house?
14	23 25 1 34 17 5 30 29 32 16	uhh ohhh is something outside?
14	20 30 25 23 7 13 2 19 10 18	What is this even doing here?
14	5 9 11 26 17 22 15 29 24 7	That rabbit is looking directly at me.
14	9 16 12 2 26 8 11 3 22 1	I sure this owl is looking at me!
14	9 18 22 35 27 7 12 2 4 5	I could never walk down the streets of this city
14	26 31 23 15 9 16 28 13 17 3	i would hate to be the plane in the middle
14	29 30 1 34 32 20 5 22 6 16	I don't knowhow to swim and what if there are sharks
14	31 9 7 4 12 1 34 21 23 20	I keep seeing lemon-like shapes. It's like they follow me.
14	21 22 9 25 10 3 5 6 29 12	The vehicle is the move.
14	30 4 33 3 18 35 10 21 5 22	Oh no, a helicopter? That can't mean anything good...
14	23 2 3 21 4 34 25 22 15 7	I don't think this is very good
14	35 30 4 21 31 3 17 24 34 29	With this people around, there is definitely a virus on the streets.
14	10 22 4 29 20 24 23 28 30 18	The cartoon looks a bit insecure
14	23 4 9 7 30 27 16 31 8 29	Is that a reflection in the tea kettle?  Is someone standing in front of it?  Who's really there?
14	19 18 15 2 10 1 20 11 23 13	Why is he running towards me?
14	26 25 10 17 9 15 22 29 23 7	The ducks are swimming so far away from land, what will they do if it starts raining?
14	35 22 29 18 25 8 15 34 3 33	I cant help but think how this art would easily be destroyed with a big earthquake or some natural disaster!
14	23 3 10 34 2 35 16 29 9 19	Is this about me?  Please tell me this isn't talking about me.
14	11 28 31 4 7 3 8 5 27 9	?cars cops undercover Those Are0
14	2 23 1 9 24 7 33 3 26 20	This place is really dark. I don't think I'd want to be in there alone.
14	27 18 10 11 8 1 5 33 2 26	That canopy is going to blow away any second! They need to wight it down quickly!
14	24 17 6 21 30 11 10 8 2 7	I can't think of why he would want to wear this.
14	8 28 32 24 15 9 4 34 10 3	I really hope he lands properly, the wheels don't look aligned properly.
14	29 17 16 32 22 19 15 21 23 9	I really hope we don't freeze in here.
14	34 15 2 32 29 27 16 21 24 6	i hope the waves don't crash into them
14	10 8 6 27 25 7 1 2 34 21	THE COLOR GREEN IS JEALOUSY AND MAKES ME HAVE A PARANOIA.
14	4 12 5 6 23 15 24 11 22 35	I feel like Pennywise could jump out at me any moment
14	9 29 4 10 7 17 33 6 1 13	I really hope you guys are okay
14	25 21 24 11 18 4 13 19 12 3	Hopefully the only woman not wearing a hat isn't going to be reprimanded!
14	3 4 10 15 33 8 5 1 18 20	I think she is a monster
14	12 33 32 34 21 19 2 20 10 8	And he wondered if it would be safe to leave the confines of this room.
14	11 6 3 23 7 24 34 33 20 13	the cracks in the building make one nervous.
14	33 3 28 19 16 21 30 12 25 13	Jeez, those singers look quite creepy.
14	17 15 33 7 9 5 29 23 26 35	I wonder why that man in the middle looks so suspicious
14	9 18 30 10 7 26 33 31 8 25	I wouldn't want to get close to this thing, it might eat my brain.
14	20 9 29 12 16 34 15 35 5 24	I sometimes feel very uncomfortable in open markets
14	20 35 7 17 4 6 32 19 16 11	Are there cameras in my gym?
14	13 29 10 15 6 7 19 31 1 34	That cat staring like that freaks me out.
14	7 2 27 10 21 11 19 29 33 22	I couldn't imagine being in a city like this, I wouldn't feel safe.
14	22 20 27 33 26 4 30 1 11 24	Everyone will see me if I sit there.
14	34 32 17 15 3 4 2 20 13 18	Creepy looking place!  I don't go to places like this. No way.
14	32 19 29 18 15 9 7 23 2 8	It's a highly red color, pink in hue, one might call light futia. It's awful, something from Brave New World. I can see this on political banners, especially from a President who wants to control my life.
14	3 21 10 25 32 34 35 18 15 24	I don't see anything German on this table, just Russian.
14	32 21 27 28 3 5 13 16 20 7	I bet that shelter would fall at a slight wind.
14	25 1 8 26 13 11 30 22 23 2	That bird is out to get me
14	13 34 5 9 1 26 10 32 28 21	Would people watch you as you took this photo?
14	24 29 1 22 18 11 35 23 26 7	The bandits are going to appear at the top of that ridge and shoot us all!
14	25 34 16 29 10 2 26 15 17 8	Do you think they saw me reading their signs? I think they saw me. I think they think I'm against them!
14	10 18 5 2 29 13 6 30 7 21	I'd be scared to see her in a back alley.
14	33 3 8 20 22 23 12 5 15 32	If that child is not careful they will trip and probably kill that puppy!
14	28 4 23 19 27 9 33 13 34 12	Wow, birds can be a bad omen.  I would take this pic down.
14	31 15 16 9 3 30 23 17 29 24	I hope there is nothing strange hidden beneath those leaves
14	26 33 15 20 28 13 11 35 30 21	Is this guy following me?!
14	3 24 2 15 32 19 30 16 20 12	This is a nice pic, a little weird, but nice.
14	3 4 22 18 31 2 7 23 30 5	Omg...I hate pics like this.  What if this is his last pic alive?  Racing is crazy dangerous!!
14	26 15 22 24 13 21 27 10 16 29	This tree is so close to falling over
14	27 35 7 9 21 13 26 22 4 12	Umm....that looks like a garbage bag with a head hanging out of it!   PEACE OUT!
14	11 7 16 25 12 29 35 33 6 26	I like the trees, the looks so healthy although some appear to be dry, I like trees with green leaves.
14	16 7 18 34 3 22 35 6 12 19	I think he may steel stuff.
14	4 10 31 2 19 29 11 7 34 22	When I walked into the room everyone looked at me and left
14	8 2 11 4 20 22 5 13 31 29	I don't want to go up the stairs I know I will fall
14	3 35 17 6 11 24 7 8 22 21	I think she might fall.
14	24 19 28 8 4 11 1 15 22 3	Oh my god, what is she doing?
14	15 19 13 27 6 11 24 32 9 4	I don't know if I'll like this game.
14	32 17 19 4 31 30 27 34 10 13	I think this kid is plotting my revenge.
14	22 35 28 23 33 17 27 25 31 30	VERY OLDEST AND PRECIOUS PLACE
14	32 8 16 20 26 33 28 29 30 31	I would be afraid of whats in there
14	31 5 2 9 32 18 35 8 6 3	Does he have safety harnesses in case he falls?
14	28 25 21 12 6 19 13 16 4 17	It really bothers me that he is putting those dirty fingers in his mouth
14	28 27 19 32 4 31 2 22 13 5	There could be so many bees hidden in those flowers.
14	31 15 35 19 27 4 30 28 18 8	I don't know what these kids are looking at but it's bugging me out
14	34 5 9 1 16 2 6 10 3 8	I bet someone is under there... waiting...
14	26 4 8 15 27 19 25 32 31 22	There are so many oil tanks on that train that the chances of one catching fire and blowing up seem very likely!
14	11 4 22 27 17 15 30 8 29 32	Looking down, as if something is about to jump out at me.
14	34 30 15 28 35 6 19 11 18 3	creepy puppets come to life
14	22 18 6 1 21 27 32 30 3 9	Should I buy? What am I buying? Who wrote this? If he watching me as I read this?
14	32 35 30 25 12 21 28 3 11 19	They just set me up to fail this one, they hate me.
14	18 31 27 13 5 16 22 28 8 21	I would be afraid a bee will sting me.
14	17 33 24 3 18 11 12 23 1 16	I'm afraid that I'll hit the pitcher in the face.
14	12 25 20 33 17 13 35 8 2 3	I hope she's not dangerous.
14	17 13 6 21 7 1 10 8 15 33	I hope that fox doesn't eat her!
14	33 24 22 25 12 7 6 30 5 20	What is this ominous, foreign sign doing here?!
14	28 1 22 20 17 7 3 15 34 31	Not for the ones with fear of heights
14	32 12 4 5 35 6 19 31 21 3	Can you see someone in those windows? He looks up to no good.
14	23 1 5 13 3 35 21 12 34 19	I HOPE THESE STRIPES DONT FALL ON ME, OR WHAT IF THE FENCE FALLS ON ME,?
14	13 35 34 18 12 28 31 4 24 21	Blonde people are way too curious man...they're way to into what's going on with you...
14	1 24 13 16 17 27 7 31 32 22	It's scary to gather in groups these days.
14	35 26 23 34 31 19 22 10 28 24	She is going to drown
14	4 34 26 12 13 8 10 23 24 21	Does that look like something's buried there? I think it looks like something's buried there!
14	26 25 33 2 27 29 35 21 34 22	I wish I could dance like her, but I feel everyone judging me for it.
14	12 23 33 29 11 15 6 19 16 35	I hope they don't choke on their food.
14	28 6 12 13 24 9 10 29 16 17	I hope the baby doesn't drop that!
14	25 29 18 28 24 2 8 32 21 34	This guy looks like he doesn't trust those kids!
14	28 30 27 31 23 25 11 29 15 26	You don't know where the guy taking this pic is standing, he could be in danger.
14	35 32 7 33 19 6 16 30 15 34	When i was on this train i felt like everyone was staring at me, i got off before my stop and got a taxi home.
14	7 34 35 33 32 11 31 27 12 5	If this is the new trend, I'll be stuck inside all summer. Am I missing out?
14	30 1 22 6 35 33 15 4 3 26	It would be easy to mistake that for a real dog
14	17 24 2 21 27 33 31 20 6 29	I think the petals are giving off toxic substances into the air that are trying to take over my brainwaves.
14	4 15 22 23 31 10 7 27 12 20	I hope this person isn't standing in the road to take the picture. That's so dangerous.
14	8 3 27 34 17 25 12 35 6 9	Be careful not to scratch that beautiful record.
14	22 4 34 30 28 20 16 35 1 21	Im never ever going camping
14	5 8 3 16 25 29 26 4 30 24	That guy with his hands in his pockets looks suspicious.
14	22 20 7 29 10 27 5 13 3 11	I thinik that light might fall!
14	19 26 15 12 8 22 33 24 5 17	Oh gosh, i bet a robber knocked those down!
14	23 34 33 1 28 35 16 12 7 15	Whose arm is that? is that a ghost?
14	7 26 3 30 8 24 13 5 33 12	Is this going to hurt me?
14	12 24 33 4 22 34 8 23 21 28	This light looks ready to burst into flames.
14	12 16 34 35 33 23 25 3 8 4	This color makes me think somebody is camouflaged and watching me.
14	18 19 3 29 33 30 32 4 2 20	I bet they're plotting something
14	8 23 3 33 1 6 24 5 4 9	Why is she walking like that? Are they making her stand like that for their amusement. Why aren't they doing something to help her?
14	20 31 12 28 7 1 6 13 2 30	There is very little food
14	12 9 21 28 15 11 19 4 26 17	The streets being so empty leads me to believe there is something lurking behind the corner.
14	28 34 7 15 9 32 5 1 33 25	I've seen videos where hills like that start to slide onto the road.
14	22 23 24 15 7 19 18 2 33 4	What if somebody saw you doing that, i am pretty sure that's illegal.
14	27 5 24 13 25 10 21 20 8 28	I hope there is no paint damage from the snow!
14	30 6 3 11 2 20 32 26 5 13	I'd be so scared of someone stealing my bike!
14	17 24 12 30 10 4 11 5 22 31	I know this guy. He followed me home from Starbucks last night. He kept hiding in the shadows, but I know it was him.
14	3 8 26 25 23 29 7 13 11 31	These are all seemingly poisonous.
14	3 17 10 1 2 11 15 8 33 31	I can't stand lizard..they look too scaly!
14	3 17 31 8 33 24 30 27 20 28	Something about him makes me uncomfortable.
14	13 31 35 7 29 6 23 11 22 15	I wonder how long that car has been sitting there.
14	9 16 24 21 1 6 4 15 35 11	I would hate to dance in front of everyone.
14	11 6 24 13 26 29 34 28 9 20	Why can't we see this guys face? does he have something to hide?
14	32 9 33 10 16 15 34 1 23 21	I hope thats her husband!
14	2 6 10 26 12 8 31 16 5 25	this is a wonderful classroom
14	1 20 8 16 5 15 11 12 24 22	You could fall down those uneven steps and break your neck so easily.
14	10 27 21 1 16 26 3 15 32 24	ok now i might need someone to show me around....where is this  please...??
14	20 28 6 22 27 32 34 17 12 3	why is he looking at me?
14	16 23 33 1 17 5 15 20 27 3	I would be so scared to fall off the top of this roof setting up a camera
14	12 26 25 22 1 8 21 5 17 20	What is this even a picture of , What is with the skull? it looks terrifying
14	21 7 25 19 4 32 2 10 12 29	I'm going to get shot.
14	28 19 16 12 2 17 3 26 9 33	I could never live that high up in a skyscraper.
14	2 15 23 4 18 25 22 8 11 9	AREA WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE FREAKING ME OUT
14	8 27 13 11 25 35 30 15 7 4	I hope he doesn't get  in an accident.
14	5 28 24 7 15 29 16 21 22 23	Is it just me or does this look like photoshop?
14	19 23 26 18 28 34 16 32 22 3	I hope that isn't going to fall and break.
14	28 19 24 31 35 8 17 32 5 9	Whatever it is he selling I'm not buying.
14	22 5 34 25 9 7 4 17 28 16	Going to miss this shot I just know it
14	20 5 34 12 35 19 21 18 1 28	why are there all these lights? It must make them see us better.
14	35 30 33 3 23 1 9 12 2 18	It's gonna hit the sun!
14	22 20 21 8 9 7 16 1 2 34	Someone's always watching. What's behind the mountain???
14	11 35 8 23 19 7 22 33 16 12	I agree! I hate changing things up. It just ruins everything!
14	15 6 13 1 34 33 28 20 3 31	I hope they're not talking about me
14	21 32 35 2 30 22 15 8 5 26	What's inside those holes? I think I see a flashing red dot, somebody is recording me!
14	25 30 12 32 21 1 26 20 35 23	These towers should have nets around them.
14	10 30 33 29 13 15 19 27 25 11	Do you want bird flu?  Because this is how you get bird flu.
14	34 30 17 20 10 23 31 2 35 25	Is she looking at me?
14	19 34 22 10 11 7 13 8 27 12	Oh, this makes my skin crawl - I can almost feel my face flaking.
14	5 16 28 25 20 19 6 31 15 24	this looks like a good place for a bomber..
14	16 12 4 3 9 30 18 32 5 35	I don't think that cup is microwave safe.  That could be one big cup of cancer.
14	8 27 15 4 18 17 11 2 34 10	I hope these children were watching there back.  Theres a kidnapper about.
14	19 1 7 32 22 11 21 17 24 9	I wonder exactly how long this meat has been sitting out?
14	35 20 30 16 9 12 4 25 15 28	I wouldn't be out there in the montains.
14	10 28 19 26 31 30 27 3 4 24	A bet the air marshal is always in these more comfortable seats.
14	25 2 16 35 3 13 30 31 28 12	Woah, this makes scared of heights for the hundredth time. What a wobbly looking structure.
14	10 5 22 30 24 6 17 33 9 4	What would happen if those buildings fall on us?
14	3 18 24 2 4 26 29 1 27 8	I am too high up right now
14	31 12 24 2 32 18 8 17 21 22	Rain is on the horizon.
14	24 34 26 33 17 12 29 7 31 5	Why is he dressed like that? Is he a pervert?
14	13 32 9 8 1 11 5 17 34 20	I think this tank is going to blow up.
14	10 23 35 3 18 7 5 15 8 19	I wonder if those teeth are sharp.
14	31 11 5 4 18 32 7 16 2 13	This guy is always sitting out there at this time of day.  I wonder what he is plotting.
14	6 17 19 21 7 31 22 32 33 35	All of these people are making me claustrophobic.
14	11 7 6 17 15 22 20 10 32 31	It is a nice big crosswalk, but on the city streets theres always people racing through. I would be shaking
14	19 9 34 33 21 24 13 15 22 32	You would never get me on one of those things. I never trust that they're maintained properly.
14	3 23 31 34 5 33 4 15 27 7	I think that lady is getting ready to kill someone.
14	8 4 25 26 30 15 29 9 7 31	Don't slip, dont's slip, don't slip!
14	8 35 29 17 21 32 12 15 18 3	The masks hide their faces.
14	20 21 30 6 23 13 29 17 1 2	I don't trust her smile, I think she's up to something.
14	5 30 29 18 16 25 33 26 10 28	I know you said we were going to the basketball game, but how do I know you aren't a robot?
14	24 12 18 30 17 19 21 4 16 22	Hmm.. He's looks like he is about to rob somebody.
14	15 22 17 30 2 34 8 31 26 28	this flag might attract bulls
14	11 19 25 7 8 1 23 18 22 34	What is going on with tethered dog?
14	9 17 32 3 5 16 31 18 20 6	The man is on a strange bus.
14	26 9 19 24 8 27 6 30 17 23	Yeah, what is he showing her. Doesn't look good.
14	28 10 29 9 24 21 5 13 3 1	This massive rock looks like a sleeping ghost
14	24 21 29 19 9 30 2 18 27 4	why does everyone look so serious what did I do?
14	20 11 15 25 4 5 21 10 18 31	I wonder if the food here is ok to many germs
14	6 1 24 3 2 9 19 21 5 25	That looks so scary, I bet there are sharks just waiting in there.
14	23 19 7 21 33 13 26 25 1 11	I think she's running from a serious attack!
14	35 25 26 11 21 31 22 24 17 12	I think that the people behind this christmas tree stand are up to no good.
14	22 4 20 18 25 33 27 5 3 29	I am scared of nature because of bears
14	32 12 22 30 7 10 27 16 21 23	I feel like I overdressed for the occasion.
14	22 26 9 28 11 7 16 1 19 8	Sure, it looks harmless, but just wait until it starts spinning.
14	6 25 26 16 17 13 33 22 15 27	I would not eat that not even knowing what they put in it.
14	3 24 23 19 9 27 34 6 12 7	I think there is a ghost in that building.
14	34 33 5 24 13 4 27 28 3 20	That sign is going to fall on me.
14	16 32 30 23 26 1 21 9 22 5	I hope no one falls in the water.
14	13 7 30 26 24 19 1 17 32 5	What if this house is haunted?
14	31 29 21 30 27 22 10 23 15 32	Someone's going to get hurt.
14	31 20 17 30 29 8 32 13 15 23	I would be so scared that one of those fireworks would end up hitting me, I don't think I could go here.
14	15 19 35 18 22 10 30 9 26 8	There are probably snakes all over the place there.
14	3 2 5 23 26 30 22 29 1 9	I swear to god I bet those two in the back are keeping to themselves cause they've got something they don't want me to hear, and that prick sitting to the right of them does not look too pleasant either.
14	25 20 33 30 31 1 12 19 18 2	I think no matter how much shrubbery is around someone is always watching us.
14	2 8 25 29 32 5 28 24 20 18	i think these guys look mean
14	15 18 30 24 6 28 17 29 2 27	There's definitely a spy in that village
14	26 32 33 23 11 7 2 10 34 27	That brooms gonna fall over. Someone please do something. Anyone. Please.
14	25 5 19 10 6 20 18 16 32 23	Those people are crazy for leaning on that wall. It might collapse and they would fall!
14	3 26 1 28 2 6 30 29 35 18	The tombstone is surrounded by empty space.
14	4 35 15 32 25 21 16 19 23 3	Birds like this talked to me once.
14	24 2 35 5 4 26 19 8 29 7	I'm not sure I'd be able to do this with my kids - I'd be worried they'll hurt themselves.
14	24 6 9 13 32 35 1 17 2 19	I pray this dog doesn't have rabies.
14	3 19 21 4 20 9 17 16 11 6	No railings by those arches?  How dangerous.
14	27 23 2 21 7 17 31 33 25 20	OMG! This window is so big, ANYONE could be watching me through it!
14	22 8 3 7 32 34 21 23 12 24	I hope those tree branches don't fall through the glass.
14	31 22 7 20 28 21 33 13 6 24	I’m not walking that way
14	13 26 4 12 29 1 34 5 6 22	I hope they got the whole setup right for the whole dining table! Each guest must be comfortable! Else what is the point of setting up immaculate presentations for dining?
14	22 24 12 29 26 9 28 31 25 20	somethings definitey up with this picture
14	6 25 15 31 13 30 18 3 4 2	Looks like they're coming right for you. Scary
14	1 32 13 33 21 24 17 5 9 10	Someone should check the backseat for murderers.
14	13 18 30 15 24 26 29 20 16 11	what if the sign fall.
14	31 3 20 34 24 1 4 25 2 29	I bet these two are government agents documenting everything that is happening in the room.
14	5 15 11 2 32 1 33 7 23 22	These building are black ops sites.
14	28 30 34 19 33 7 18 8 17 5	Why is that baby outside, the baby is going to geet sunburn or really hot.
14	25 21 10 18 31 22 4 5 33 24	The sun is staring at me. I swear it's following me.
14	17 31 30 35 22 2 9 32 28 6	Those girls should have shoes on they could step on glass or something.
14	10 31 1 5 30 2 18 27 12 15	This is a nice sweater but wait is this a sweater/ it looks like the top part s a sweater then the other half is a cotton shirt. It almost like they cut the these purposely and sew it together to make fashion but what is the button for in the middle? And is this had made? Because what if it falls apart when its washed?
14	33 16 7 5 27 24 35 34 10 22	The evidence that dinosaurs exist has finally come to light.
14	7 24 2 6 27 34 18 9 5 4	The wine station is left unattended meaning underage individuals can get to it.
14	34 1 28 25 13 18 5 22 6 29	Is she REALLY a virgin?
14	4 10 9 17 27 22 26 30 6 11	There has to be ants behind that cake.
14	2 24 1 13 16 32 30 7 22 27	I think they are planning to blow up my city.
14	32 20 8 25 27 30 24 22 7 11	Man, I hope nobody switched out shaving cream for ice cream.
14	18 25 32 33 21 23 26 17 29 35	I really hope they are not on LSD.
14	15 31 1 25 19 13 11 27 21 3	I wouldn't eat that pie because I have no idea how clean this cook's kitchen is.
14	8 35 2 26 5 31 24 4 33 30	I get really worried when I see cars with tinted windows drive by me
14	19 3 21 30 16 1 27 22 28 26	Im sure this plant is poisonous
14	15 5 8 9 30 25 2 32 4 22	I wouldn't want to live so close to a wasteland....who knows whats out there?
14	25 32 20 7 15 34 1 28 2 22	I think that fire is out of control.
14	2 25 8 20 10 21 1 30 16 23	I hope my children don't get lost in this crowd.
14	26 34 8 13 19 27 22 15 3 23	Think those chairs might be sentient?
14	35 12 24 1 22 16 4 23 2 11	Just sitting here waiting for something to jump out of the water!
14	27 22 20 28 26 24 4 30 11 6	All I see is endless blue and no way out.
14	13 11 27 33 10 15 5 6 17 7	Someone spiked her drink. This is why I don't go partying.
14	18 32 19 6 23 10 2 4 29 31	I would have been too scared to take this picture
14	20 12 23 3 19 21 2 10 16 7	Omg what if they all crash? What if their brakes fail?
14	19 15 2 5 7 8 20 33 26 24	Is he looking at me?
14	35 5 30 4 20 12 2 10 23 3	The canal boat contains a secret government team tasked with silencing anyone who speaks out against them
14	19 17 9 6 20 21 33 11 15 4	Stop kissing me in public
14	24 18 3 20 6 17 4 12 33 5	Wondering what this kid is up to.
14	3 20 21 5 8 25 10 11 17 22	Oh no they are taking a picture
14	29 24 4 3 18 20 25 12 28 35	He's going to double cross them.
14	9 34 28 26 35 31 6 22 27 11	I bet I'm allergenic to those.
14	17 31 12 9 15 11 2 7 27 20	I think this church is haunted.
14	29 15 4 22 30 21 5 9 23 31	I would be so scared that all of the boxes would fall over and make a complete mess!
14	10 32 25 3 4 19 7 9 1 28	Hockey looks so fun, but I'm always worried about other players secretly trying to kill or kidnap me
14	13 1 31 7 6 24 10 35 26 27	That's too much water. There's no telling what kind of creatures are lurking in there.
14	11 5 2 26 30 18 25 13 15 33	Dressing like this can cause attacks.
14	22 33 26 24 34 27 20 15 8 12	There is a bomb in the crowd
14	18 13 19 12 21 5 32 17 11 1	The sandwich is looking at me...
14	15 34 11 27 9 10 6 32 4 19	This is a sign that they are coming for us.
14	20 22 32 17 19 10 29 18 28 30	everyone else brought there food in aluminum trays, but I brought a basket! I hope they don't think I'm weird.
14	10 13 17 12 8 2 20 29 5 22	This is the color aliens use
14	28 15 12 8 34 20 22 11 10 5	Each one of those antenna is just another listening tower to keep us all in check and you know it.
14	4 6 11 25 32 3 10 17 29 16	i'm scared the kids will be injured by a car in the lot.
14	23 26 21 1 25 30 17 18 24 11	There's too many eyes here.
14	15 34 26 35 21 28 10 24 29 12	Does this have that cancer sugar in it?
14	35 31 15 11 32 6 16 9 27 7	Not quite sure if their cause is good or bad.
14	18 21 6 4 9 24 16 5 32 7	Is that an American Airline? I hope it's not a terrorist.
14	4 16 27 29 1 2 15 5 19 6	Those rocks are a bit sharp, watch out!
14	23 5 6 26 3 16 15 19 32 24	Is that too much water on the flowers? Will they drowned? I hope they aren’t too wet. They might be too wet.
14	19 18 11 15 6 25 22 20 16 23	Why have I seen her in other photos?
14	12 35 32 31 27 17 1 10 6 2	Looks like it could crumble at any second
14	4 30 18 9 33 28 6 5 35 23	I wonder what caused all these holes?
14	20 27 30 32 31 2 33 29 15 17	I wonder if the ingredients in this were toxic.
14	29 32 19 11 13 35 2 9 30 7	This purple reminds me of today's horoscope of impending doom.
14	16 31 18 11 8 28 25 30 15 4	What! is compleatly innapropiate  this message! someone can go addicted  if we continue suggesting use substances!!
14	20 27 30 23 29 33 12 28 22 35	Is my computer broken? I only see purple
14	25 18 28 19 35 3 7 10 32 16	That's a huge building.  It looks like Afganastan, somewhere I would not go.
14	7 15 29 22 33 4 6 25 1 27	hey buddy, give me the stick you could get a splinter
14	5 21 22 9 29 16 34 12 25 15	She looks possessed, is she okay?
14	12 11 23 21 6 7 25 10 35 28	He's going to fly out of that window!
14	9 13 2 5 24 19 29 33 16 28	Why is the tongue sticking out?
14	23 17 9 22 33 30 1 16 34 19	Why would they be dressed like that?!
14	7 8 26 6 13 30 27 25 20 29	Don't step on her toes.
14	23 29 12 16 15 20 34 1 17 19	I hope they don't get hurt in their match.
14	2 18 22 17 7 26 11 8 12 13	I would be worried the trolley would hit me.
14	35 24 1 21 13 15 25 17 30 26	That painting looks out of place, are you sure there's not a camera behind it?
14	24 11 21 5 7 27 18 29 30 16	I wonder what the true meaning is behind all these small symbols on the cross.
14	22 16 31 23 8 17 1 26 15 19	Are construction workers slacking off, or were they...taken?
14	34 4 15 18 10 20 25 16 9 32	Trains often kill many pedestrians who are not paying attention.
14	18 1 12 7 24 34 8 3 6 11	Someone's gonna get hit in that road!
14	8 28 15 26 13 3 11 4 19 18	Watch out for the chemtrails.
14	5 1 24 33 16 12 32 26 4 34	These lights will blind someone!
14	13 23 29 16 15 6 17 2 18 34	OMG, all of these people are after me
14	23 6 34 1 15 22 8 16 21 13	A creepy man in a unknown location.
14	17 2 26 24 4 13 6 9 3 19	That doesn't exactly look safe... and what the heck are those blue dots?!
14	2 25 4 9 29 13 26 8 34 16	I would be skeptical playing this rough.
14	21 34 1 4 20 32 3 29 17 9	This looks way too loud for me.
14	28 35 13 27 4 15 33 9 8 22	What a large train, I hope there are no robbers in it!
14	18 8 1 20 9 21 16 7 34 17	I bet that food has germs.
14	24 11 7 8 13 35 2 33 15 5	I didn't start the fire, it was my mother!
14	25 9 5 1 13 7 16 4 28 6	That looks dangerous, i'd be scared that spider would eat me.
14	6 35 17 22 18 25 11 31 32 28	all those cords make me paranoid
14	4 16 35 15 23 31 21 8 10 19	The man is very skeptical about what's going on
15	14 34 1 22 35 11 17 2 3 28	Congrats! I'm very happy for you.
15	18 17 14 2 23 32 1 21 3 16	This is an utterly relaxing landscape. Could imagine looking out at this vista every single morning over a cup of tea.
15	21 24 18 17 11 16 27 12 7 25	The kids are playing so nice
15	35 3 33 24 2 34 10 27 9 28	Quite a cute critter, he looks like a good boy.
15	29 17 32 4 28 30 6 10 19 20	I can fall asleep when I get my car washed here
15	11 9 30 26 4 14 23 35 32 29	The fish are disturbing the nice water.
15	25 2 14 23 12 5 13 4 7 10	These people are waiting to cross the street.
15	33 30 2 25 31 19 3 12 18 20	No way am I kissing that
15	32 11 33 3 29 14 10 7 22 5	Awaiting the musical smoothness of the band
15	3 23 7 28 35 33 17 34 22 10	so serious in this picture. she's got that "vogue" kinda look!
15	3 11 2 26 1 10 32 14 7 8	I know you'll make it down the dune just fine.
15	17 2 13 12 18 5 26 4 10 14	I am sure he will be safe when he skates.
15	31 7 14 32 1 25 30 20 2 12	I bet those people are happy and having a good time
15	13 34 33 29 3 31 14 28 8 22	SHE BELIEVES TO BE TINA TURNER
15	8 2 29 9 22 33 26 18 32 7	I believe we can move that dresser without a problem this weekend.
15	17 10 31 32 11 8 23 29 34 26	A family photo of a nice family.
15	28 33 21 4 31 14 30 2 23 13	Love that feeling of a quiet morning when the streets are empty.
15	5 13 17 7 1 4 16 9 34 33	About to relax and write a book...
15	33 12 2 23 20 28 17 22 32 3	This photo makes me feel so relax
15	17 2 34 19 28 4 31 24 29 8	Camping is such a relaxing activity.
15	9 3 26 23 10 14 28 27 29 18	Are they about to fall over?
15	12 18 35 1 25 3 26 33 11 22	Looks like everyone had a good time.
15	5 33 34 14 17 26 20 6 31 3	finally some peace and quiet
15	4 29 30 34 23 11 10 5 2 3	Ah, to sit here and read a book
15	14 3 29 8 28 31 1 7 27 25	This stoic look can definitely bring out different emotions in people even surrounded by illegible graffiti.
15	16 26 6 27 19 1 14 30 9 20	Random Palm tree, thats cool.
15	27 4 11 17 30 34 8 13 2 1	What a lovely shade of purple!
15	26 21 20 14 8 31 34 17 4 27	This is pleasing and tranquil color.
15	33 35 2 3 1 9 31 34 25 19	They seem attentive to something happening, probably just listening to some speaker off screen.
15	5 31 30 29 33 35 34 7 14 8	It looks like the food is laid out and ready to go.
15	29 24 33 4 21 2 5 26 31 30	This color green is really chill and relaxing.
15	24 30 28 1 6 25 21 27 5 18	Who drew on my pumpkin?
15	5 22 19 18 3 35 2 25 10 33	Memorabilia is important later in age. It triggers memories and a sense of nostalgia.
15	30 35 18 23 19 22 12 9 31 24	The grandeur of the church makes one feel at piece.
15	22 29 25 26 23 16 19 11 20 4	Amazing how sophisticated our docks have become when compared to the descriptions of yesteryear.
15	5 31 17 18 13 33 6 35 23 1	The water feels like I do today, with abundance to give, yet pleasant and relaxed.
15	3 21 10 23 33 32 19 13 20 17	I like the black and white choice.
15	1 29 22 18 26 4 30 33 21 16	The statue fills me with serenity.
15	13 29 20 27 4 6 14 22 9 26	Let's take a moment to reflect on this space and its history.
15	33 12 6 31 4 21 23 11 19 34	I wouldn't mind relaxing and making one of these myself.
15	1 35 27 7 29 8 6 34 28 12	This looks like fun, but I'd rather relax right now.
15	23 24 19 12 25 5 30 35 14 2	Imagine rolling down this hill and then sipping on some delicious milk.
15	23 25 14 2 31 32 17 7 30 20	The water is so peaceful.
15	21 12 26 13 14 25 33 18 7 17	A group of kids are in the park and they are enjoying
15	28 10 3 1 11 7 19 35 16 13	Calm seas and clear skies like this are so relaxing.
15	12 5 32 25 22 4 17 2 3 23	Views like this are lovely, really helps you relax!
15	23 34 19 33 9 7 8 18 27 3	It's nice to take a drive and notice the beautiful landscape around you.
15	20 13 19 5 34 21 25 29 30 24	What a nice place to take a quiet stroll.
15	11 22 24 9 33 18 14 19 34 27	All I want to do it pet him and take him for a long quite walk.

20	26 7 16 33 27 31 35 1 14 23	Clearly I've been guided to the wrong party.

20	3 12 9 1 25 8 34 23 6 30	If I were in this picture I would politely hand the person in the green shirt a nicely folded, clean towel to allow him to dry himself off.  Then I would take a sip from my champagne flute.

20	5 23 32 24 31 22 28 14 18 10	What is impressive about sports, is the formations they form.
20	33 12 7 1 14 34 19 8 25 22	This is tacky looking. I would prefer a realistic portrayal of the beach, such as a woman in a long dress.
20	25 11 5 31 10 34 30 29 24 33	I can see myself driving here in a luxurious car
20	13 8 19 24 32 35 33 23 30 10	Preparing for our ocean voyage.

20	19 3 34 10 15 35 6 8 25 23	This is not where I want to be. Please take me to a boutique.
20	13 34 3 14 25 11 10 33 7 5	Don't forget your hat and cane when visiting.
20	14 24 16 22 28 11 13 10 3 2	This band is quite great!
20	4 30 14 29 17 32 10 35 2 13	I feel we made a very lasting impression tonight.
20	19 14 21 24 30 28 25 35 3 9	MANY MANS STANDING ONE PLACE
20	21 26 5 18 15 19 33 31 3 4	Oh what a fancy bikini.
20	10 25 30 19 14 33 1 23 13 3	This is a most divine view of the mountains.
20	4 28 27 9 10 14 2 25 1 17	how smooth they glide across the stage
20	31 5 22 2 27 32 6 21 26 4	Such a beautiful family, they seem quite happy.
20	2 32 12 18 19 11 23 7 6 13	What beautiful colors and lights in the city.
20	26 29 17 9 14 10 25 21 15 3	What lovely chattering and connecting they're doing.
20	32 26 17 5 9 18 12 30 29 4	These houses need a chandelier
20	3 30 26 1 10 7 23 13 4 31	The lights and music look magnificent.
20	19 22 4 8 24 16 34 25 33 35	A great place to have a romantic dinner.
20	27 4 19 9 18 3 17 34 33 2	I love the way the colors in this photo work with the lines and symmetry.
20	5 28 32 9 11 23 12 13 21 22	The most sophisticated event in town.
20	6 1 32 31 25 16 10 30 11 17	that mushroom is very elegant looking.
20	11 4 1 29 16 31 34 30 23 19	Lovely evening in the city.
20	1 19 34 32 22 29 15 27 4 23	this is perfect portraiture proportion
21	8 10 19 5 9 7 4 16 33 6	makes me think of history
21	35 2 5 17 10 13 19 24 12 11	there has got to be some other way i can organize this.
21	8 22 24 19 18 15 31 7 9 1	Someone must have carefully stitched that together...
21	27 9 7 4 2 14 25 11 13 35	I hope hes smart enough not go jog to far into the desert.
21	11 13 27 22 10 12 17 34 8 33	This seems like a possible fire risk.
21	28 8 11 6 27 31 34 4 35 33	running towards the fixed goal thats almost a never ending one
21	17 31 26 33 1 25 35 16 12 20	The picture is unalb eto be displayed
21	31 35 20 19 9 29 23 22 2 3	The careful lines of the pavement make one feel cold and logical.
21	23 3 6 7 28 35 2 14 34 29	It says it rained last night makes sense my car and grass were wet this morning
21	12 18 23 20 5 7 8 9 29 32	The grass needs to be redone from all the rough playing.
21	15 11 18 16 31 7 26 22 8 10	Beautiful color, some trees would look good on this.
21	32 31 10 3 9 35 30 13 27 4	It Seems They Are Playing Some Sort of Sport
21	16 1 27 14 5 11 32 33 6 17	He is getting married and waiting for his bride.  Don't know what's up with that leopard thing.
21	6 20 25 15 10 4 18 33 34 35	This was taken years ago.
21	1 29 13 5 10 28 34 23 11 20	This part of earth is turning away from the sun and darkness is the result
21	23 4 16 31 19 27 6 2 22 8	If you scoot that car over a little, you could fit some more stuff in that spacious garage!
21	8 13 11 26 7 6 15 18 31 5	This is a picture of two boys and a girl.
21	1 33 4 16 30 32 12 27 15 25	People will enjoy these brightly colored active dancers.
21	15 13 3 7 25 4 16 22 2 14	The little boy looks like he know exactly what he is bout to draw.
21	28 20 2 26 25 24 35 1 23 5	I think that are watching the sky.
21	34 16 4 1 27 18 5 9 30 24	I wonder what even or phenomenon those people at the summit are gathered for.
21	15 2 16 30 17 18 12 26 29 31	This plan is probably red to attract insects.
21	33 10 12 13 6 14 2 1 26 35	Getting cars parked and people across the street is tricky.
21	35 18 16 25 11 13 26 23 6 14	The speech they are listening to is very coherent.
21	26 33 5 22 17 15 19 10 29 27	that guy  must be 6 foot tall.
21	33 29 10 24 16 23 31 34 26 6	This beach needs to be protected so the animal are protected.
21	7 18 35 17 32 4 30 28 24 34	It's dark in this room actually. You can tell because there is a candle lit and the flash only makes part of the room bright.
21	6 13 15 17 25 10 18 32 12 28	The reflections juxtaposed with the architecture is quite enthralling.
21	25 32 19 24 35 11 16 7 34 3	I see 4 people in this picture. Cool.
21	16 18 4 2 27 14 13 35 22 26	The statute appears to be contemplating life with a cold logic.
21	20 1 9 25 4 31 29 2 23 22	I wonder how long it took for that bird to be placed up there?
21	22 34 17 30 12 1 9 5 18 27	He must have just graduted
21	35 10 9 1 17 5 8 33 7 19	A plastic paddle boat can show a past when workman ship counts. This is ornate.
21	32 15 13 7 18 34 17 8 31 2	The illusion of her floating torso is caused by he lighting and her dark pants.
21	27 4 3 17 14 11 35 32 29 1	The dance has a discernible purpose and meaning.
21	7 5 24 15 9 20 1 2 34 11	Those young woman aren't dressed properly for riding motorcycles.
21	30 14 13 19 23 7 11 5 20 26	This s a pretty engagement photo
21	16 5 7 10 33 22 25 17 18 31	It seems the police are handcuffing them with draw ties..?
21	1 27 15 28 11 3 10 9 33 14	Wwow the polive department has done so much for us in the last years
21	9 26 25 32 15 2 22 12 31 3	I would like to know when this was built and for what purpose.
21	23 18 1 11 25 8 34 22 33 2	This is a group of seven young adults.
21	25 31 26 9 11 32 1 35 23 20	There must be a staircase inside
21	27 3 17 7 25 24 9 14 11 16	Of course two vases need to be held to provide the photo with a sense of symmetry.
21	22 23 30 16 4 24 27 26 1 34	IT'S REALISTIC TO THINK THE BRACEFACE FARTED
21	32 10 11 5 2 15 23 8 25 26	such a nice group of friends
21	3 15 14 11 13 10 31 22 26 2	That is kind of offensive.
21	29 22 14 30 25 13 20 10 17 16	This window is transparent. You can see right through it.
21	23 29 17 16 14 30 26 13 28 18	If one leaped over the rail, the likelihood of survival is extremely low.
21	28 10 16 26 2 22 13 23 7 20	his craftsmanship makes perfect sense to me
21	35 14 10 12 29 4 25 26 34 22	They need a disclaimer on the right statue: "Standing on top of statues is not recommended"
21	6 5 20 17 7 24 33 28 25 9	The finishing in this building is very well conceived
21	19 15 27 31 11 6 25 14 29 2	I know I would not like this band, but I had to come to the concert.
21	11 30 19 25 24 6 17 4 31 14	If light is scattering as a rainbow, there's likely a piece of glass acting as a prism.
21	2 12 35 10 4 14 18 32 1 3	he is about to day something
21	7 2 34 24 28 27 9 16 33 17	The driveway is not safe because it is icy
21	14 6 5 31 15 16 17 4 7 23	Green is the color of wealth.
21	24 30 35 16 13 23 15 25 19 2	The gathering of  people is showing the popularity of the spot.
21	35 7 31 2 32 25 12 3 33 17	no more drinks. we have to drive
21	26 3 23 11 6 22 35 14 28 18	That's a cool time lapse photo. What was the exposure time on your camera?
21	2 1 17 33 28 25 34 24 7 30	This makes so much sense because it's spring
21	28 8 15 6 20 11 12 35 24 9	Easy driving.  No traffic!
21	23 6 35 34 20 33 25 2 12 19	It would require a lot of effort to spray paint that graffiti on those posts.
21	32 3 24 9 35 19 33 27 6 30	The power lines are going at 45 degree angles, that must be the most efficient way to do it.
21	2 1 29 19 15 10 18 35 25 24	The mountains are in the background and the trees are in the forefront.
21	11 29 26 8 5 1 10 24 7 18	This scenery is so beautiful.
21	14 27 30 5 16 33 29 32 11 20	A long path to a countryside cottage.
21	22 20 14 30 16 1 9 13 10 7	It makes sense to use this vehicle for that kind of job.
21	13 25 1 23 33 19 26 2 28 12	Class presentations are great for building confidence.
21	2 30 1 34 23 3 33 4 14 12	It might be a good idea for the photographer to get out of the water right now, unless he/she is thoroughly protected.
21	16 27 6 30 32 23 4 9 13 3	Clearly, this place needs some repairs.
21	19 13 15 28 22 1 16 25 27 12	This speaker has a really good point, he is quite skilled and logical.
21	19 11 26 2 7 30 10 23 29 20	I see the vibrant luminescence, what a scene for a fun time!
21	12 25 28 1 5 22 31 19 34 8	That's a well put-together outfit. The white contrasts nicely with the black.
21	34 7 23 16 22 8 10 13 35 9	so many fun times there.
21	26 17 4 16 1 5 6 11 18 31	I wonder how much electricity is used to power those lights?
21	19 24 4 26 25 27 9 35 18 20	This bird is one of the most aggressive of its kind when it comes to its family according to the handbook.
21	7 9 33 34 24 15 2 30 20 14	Capture the flag to play the objective in order to win the game
21	24 28 16 32 19 20 12 1 14 17	Precisely one fourth of a cupcake is a reasonable amount to share.
21	10 12 8 33 24 13 18 14 28 15	This is the color orange. I know this because it is orange.
21	6 31 17 7 15 10 25 35 16 33	An interesting presentation to a diplomat.
21	35 3 24 5 23 28 12 2 6 10	That tree looks like it has been there a few years.
21	35 32 1 11 29 10 15 26 3 13	Many years of training paid off!
21	30 19 31 9 23 11 29 2 12 8	Jim is enjoying a nice dinner tonight.
21	30 23 10 31 16 6 1 26 2 32	This looks like out of a SAW movie
21	19 11 29 1 4 3 28 27 31 7	Interesting they put the waterfall on the other side of the building.
21	26 33 15 32 31 20 12 18 14 2	She seems very fun to party with.
21	13 4 15 3 25 26 35 34 6 20	It makes total sense that beginners would be paired up together. I would love to try this out sometime.
21	7 28 9 35 2 6 12 4 16 5	Everyone listened to him intently as he spoke.
21	16 28 13 15 30 18 2 14 24 32	Standing at the top of a lighthouse may not be the best idea with out the proper safety equipment.
21	27 22 4 16 5 30 33 18 17 28	What is going on in this picture?
21	8 28 1 32 7 17 34 20 33 29	The way they are doing things makes sense.
21	29 5 28 32 19 24 8 33 27 14	The placement of the overhangs is clearly a design feature to allow light without blinding occupants.
21	18 32 20 1 13 23 6 11 15 17	The music made a lot of sense
21	8 20 18 10 29 1 17 31 15 16	If it is windy today I would be worried this tent would blow away.
21	31 33 14 10 17 13 18 9 19 16	Well, clearly this is a family that's getting together for relaxing fun.
21	17 20 1 14 19 15 8 26 4 11	The girls seem to be singing in unison.
21	8 3 28 34 26 18 20 29 17 14	He looks hot, so light clothes and bright colored clothes was a good choice.
21	14 23 24 19 31 3 32 33 16 7	The photo depicts a man looking through a dirty window while someone is tajing his picture or the camera lense is filthy.
21	20 9 22 33 19 10 2 17 14 4	Looks like someone has had a few bites already. Probably a very fancy restaurant.
21	29 17 10 12 16 28 25 32 1 8	Wearing shorts to a concert is smart to keep the players cool.
21	23 11 32 7 19 28 18 6 33 9	She's standing on the left side of the table, she's hiding her left arm, so maybe she is having problem with it. Or there's someone on the other side she doesn't like. I think the pic was taken during late fall/early winter because I can tell by the color and style of her outfit.
21	22 3 29 30 27 11 24 33 16 12	That must be apart of a movie set, being in such an undisturbed forest
21	35 5 20 9 8 28 10 22 7 32	The plant looks like a handheld fan.
21	18 11 15 2 29 5 32 20 17 14	Corn and flour are integral to our survival
21	9 14 3 8 2 13 34 4 29 22	A road less traveled is always an adventure
21	11 33 2 23 27 1 24 35 28 15	This tree is very old
21	19 34 8 31 15 27 23 3 20 10	the color coordination is outstanding
21	23 24 8 25 32 7 13 19 2 1	Well, there is water and a cup, so I don't imagine we will get wet.
21	12 6 13 8 10 3 27 23 14 17	With no clouds in the sky, I highly doubt it will rain there any time soon.
21	11 2 32 25 26 16 8 33 7 1	The snow remains on the top of the mountain due to the lower temperature at that elevation.
21	10 31 3 8 25 2 4 34 1 24	Why is the plant like that? What made it evolve to be like that?
21	17 10 32 33 7 31 8 15 6 22	This vehicle must have evolved from the 1960's VW surfer van conversions.
21	1 7 11 31 10 5 16 34 27 33	Dad taking care of baby
21	23 32 30 9 18 27 11 16 34 31	With this many people on the street, there must be a popular concert nearby.
21	23 32 14 28 35 25 30 20 15 18	Those do not look like the type of trees that grow well in a rainy climate.
21	17 12 10 16 7 31 33 14 8 3	this is a strange windmill
21	19 1 17 35 6 32 33 31 24 8	surely the newspapers will get stuck to the paint ? should have chosen a different non sticking materials
21	5 14 12 13 1 31 16 17 6 32	The designs are well thought out.
21	29 11 34 8 10 5 26 24 25 16	This cat is watching TV.  No other explanation for his pensive look.
21	14 17 16 32 30 2 35 20 3 9	youre not driving right. you need to get in the lines.
21	9 32 12 27 14 10 18 7 26 30	That water would most definitely be wet when he jumps in
21	34 28 32 7 15 33 13 26 25 6	9 jets flying in formation on a clear day.
21	7 25 26 29 12 18 9 35 6 27	This forest looks like a good place to find samples
21	15 35 17 11 7 6 19 22 14 33	Green and red are great colors
21	33 20 29 11 22 8 24 14 12 25	Someone needs to call for pest control.
21	22 32 13 19 30 16 1 8 12 26	If the artist knew what he was doing, then he would have left his markers in the box.
21	33 8 19 2 24 26 4 11 28 12	There are three things on the plate
21	14 6 3 34 35 11 12 30 1 28	The strongest structure is a triangle and therefore those bridge supports should last a long time.
21	13 1 29 9 11 20 32 14 25 26	The place is filled with minerals
21	27 1 3 30 4 6 11 17 22 24	Thinking logically, I would think they are graduating??
21	13 6 27 10 8 29 24 18 15 35	That goalie has blocked the kick with his hands.
21	19 22 6 11 17 2 1 31 9 24	She is just posing for the camera in front of a door.
21	1 15 18 26 14 16 34 27 30 2	This group of people may be at a gathering of intellectuals.
21	14 18 7 35 34 20 17 2 25 1	The most reasonable place to put a warehouse is out in the middle of no where
21	14 12 1 27 2 16 30 22 35 28	sleep on the bottom floor so we can get breakfast first
21	33 22 31 12 17 18 16 27 34 29	An island like this is so beautiful.
21	19 4 33 23 27 3 25 24 16 17	That lady looks intensely focused.
21	15 24 14 26 30 25 7 33 17 35	I think this picture would show better with more lighting.
21	4 15 25 31 6 20 19 26 30 12	Normal reasoning says that there is nobody in that compound
21	3 23 30 24 33 15 10 16 19 17	I believe that is Ellen's backyard.
21	16 8 18 4 27 3 14 17 10 20	This looks really good. I like how it's all spaced out like it is
21	16 29 17 27 20 8 34 2 4 30	Based on the sun position, the shadows seem all off.
21	16 35 26 19 8 18 34 17 22 7	This is simply a photo of geese among some trees.
21	25 17 18 30 7 11 10 20 16 8	The palm trees indicate a tropical location, but the the people are wearing pants so it must be their winter.
21	31 10 35 17 14 29 6 18 20 3	That room is not very lit.
21	16 18 11 29 26 20 27 10 30 3	They should both get down and settle it
21	7 6 10 8 19 11 12 16 25 9	He is a good actor.
21	25 35 23 16 13 31 18 24 3 2	This place looks like a nightmare to get out of after a crowded event.
21	10 13 18 4 14 6 32 2 11 20	The scenery is nice but this is a out of reach location with little amenities of comfort. You could become trapped off here very quickly.
21	24 27 19 31 9 13 7 15 28 11	This new father is promising love to his new baby.
21	5 24 1 10 27 25 20 12 11 29	It's very ironic, how that airplane looks like it right above his head.
21	11 3 28 6 27 7 9 2 24 32	Though the sign advertises with a drawing of an elephant, I doubt any elephant has ever tried beer.
21	22 2 9 25 31 33 16 4 24 13	If you want to get ahead you must attend these work conferences.
21	34 2 31 32 35 13 1 33 17 30	The crates are really great resources for holding the flowers.
21	16 35 30 10 3 33 7 24 27 1	Momentum is caused by force and speed.
21	5 15 7 35 34 33 1 30 31 12	This pictures is to dark to tell what is going on
21	23 14 17 10 28 3 6 4 18 34	This is an incredible example of natural camouflage at its finest.
21	13 4 17 19 26 9 18 16 7 8	I hope this cord doesn't tangle up his feet
21	22 34 17 13 9 16 1 2 23 19	This must be early morning, or the streets must be closed since there is nobody outside and the enviornment appears untouched.
21	5 33 2 15 29 32 26 4 27 19	Sportswear doesn't need to be fancy.
21	27 11 24 7 34 9 28 8 19 5	The bird should be freed
21	17 10 1 27 26 29 3 4 15 12	It doesn't look to me like he has the right angle to jump over that obstacle.
21	24 7 19 22 10 16 31 5 2 12	It looks like you are juggling tennis balls.
21	22 7 26 35 27 31 9 12 15 5	This is what happen after rain
21	8 26 24 16 31 13 10 30 15 20	let's just get what we need
21	24 8 13 29 22 33 10 19 30 4	That would be a difficult hill to climb.
21	28 6 22 8 19 11 30 20 5 10	I am sure that a school has a lot of garbage and need many dumpsters.
21	8 19 25 18 22 15 26 16 23 29	I see the faces in thought.
21	22 28 3 15 7 33 23 9 13 35	This is an unreal scenario.
21	23 17 9 33 15 28 29 35 5 8	Do not enter the water if you do not know how to swim.
21	27 29 7 11 10 15 35 17 13 31	Two boats going in two directions opposite one another will not wreck.
21	9 2 15 24 26 12 29 8 16 33	It was smart of the artist to complete the work in panels so they can easily be changed or maintained.
21	35 28 30 9 33 19 14 31 7 10	The logical architecture is so unique!
21	26 8 3 25 1 29 6 34 31 11	This couple are going to have sand all over and in their clothing.
21	5 2 15 34 8 24 6 7 28 16	This car can go fast
21	30 6 28 35 9 16 18 33 17 13	This picture is very outstanding, Good Drawing.
21	7 28 35 29 3 16 18 8 10 34	this lady is holding the baby in a upright position. which is good
21	5 3 27 10 8 2 16 30 13 20	the city s growth positively increases the migrants
21	8 12 2 11 33 24 23 27 13 10	This is so high up
21	4 16 6 33 30 34 1 14 23 31	this must be a horse race
21	2 25 15 23 33 32 27 19 31 34	We really could use some more chairs
21	15 19 11 22 20 7 5 17 31 8	why is that man wearing christmas decor?
21	4 8 27 29 12 34 25 18 13 28	Many people came to visit this place
21	20 27 23 19 30 6 9 28 1 5	The design and architecture is a bit extravegant, but it does provide some great imagery.
21	25 32 11 17 14 16 23 8 34 31	It makes sense that this person is shooting their bow toward the outdoors.
21	18 25 12 15 8 27 20 32 14 6	The site of nature makes one see the thought behind the universe.
21	26 27 29 8 34 18 10 14 17 7	Women with their hands on their faces.  That will give you pimples though.
21	25 16 17 9 20 22 24 5 14 28	Well, thats an ugly baby.  All babies are ugly.  There for... good job.
21	30 8 5 29 31 3 32 22 23 10	The GAZA twins are sad.
21	33 23 29 32 27 7 8 12 3 26	This appears to be a fancy and well funded display of fireworks based on the distinct pattern in this image.
21	33 25 12 6 10 34 8 22 2 5	The guy on the right is about to join the labor pool
21	13 10 23 14 25 26 15 28 5 9	They look like they're drawing a lot.
21	2 25 1 33 26 30 18 28 10 13	i wonder where that logo cames from
21	18 10 2 4 30 5 24 27 14 28	I know this is intelligent.
21	5 31 3 19 28 26 25 33 15 23	This flower appears to be white.
21	11 6 25 16 14 9 18 24 26 12	i think they're going to win.
21	17 25 23 20 16 2 13 12 4 26	Whoever planted those trees arranged them very well.
21	32 24 6 1 5 29 15 26 8 11	Looking at the sun's degree of showing in this image I can deduce that it must be sunrise.
21	15 33 34 11 20 22 35 7 17 1	thats cute but fix your animals!
21	29 20 22 16 6 8 15 23 34 12	THINK LOGICALLY WHAT IS THIS?
21	25 15 12 2 22 29 33 24 10 8	This must be in an asian city outdoor market.
21	10 35 19 16 34 32 31 6 20 18	THIS BUS MUST DRIVE FOR THE LA RAMS.
21	32 24 26 18 34 12 20 9 11 6	Given the placement of this historic looking statue this must have been a well respected man.
21	11 3 33 35 4 15 19 28 32 34	Well, I suppose this dentures help this woman feel better about herself.
21	17 35 4 10 16 33 34 22 12 28	Clearly the best spot in town to watch a sunset.
21	8 28 23 35 13 11 7 24 3 30	gravity is making this person go down the street fast
21	18 32 30 26 11 17 19 35 33 6	Looks like they should stop running shotgun and pound the rock more.
21	13 11 10 14 34 2 8 5 33 4	Two are better then 1. A perfect match
21	29 16 17 28 13 8 35 24 23 6	I wonder what time of day that was taken. Not a soul in sight, though it is clearly daytime.
21	3 29 14 9 5 28 19 10 7 24	The symmetry of the stained glass was functional to the architecture.
21	4 30 3 10 19 27 9 20 17 6	The people appear to be looking at some subject out of frame.
21	16 33 17 24 5 9 29 11 8 2	An animal like this attacks straight forward so my best bet is to flank him and come from behind.
21	30 29 12 4 15 35 24 1 17 7	For directions you'll just go straight around the riverbend
21	3 31 8 23 7 11 33 1 34 13	This was built to welcome a lot of people
21	30 4 6 20 12 32 28 1 29 15	She should kick the ball to the left since the goalie isn't protecting that area.
21	2 24 3 6 35 4 22 31 1 33	Someone needs to retreat that wall.
21	29 11 24 26 34 19 13 5 1 18	The vignette brings attention to the spire at the center
21	10 16 9 13 24 18 2 15 28 7	The lady should be on the donkey
21	27 18 19 3 29 23 28 15 31 16	This graffiti is legal and warranted.
21	7 32 4 16 26 35 11 31 24 13	This is definitely a picture of green...
21	15 35 23 20 17 11 1 34 18 22	kids probably shouldn't see that
21	29 14 28 30 16 23 2 33 31 22	This is quite an interesting structure. I wonder how far it extends above the fog.
21	18 8 3 7 11 22 10 24 19 32	The bird is searching for food.
21	33 8 12 19 1 23 35 24 28 31	She must be the grandmother
21	24 3 26 25 32 17 19 16 14 20	The stones make you feel there is logic in nature.
21	33 24 23 22 20 31 30 25 15 34	this is a perfect spot for a sewer release, as everything drains into the water.
21	5 25 2 7 30 32 35 6 13 9	An excellent look at an English musician from the 60s with a number of hits to rival The Beatles'.
21	32 18 24 8 2 12 20 10 34 31	So many complex parts to make a car go, really requires serious knowledge to fix it
21	18 25 28 6 20 24 35 13 1 23	Why isn’t he wearing his sunglasses. The sun is out
21	2 12 17 8 18 19 30 35 14 3	This common rabbit is startled to find humanity encroaching on its territory.
21	15 10 31 29 4 33 32 6 27 22	This is all trash from those campers.
21	19 8 25 24 26 32 29 10 18 9	Since the flute player is blurry, he must be moving quite a bit with the music.
21	1 19 26 35 32 5 13 20 33 7	So beautiful, but they have such a short bloom and the petals will soon fall.
21	13 8 19 25 28 30 29 9 10 27	Yeah, this bred of dogs loves to play, cute, normal picture!
21	13 25 22 10 35 11 17 8 18 7	that ball cannot be headed to this guy's bat. doesnt look logical
21	32 8 15 23 3 1 19 2 4 5	Really?  Just grab onto the next one.
21	30 23 29 7 18 12 10 33 2 19	It looks like they're setup to do this effectively.
21	17 10 30 19 20 25 5 22 34 24	I assume the water is on the other side of the lighthouse?
21	6 3 26 18 15 27 2 11 22 5	This hue is a combination of red and blue.
21	16 10 14 31 5 17 13 22 9 32	Well I dont think mail is running today
21	17 4 29 14 5 30 12 1 33 19	This all adds up to nothing
21	24 30 17 9 12 23 34 26 14 18	It must be sunny out
21	34 27 22 30 31 15 11 16 19 33	I think this man is in thought.
21	32 26 27 25 23 22 13 8 28 5	The dolphins must be swimming in a group
21	13 22 35 6 2 8 16 15 11 10	He is going to swing the bat
21	11 7 17 35 26 18 25 31 1 33	It makes sense to low ride your car because you want to stay close to the ground on icy conditions so you don't flip your car.
21	17 19 25 15 13 9 26 3 2 1	The flag is blowing, so it must be windy.
21	23 10 30 34 22 32 4 5 25 27	It looks fairly organized to me. The plants all line up nicely.
21	32 30 22 34 5 7 16 8 1 2	the sunset colors is a beauty
21	31 22 25 33 20 11 10 19 14 18	This beautiful scene formed all on its own through thousands of years of nature.
21	28 2 20 9 6 34 27 19 5 24	The air balloon shape like egg
21	18 10 31 13 25 29 9 19 3 17	the best way to run track is with the right track shoes
21	18 28 23 12 31 16 11 24 1 27	All we need to do is cut the tip and fill the sock with sand
21	24 29 16 4 20 28 17 7 5 27	This man looks like a great teacher.
21	28 2 30 29 10 17 26 15 20 16	This appears to be a test vehicle.
21	17 1 12 10 22 16 28 8 29 3	I knew my family was different but we all had the same peaceful logical heart.
21	7 1 11 25 16 29 30 12 20 24	Music plays either from speakers or in their heads.
21	27 12 13 30 28 25 22 4 6 29	THE BUILDING ON THE LEFT LOOKS MORE MODERN
21	28 19 27 13 33 17 12 31 34 2	A lot of work goes into making the singer look good.
21	4 27 16 23 26 13 29 34 8 33	He is an important figure
21	8 5 34 7 24 10 18 22 14 15	I wounder how much it costs to run all of that electric when there's hardly anyone in any of those rooms.
21	32 29 17 27 9 15 6 31 11 34	Why is there no lighting?
21	8 26 22 28 16 13 5 17 19 31	Smart, taking a nap under shade.
21	9 23 33 7 24 27 15 22 14 18	All of us meets an end in some way or another.
21	11 34 22 1 31 9 32 35 28 16	What a perfect place to go hiking and then sit and have a picnic all according to our schedule!
21	13 17 29 32 8 14 12 20 23 10	This car is very fast
21	18 26 30 2 31 22 1 15 13 8	clearly the two in the middle will win the fight since they are allied
21	18 30 26 16 34 5 2 29 28 20	This narrow room can fit a desk.
21	33 29 2 15 24 17 11 16 9 14	Racing a tractor seems like a waste of time
21	22 26 10 11 20 35 19 7 18 34	Looks like he's in the upper deck, maybe section 42.
21	10 18 1 33 7 8 11 31 14 9	The house looks very old.
21	16 25 12 30 2 35 22 1 19 18	This plane is the right size to be able to land in this spot.
21	20 1 7 5 30 25 10 26 35 28	i bet it would make a good tree house
21	8 31 24 4 13 26 19 22 28 30	Cars were built to last back in the day
21	13 14 19 16 6 32 22 12 18 27	I would use logic in figuring this out.
21	32 9 5 31 3 22 27 26 35 19	these flowers won't bloom all year
21	20 34 25 10 30 29 28 24 12 1	Skiing down the slope it's imperative to avoid obstructions in the snow otherwise your likelihood of tripping increases exponentially.
21	30 27 34 8 7 23 15 33 9 24	If I remember correctly, this screen appears first and then the Finder window second.
21	9 27 32 16 11 8 18 17 3 20	Those look like they're about to fall...
21	17 7 6 32 30 35 26 15 14 4	It looks somewhat like a tablet screen, but I believe it is a window.
21	22 5 26 15 17 3 27 19 30 24	RAND PAUL IS SMART BUT VERY ANNOYING
21	27 13 22 16 4 3 31 10 6 26	There are most likely several power sources for that
21	4 7 12 10 2 32 18 23 15 8	This could be more efficient for the obviously left-handed user.
21	29 16 8 11 2 14 32 34 24 6	This is not an environment conductive to actual learning.
21	26 22 3 24 17 10 15 11 5 33	That tattoo took an amazing artist to accomplish.
21	16 34 1 7 18 33 25 31 35 5	Ah yes, the arrivals exit of the airport.
21	8 23 4 3 22 19 5 2 9 20	That's a nice looking car but those gas prices...
21	17 33 7 13 16 5 31 14 25 8	He taped the rehearsal so he could use it as a teaching aid in the future.
21	15 24 6 10 13 20 30 2 7 32	Blue and cold really tell the weather in this picture.
21	32 25 35 26 5 1 13 23 34 18	This guy looks like he's having fun.
21	26 29 23 27 35 8 1 6 13 9	The runners will probably round that corner.
21	30 33 22 14 1 20 19 15 29 12	I would love to eat there, I know they have delicious food there.
21	34 25 26 12 19 23 28 24 27 2	The high school cross country team was having a race.
21	33 2 22 34 20 16 12 30 29 11	Soap might be a good thing if you have moss growing behind your ears.
21	12 16 2 4 31 15 26 5 25 9	The color seems like a mix between blue and green.
21	32 11 3 26 25 8 27 2 28 20	I can't already put together a few words in my mind just seeing these many pieces.
21	15 3 6 23 34 18 17 32 31 27	He could be smart because hes wearing glasses, but it does not mean he is.
21	19 12 26 4 35 1 22 17 3 34	This is powered by energy
21	31 4 19 14 20 26 22 27 32 8	we picked the best place for us to go
21	23 29 20 27 35 8 7 10 33 26	I wonder who he's married to
21	8 30 1 33 20 6 31 19 10 28	The girl is going to eat the food.
21	7 15 24 2 9 19 35 26 13 3	This photo has a very linear feel.
21	29 28 20 16 34 26 22 32 12 4	Yellow is the color of mustard
21	8 30 12 4 14 23 11 7 3 34	I just want to think this through thoroughly.
21	34 24 6 13 16 17 10 5 32 27	It is very unsafe for children to be sitting in the front seat.
21	15 7 9 14 27 23 13 5 35 8	Brown desert ground with peaks
21	29 17 30 25 1 34 14 33 32 23	the weather there looks nice and tropical
21	8 23 27 35 26 34 1 18 13 30	It is very obvious some people do not consider what their license plates will look like.
21	15 22 23 27 33 4 5 31 6 14	I hope there is a staircase to go down to the market.
21	23 24 14 9 34 25 6 16 8 5	This must be collected before the event
21	30 33 34 6 3 22 12 8 7 4	The money it cost to go there isn't that bad?
21	8 22 5 12 34 13 23 27 25 24	This looks like a well-organized event.
21	6 3 11 15 27 12 20 8 29 19	This must be in a foreign place.
21	20 13 33 9 30 23 34 12 18 32	An informal bar can be a good place to gather with good friends.
21	5 3 24 9 16 23 2 8 35 33	A lucid and awe inspiring mountain
21	1 17 35 20 19 16 10 27 14 26	A tree in a park
21	10 28 23 12 24 1 35 31 16 3	Tourists walking near a farm
21	7 1 8 30 16 22 32 34 25 17	A beach, filled with millions of pebbles of sand and the blue waters, which are actually clear!
21	13 28 9 11 34 30 19 10 29 31	I would also beat that man if he did that to me. He beat me up.
21	9 13 5 15 26 1 34 11 17 28	Those figures must be 3-4 inches tall based upon other object in the room
21	11 13 26 34 27 22 33 32 23 14	I suppose a door from below is better than a door from above.
21	30 28 20 16 1 32 8 14 11 9	Dolphins are too intelligent to be casually exploited.
21	1 22 20 33 10 7 29 17 16 30	If I were trapped here, I would eat the bark off the trees.
21	1 2 15 6 27 18 16 10 7 31	This system doesn't look very secure. What kind of safety measures do they have in place here?
21	23 20 14 28 10 24 27 25 11 15	I wonder what song she is singing, my guess is row, row, row your boat.
21	2 31 11 15 27 19 29 33 32 35	Based on the fact that there's an older gentleman and two younger people, I would assume that he is the father of at least one of them.
21	10 34 35 7 24 32 22 23 12 8	A broken clock is right twice a day.
21	24 25 33 23 9 35 22 13 16 11	This means it is that time of year again
21	2 29 20 30 27 10 12 6 24 9	The portryed gentlemen seem to be very wise.
21	14 7 35 1 25 3 6 4 12 2	The park trees were starting to bloom
21	23 2 16 28 18 25 29 17 15 33	I think that looks like a good meal.
21	17 12 25 23 28 16 5 1 4 26	The smart thing to do is put a shirt on your pet so they can be more recognizable in a crowd of people.
21	5 12 10 15 29 18 7 25 32 13	clearly the girl in front will win
21	4 33 22 10 31 27 26 12 5 8	the fireworks are too close to them
21	19 2 30 7 25 6 31 24 20 3	I'll have to find a good party for this.
21	20 24 23 7 19 5 6 35 30 33	Sail south with down winds
21	20 29 14 35 17 11 32 25 9 23	As you can see, this city relies on electricity.
21	30 18 2 19 17 22 7 12 9 6	The way the sauce sits on that meal is most appealing.
21	25 6 13 4 15 8 17 27 20 1	This picture would be much easier to view if it were rotated 90 degree clockwise.
21	30 18 7 34 32 15 27 10 4 20	Those people will need a tow truck.
21	30 16 8 1 23 24 10 11 18 25	I wonder how they drew that.
21	19 11 2 18 34 14 35 22 4 3	Reading the plack is so important to know what happened in the past everywhere.
21	26 17 1 30 24 23 16 13 32 9	The time it takes for him to contemplate this, his shot will be over
21	11 10 32 34 16 19 27 14 26 7	This bird knows to stay close to the shore.
21	33 8 16 1 3 34 28 5 9 12	I would take an autograph as well if I met them!
21	4 31 7 5 8 30 27 25 23 19	The architecture of the building must've been decades old
21	2 6 28 7 1 30 23 4 13 10	people are enjoying the day
21	26 23 25 19 7 18 31 5 24 8	i wonder how busy it gets at the leeds market?
21	22 4 29 26 27 10 9 13 3 6	This lamp would be sufficient for my lighting needs.
21	2 23 13 12 4 32 33 34 25 24	Appropriate attire for the cold weather.
21	17 15 33 35 32 29 31 2 12 13	I love how the letters are parallel, and of course everyone loves white frosting.
21	15 24 19 9 2 8 25 32 7 6	Looks like they could be part of a sorority with their matching outfits like that.
21	27 7 14 26 22 11 33 5 2 3	It makes sense that all these co-workers would be seen together in a photo.
21	23 34 28 9 27 14 31 1 22 13	of course she is using a fork
21	29 17 20 9 25 27 11 24 5 7	The best way to capture a photo is to ensure there's a high level of contrast, like this white bark against a black background.
21	22 8 31 30 19 26 1 15 14 5	Those shoes seem very sensible for walking around on a surface like that. They would be able to grip the pavement well with rubber soles.
21	35 23 20 5 28 33 19 13 14 15	Stand to the right, walk on the left.
21	31 16 30 17 13 33 26 35 8 18	The crackle in the glaze means this is an oil painting.
21	35 14 28 17 4 7 31 16 20 19	Well it only makes sense they would have this diagram
21	11 30 8 28 16 4 35 32 2 14	Next time they should all sit on the car, then we could actually see the people.
21	2 20 33 30 10 16 13 12 7 11	Seems like it going to rain. Did you bring an umbrella?
21	18 19 2 22 7 31 6 12 29 15	It would make sense to clear those steps.
21	35 12 1 7 29 34 15 10 26 3	I like the layout of the market.
21	24 11 6 2 28 18 34 17 26 8	There's a lot of math that is involved with playing an instrument like this.  Tempo, etc.
21	14 28 3 24 25 5 13 22 31 26	I hope they finish closing the drape before they start his haircut.
21	18 34 6 9 26 11 17 19 16 35	I bet it would cost a fortune to heat/cool.
21	17 6 15 9 13 22 34 1 27 24	this is the steering wheel and dash board of a car
21	11 22 20 9 24 17 5 14 10 16	Why have the vehicles so close to the water without any large fence?
21	5 32 11 25 18 30 35 15 20 4	Bricks/cement are more durable than wood, so of course they designed this with the wood motif on top.
21	13 11 30 23 12 22 31 27 28 15	It makes no sense to have a side car when no one is in it.
21	5 3 24 17 28 20 31 14 22 10	This must be some kind of event.
21	2 23 1 15 6 32 7 16 8 33	A quiet baby is a happy baby.
21	5 15 9 17 6 26 22 24 31 33	I need this cup because I love coffee and I'm a total nerd. It suits me well.
21	1 32 25 16 12 17 9 19 28 27	What he is saying makes sense.
21	35 26 25 2 12 6 16 22 18 4	Clearly they are talking about men and how horrible they are.
21	1 32 19 34 11 30 28 22 29 27	He should sit on the step.
21	1 10 12 23 34 27 11 9 17 30	That is a poor place to park to unload the van, they should move forward to avoid the light pole.
21	13 4 34 5 14 8 30 33 27 2	He's matched his t shirt to his lego mans trousers, nice!
21	13 25 23 33 10 7 12 5 4 9	the coeeficient of gravitational redaction is nullified by the velocity
21	30 5 29 14 32 27 3 12 11 25	i like to keep the road clear for traffic
21	15 27 30 4 1 20 26 25 11 29	He must have dropped his bottle!
21	12 27 29 28 20 15 18 10 25 31	Just a farmer wrangling cattle
21	31 12 17 8 35 11 24 16 9 13	That's a great looking park
21	12 24 3 10 8 25 22 16 32 2	The cathedral looks older than the buildings around it
21	18 15 27 13 6 32 17 31 2 23	It's cool how a picture captures everyday life.  This could be so many people right now.
21	32 27 17 18 25 35 28 16 3 34	It looks like they are going to eat dinner
21	3 1 19 17 24 13 34 27 11 29	I think this is a theme park
21	33 15 32 6 20 30 8 31 16 11	The mountain must be very sturdy to  be able hold a large mansion.
21	25 20 10 17 2 22 31 27 16 7	I'm sure there are many uses for this art.
21	27 26 33 20 17 29 30 11 6 13	In any sense of the word, this color is "mauve". Some may consider it a shade or red, some a shade of purple. Both are correct and yet both are wrong.
21	2 14 8 23 26 15 17 7 12 30	I don't see how that position works for him.
21	20 3 16 32 2 1 25 14 26 31	It looks like it'll rain soon there.
21	22 13 25 18 3 9 35 34 30 5	This is a close up of a Lego block
21	11 9 13 18 33 25 31 24 22 23	The flowers grow better in the ground than in a pot
21	6 2 12 11 19 34 29 20 22 9	this is where the dewey decimal system works
21	12 4 16 14 34 32 9 22 8 19	Those are definitely men who get paid for construction work.
21	30 33 20 16 4 28 6 2 14 12	Leaves like that are extremely heavy and often fall repeatedly. Most likely someone was reading under a tree and had this leaf fall on their book
21	9 4 30 22 24 3 18 5 35 31	That must be the award for the best coach.
21	33 8 25 3 10 31 11 28 16 32	This couldn't have been an intentional photo.
21	22 25 26 33 18 11 8 28 3 19	Glass bottles are better for the environment than plastic ones.
21	1 11 18 26 2 34 7 8 14 23	Obviously the green bean casserole is delicious because it followed the instructions to a T.
21	11 1 13 16 33 25 4 26 29 24	Another beautiful ending to another fulfilling day.
21	6 22 34 32 2 29 35 11 28 5	The flag is an American flag
21	34 8 30 4 26 35 22 25 3 5	Interesting place to visit on vacation while in a wheel chair. This quaint yet sprawling structure is not ADA compliant. Great pic though.
21	20 24 35 5 18 29 16 27 34 30	The sun is too bright in this shot.
21	9 20 29 8 12 5 26 23 18 33	The tower had a lot of stairs to get to the top.
21	3 1 26 27 28 19 17 13 32 29	If it is the newest version of the car, then yes, it is the “next” one.
21	18 13 7 8 5 32 19 11 28 24	Good thing she's all bundle up. She could get frostbite.
21	29 12 20 15 8 35 24 25 16 17	Realistically, the isle they are walking down is rather narrow. I think it would make more sense to widen the isle.
21	25 1 4 17 30 8 12 18 6 10	There are way too many people in this building.
21	33 16 12 31 27 10 23 13 6 4	It is interesting how repeating patterns can be found in nature.
21	34 29 9 4 1 28 11 6 13 19	The view is great, but its raining
21	31 26 14 17 28 2 35 16 1 6	Seems to me that the policeman is quite a professional and comfortable in his uniform looking at his posture.
21	1 3 11 22 2 14 13 9 10 17	Doesn't look like a very big space to play music!
21	18 17 15 25 5 4 31 27 24 1	I have no idea how he manages to do that.
21	16 17 15 1 30 25 33 22 6 32	Why would someone pay per day for internet?
21	2 24 29 11 31 7 33 1 3 14	I think they need very tall ladders to paint this ceiling
21	3 11 31 34 32 23 25 30 9 10	I cannot tell if this is a lamp post or an actual building.
21	17 2 32 10 15 27 28 25 33 12	I love the green of a baseball field.  Must be fake lol.
21	23 33 11 13 29 10 25 32 1 30	Looks like a futball game..?
21	18 26 34 19 32 23 9 2 27 7	This person isn't wearing a chef's coat. Therefore, he must not be the actual sushi chef.
21	32 23 7 12 34 24 33 3 4 10	He's a bit taller than her.
21	5 32 17 16 3 28 25 19 30 9	Think Ill put off my car wash until next week.
21	14 12 4 34 2 31 13 9 17 32	Look how large their smiles are. It's certain they will get engaged soon.
21	34 14 17 29 30 10 6 31 25 20	Ah the train, a perfect way to drive. No gas to be used, no worries.
21	28 33 10 2 18 9 1 31 35 14	Great pic of someone giving a speech.
21	12 34 31 29 7 9 8 35 27 13	He is cleaning himself before bed.
21	26 12 13 29 7 23 16 24 9 15	I think a vending machine across the street is very useful at night!
21	18 35 7 19 22 26 34 31 16 28	What looks like a rock at first glance, appears to be compressed pieces of trash.
21	19 6 14 20 25 12 29 7 34 35	this band is very popular.
21	6 28 27 4 14 11 7 10 13 22	A foul should be called against number 16 in blue. He is clearly interfering with the red player.
21	25 33 9 11 22 15 13 19 17 6	What a clear and concise display on how stars die.
21	35 30 33 31 3 24 2 1 25 12	It's obvious to me that this is a picture of a glacier between two tall mountains
21	15 9 10 30 35 20 32 34 11 3	This is a race car on a track, there are more than likely cars behind or in front of it
21	35 4 19 26 25 1 10 2 16 18	This must be some great tasting beer.
21	17 20 22 5 6 9 35 28 13 29	The woman is holding a cat and the little girl is petting it.
21	6 25 22 23 20 18 5 16 31 2	There is a pattern here.
21	15 28 16 3 6 34 1 19 30 18	There are 3 houses lined up.
21	6 33 31 4 30 25 22 9 23 28	I think it's dangerous to call a company inherently evil. That's not to say every action is perfect or moral, but at the same time, it's not to say every action is immoral either.
21	7 15 34 32 4 17 33 3 18 31	If you are pushing 80% of the time while being pulled 20% of the time in social media how long does it take to get your point across?
21	15 20 14 23 35 17 28 10 33 9	It appears these chairlifts are not operating, potentially down for repairs?
21	24 25 5 2 22 20 34 23 17 32	It is likely that this turtle is hundreds of years old.
21	5 4 18 23 35 8 14 33 28 12	It would be very difficult to make it too the center rocks without a boat.
21	31 18 13 6 22 19 2 12 17 24	She must be praying or something.
21	19 10 8 25 3 27 9 20 6 17	It looks like she's walking along a beach.
21	30 23 3 22 2 32 15 25 20 9	This is an elephant in a zoo.
21	6 4 34 20 11 13 27 1 7 19	I think this is a picture of food.
21	34 7 35 25 27 9 2 8 18 24	That wheel does not seem logistically useful
21	19 10 35 6 26 13 25 5 29 20	Those shirts will make him sweat.
21	33 34 14 23 11 25 16 13 12 19	She must be a teacher or educator.
21	7 6 31 9 3 20 11 29 33 19	I love keeping up with the game stats. I won 6 quid just because I took time to look at the data.
21	12 32 31 24 17 18 3 34 13 16	This is a heavy duty tool.
21	27 2 13 30 34 24 15 32 7 19	How did that get up there?
21	16 34 28 22 12 25 1 18 30 9	The weather was below freezing as indicated by the frozen pond and accumulated snow.
21	5 7 4 33 3 16 13 25 1 29	This is a picture of a bird, of course!
21	5 12 7 26 16 32 14 27 13 8	If you touch the base your safe.  If you don't you're not safe.
21	25 34 20 23 31 13 27 26 35 19	I am unsure what he is pointing at but he certainly has gotten himself in an interesting position
21	7 23 14 19 13 10 16 35 29 1	This is a well documented day.
21	14 20 23 1 28 11 32 8 33 19	LOOKS CLOUDY AT THE RACE TRACK
21	17 18 10 20 15 28 34 32 30 6	I am looking into identification resources to know where she is exactly.
21	24 28 22 23 31 13 20 10 34 7	This bridge is very useful!
21	28 17 33 35 18 30 27 15 5 13	She appears to be quite happy.
21	28 7 13 15 35 29 25 26 1 5	What time does it start?
21	28 35 22 32 16 29 2 26 9 3	This lion might have been knocked out for the sake of examination.
21	15 7 19 24 28 20 35 23 27 18	That's an efficient use of space.
21	8 7 19 24 11 18 27 31 12 35	The movie should still be open because the sign is on.
21	14 18 4 22 33 16 25 15 5 20	Ok grand ma up front!
21	16 9 10 28 25 33 26 24 27 1	They are most likely celebrating something special.
21	14 10 9 32 35 23 12 22 4 6	If she leaves the guitar on the ground too much, it will get leaves and other things in it, which will make it harder to play.
21	10 30 8 34 3 13 20 28 31 29	That woman is getting her makeup done
21	13 2 19 16 35 4 22 25 23 12	Science inspires scientists to design beautiful prototypes like this.
21	3 17 27 19 5 16 26 9 20 25	I see he is playing fetch, returning to his owner, stick in tow!
21	2 6 32 22 12 25 28 24 14 34	Am not sure I get the whole structure in this
21	32 20 14 6 7 27 29 26 11 2	Looks to be a team photo.
21	10 34 7 4 8 29 12 1 31 33	It's a picture of a windmill without the complete fan.
21	18 10 9 13 34 2 3 28 30 23	Taking a picture through glass never works.
21	5 34 1 3 8 6 35 23 13 15	the picture is relevantly dark and plain.
21	29 32 4 11 12 20 34 25 26 35	I don't think this location would work for what I want because I want easier beach access.
21	35 32 16 20 28 29 3 9 1 15	Clearly taken in a country with decent infrastructure.
21	32 10 27 14 12 5 11 17 2 35	It must have taken some time to coordinate the design.
21	27 29 13 25 1 7 3 30 24 16	The band has been together for many years.
21	8 28 20 12 13 5 23 1 27 35	I hope that he doesn't get hurt jumping off the couch like that.
21	7 22 3 26 29 2 18 13 9 12	The water must be contaminated.
21	19 9 20 31 2 18 32 6 15 17	A consistent view like this must cost a fortune
21	22 31 27 13 2 7 28 14 26 16	if he sat up he'd be more comfortable
21	15 23 7 22 10 17 31 6 35 12	If we have 40 people and 39 quiches, someone will leave hungry.
21	18 15 23 11 13 35 33 28 16 14	Stone was the best material for a tower back then
21	33 23 34 28 25 7 3 10 32 5	The red roof makes the rest of the building pop out.
21	6 19 26 2 27 24 7 28 11 33	Can't wait to watch the show at Radio City! going to take the subway into the city.
21	19 35 6 18 11 34 20 10 31 17	It appears this girl may need braces.
21	19 3 7 15 11 24 20 31 35 32	Talk to the hand...I'm trying to rest.
21	12 7 27 17 31 9 1 10 8 3	Some sort of bug specimen it would appear.
21	20 16 2 15 29 5 27 25 7 18	They are looking at phones.
21	2 25 1 19 10 22 14 26 6 17	You know, if I was a cactus, I would want to be all prickly and painful too. Because if I had to live in a climate that barely had any rainwater, I wouldn't want some animal trying to get at the water already inside me, so I would try to grow some ouchy thorns to deter them.
21	30 5 4 27 31 35 16 22 18 23	Those food stuffs might be organized better.
21	2 10 13 8 4 31 17 23 1 28	Well that doesn't look like a nice image...
21	32 35 28 12 34 9 23 8 3 26	It's a line of children dancing.
21	5 28 8 22 27 2 17 3 30 7	It's a big ball in an empty area surrounded by trees.
21	16 12 2 35 6 29 1 27 14 7	Communication is the key to a long distance relationship.
21	20 4 18 23 8 12 15 6 27 14	a gap in the center of the map isnt very functional
21	19 31 5 20 34 16 24 33 22 14	Share your food you won’t eat all this
21	11 8 26 27 1 31 34 18 17 24	All these cats look similar, they must be related
21	25 16 33 13 15 26 29 18 34 1	Those cyclists look very focused on their speed and strategical movements.
21	3 34 18 4 19 5 31 1 11 22	I'm assuming these two are siblings. Is the elder one on the left?
21	32 20 17 22 25 26 3 15 4 33	To be or not to be, that is the question.
21	22 16 6 29 12 19 13 33 2 31	Is this posted on Youtube anywhere? Would love to watch
21	7 29 26 11 4 9 24 23 14 15	Clear skies and clear waters always leaves a person happy.
21	7 23 34 4 8 28 2 29 15 32	This building was designed with such precision. Even if you are not religious, you can appreciate the architecture and engineering.
21	31 35 23 18 14 17 25 34 2 22	I think that is black.
21	8 27 16 19 9 10 32 11 26 4	it looks like they are going fast by the motion blur
21	10 5 33 8 15 2 22 34 18 14	Although inviting, going into doors without permission invites the owner to shoot you. It's best to respect personal space.
21	5 34 25 12 13 3 20 22 10 9	Such fascinating cantilever construction on that walkway!
21	20 9 30 19 24 7 8 16 32 23	The pattern of water going back out to the sea.
21	8 19 10 12 28 26 6 27 20 17	I'm cool as a cucumber.
21	29 18 24 11 1 32 6 30 3 25	They better get moving before it starts raining
21	9 23 11 22 7 27 12 24 3 8	of course the shadows are going to fall in such a way due to the sun overhead
21	19 18 25 29 30 35 32 2 20 8	it snowed from the east, water looks cold
21	19 18 14 30 7 6 20 31 15 3	Looks like they are doing a sound check.
21	19 32 4 6 10 24 2 29 26 25	If we all take care of our enviironment, the world would be a better place.
21	3 25 16 7 30 8 20 14 17 4	Buckle up for safety! Make sure you aren't on a main road.
21	19 2 18 33 3 10 1 11 16 25	He really needs to watch his fingers
21	20 12 4 14 15 27 7 10 28 3	There is a chance they can hit 10 pins here.
21	20 7 8 28 29 12 3 6 4 25	I believe he may be at Kayaking place.
21	19 1 2 6 24 33 27 15 3 22	He seems to be running through the flags?
21	10 4 17 25 35 16 19 3 24 1	There is a nice bridge.
21	27 18 28 10 13 12 32 19 34 8	Seems like a little live performance.
21	15 33 1 20 29 30 24 35 7 4	This must be a night market.
21	24 32 17 35 15 31 14 2 25 1	These color masks are really well achieved.
21	20 25 24 33 35 30 32 6 4 29	As the waves erode the mountain side I wonder how the citizens will maintain the homes.
21	8 20 25 15 11 13 29 16 18 22	The kids need to be in line.
21	8 2 16 18 19 29 9 24 14 13	This should be moved in case of danger.
21	26 12 35 29 23 20 2 13 10 22	Drinking wine out of wine glasses, makes sense.
21	11 16 8 35 22 3 23 31 15 20	Is it smart to build a structure where it appears electricity will be hard to come by?
21	34 10 15 2 12 14 7 5 29 8	The engine should be in the tank.
21	18 28 10 32 31 25 11 13 17 12	That is a well thought out space saving design.
21	12 23 11 13 26 4 7 8 1 24	I cant logically figure out what city this could be.
21	15 13 8 23 22 1 5 24 26 19	That bezel is too big.
21	19 20 18 22 7 25 30 31 32 9	She needs to touch home plate.
21	31 8 27 2 9 11 30 18 17 22	Rocks like these can help identify the era fossils found there came from.
21	17 8 14 15 4 24 1 16 7 23	This reminds me of the Alien movie for some odd reason...
21	11 16 4 6 7 34 26 22 1 5	She is definitely not in it for love.
21	1 2 10 13 31 4 35 30 3 32	She must use that sword to threaten those who dislike her hair choices.
21	20 18 35 14 3 9 31 32 12 15	It is a foot xray.
21	30 1 14 4 7 13 12 28 19 11	I have never understood the purpose of spires on skyscrapers.
21	2 33 14 13 22 15 32 17 5 18	That car is a very affordable choice.
21	20 19 12 28 27 16 26 15 14 18	Okay, so last one to put their left foot in has to buy the Beer.
21	29 3 1 23 34 9 16 35 4 20	Very interesting that the artist chose to put the subject near the end of the perception point.
21	17 14 26 8 35 11 33 9 6 13	The yellow beams are for support.
21	22 16 31 2 8 24 20 23 12 18	Looks like this building is under construction.
21	28 33 34 15 4 35 30 18 13 12	The color palette is perfect for the Christmas season.
21	10 3 23 16 7 24 8 11 17 1	The sky looks as if it may be a good time to get off of the water.
21	35 7 1 4 10 11 2 31 26 32	Looks very heavy and industrial.
21	23 1 27 22 10 15 2 9 6 28	These thorns look sharp and very imposing. It would be common sense to avoid touching them.
21	23 15 33 35 16 6 17 28 2 1	The organization on there is downright pleasing
21	34 29 9 27 19 26 7 6 25 30	Wonder how many gallons per minute that waterfall expels.
21	26 17 32 5 20 10 3 14 12 6	Seeing a plane so low makes me question the exact speeds and time this plane has had liftoff.
21	30 8 32 6 15 29 35 28 12 1	That's a great looking sunset.
21	15 28 23 5 32 27 30 17 11 29	Takes a lot of dedication
21	7 12 10 3 22 32 5 14 18 4	From the lines and creases at the top, this appears to be a drawing or a print rather than a photo.
21	3 7 24 6 19 8 5 25 4 23	These would be visually pleasing for a child.
21	9 29 1 23 11 5 14 16 17 18	The shower head is not optimal
21	6 30 19 11 28 10 14 35 20 13	art is all about linear flow of the feelings in the body
21	22 1 31 3 15 18 19 30 16 29	This flower is white, and stands out among the green leaves.
21	14 16 2 30 10 12 24 18 9 22	The colors of the scarf should have been put in the correct order starting with red.
21	13 32 34 7 31 20 4 9 26 33	Riding a bike around a city makes sense to save on gas money and get exercise.
21	26 20 29 19 9 31 14 33 27 1	Her dress was probably made by hand.
21	20 19 28 27 16 3 22 14 26 10	This stove was used to heat early change of the century homes.
21	4 28 3 33 2 31 26 11 1 7	He needs a good haircut.
21	1 27 8 26 2 12 30 19 7 14	A lot of men must golf here.
21	3 19 22 4 13 8 14 15 17 9	This building is a piece of geometric precision.
21	3 34 12 8 31 7 25 22 9 24	LPs have the most clear sound.
21	2 23 32 1 34 13 11 6 22 16	This sign is missing information that would make it make clear sense.
21	10 33 31 1 32 17 15 11 5 12	I would guess that this is roller derby, but doesn't that sport use tilted track?
21	26 5 32 16 17 2 33 28 3 24	A picture by a fountain is always nice.
21	33 3 23 14 25 5 10 15 22 2	Yes, this singer and guitar player go good together like chips and dip.
21	25 18 2 35 14 7 24 34 1 26	Won't the dog just slip down the ramp?
21	19 23 13 18 31 12 28 4 10 9	I really do not think a motorcycle is the optimal form of transport for a bride and groom.
21	34 24 19 15 25 31 10 27 29 14	Boy was the competition worth it.
21	35 22 20 26 2 15 3 25 13 17	The mouse is looking for food
21	27 19 15 23 17 25 35 8 3 26	That car would be very expensive to purchase
21	15 30 1 35 12 22 8 23 18 14	If I only could read french
21	32 33 28 15 17 25 2 24 23 7	Looks like it may be poisonous
21	11 1 6 19 23 20 22 25 18 8	Well since the stained glass windows were already here when they purchased the building, of course they kept them and made them a focal point of the store ambiance.
21	34 27 20 11 13 35 19 25 14 26	Seems like a hard place to find parking sometimes.
21	28 15 27 24 31 34 10 26 29 12	A road with fields behind and a mountain farther back.
21	11 33 12 10 25 13 32 17 20 27	A man marching towards a dress.
21	20 18 11 4 31 10 26 24 3 7	I makes sense to park there.
21	24 26 29 15 27 33 7 19 22 14	Building it there will leave dusty residue.
21	10 28 26 29 19 14 20 4 16 5	This must be his motorcycle.
21	22 30 10 14 26 17 35 5 3 18	People may see him, but he better be able to yell to get his point across.
21	11 14 12 23 13 7 35 25 32 10	the monument is equidistant to the right abgles of the building
21	7 24 34 16 3 33 10 14 2 18	Of course these historical landmarks would be eroded. They have been there for thousands of years, but nonetheless a great staple of history.
21	1 28 9 35 4 25 30 14 8 2	I imagine that is would take a long time for me to learn this language.
21	12 19 7 1 29 31 24 10 2 9	If we want to find beauty, we only need to know where to look.
21	20 24 5 25 28 1 19 6 27 9	This sand will melt at the first sign of storm.
21	13 22 14 23 25 2 27 19 3 16	which line is the fastest
21	24 33 25 22 30 27 18 9 31 34	These bridges are the best way to handle traffic in the city
22	5 23 8 25 26 15 21 9 27 17	I thought the water fall made me laugh
22	15 28 8 20 9 16 29 7 17 21	Is this a drug deal?
22	32 12 20 9 16 7 2 4 28 3	Anyone got a place to stay? Looks like my new house needs some repairs.
22	3 21 25 24 14 15 12 20 7 34	Weed are the champions, weed are the champions of the world!

22	35 16 23 12 26 24 28 15 14 2	The slant and pitch looks very odd and yet it doesnt want to be distorted
22	32 24 29 18 21 2 26 19 25 13	Well I guess that was the easy way out
22	35 9 4 5 33 25 31 18 27 24	I find the signature at the bottom funny.
22	10 3 1 24 12 20 7 5 6 15	The metal statue looked as confused as I.
22	7 15 14 12 33 8 4 6 27 28	She finds something to be funny.
22	19 4 14 1 3 15 26 28 21 5	This is the face you make when you have a sithis is the face you make when you let one rip and are teying to let somene else take the blame
22	32 2 11 28 18 30 6 19 27 15	Haha, why is he dressed as if it were forty years ago?
22	28 1 7 27 12 29 25 6 14 26	guess the machine was busted
22	31 14 11 15 24 2 4 9 32 26	Looks like someone needs a laugh break!

22	1 23 35 19 26 24 20 5 28 25	How about a soccer game at the small open ground at the foot of the mountains! That'd make for a fun event during a hike.

22	6 34 19 18 35 11 25 31 33 27	I'm thinking this picture is toast.
22	18 9 12 3 10 33 29 27 6 4	I'm not so sure I'd want to fly in that now.

22	21 24 30 12 29 28 14 33 19 6	Some call that a forest, but I think it's kind of sparse...more like a two-est!
22	14 18 25 31 8 32 28 29 11 19	Red on yellow, wish I could read it!
22	26 14 17 25 19 27 35 34 11 13	That river is o big you could build a house on it/

22	6 25 5 7 23 15 28 9 29 2	This hotel better be good after the hike through the forest to get here
22	15 5 9 23 12 1 32 31 16 28	We almost got wet by the waves.
22	21 29 23 1 6 24 9 14 26 34	I think that building would be great to play limbo with.
22	35 8 20 28 13 10 15 34 6 21	Is this a doll or a pixar movie screen shot?
22	1 18 10 17 8 9 3 35 13 30	I don't think he can really push that bus out of the way
22	31 33 9 19 3 29 6 32 5 35	The puppies were hiding after getting in the garbage
22	33 24 19 30 10 32 27 16 31 20	It doesn't even look like thy are singing the same song.
22	19 13 24 25 4 18 12 8 20 32	And here we have an ancient table and chairs!
22	24 25 28 2 8 32 20 34 11 33	Little kids draw the cutest things.
22	35 30 33 18 29 8 31 25 20 1	Are those offices or townhomes with skylights in the basement?
22	16 21 32 24 8 18 14 19 9 11	Well, looks like the party might have been cancelled, or everyone just retracted their invite.
22	4 30 12 32 11 20 29 19 16 21	I think someone's straight edge might have been bent when building this.
22	21 17 12 34 24 20 13 18 35 5	What ran out of marble?
22	34 30 2 9 3 16 29 28 25 18	That's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
22	30 7 27 16 21 2 4 23 14 25	I hope those trophies last a long time!
22	14 7 28 31 8 29 26 25 6 10	That one guy is looking at the pole! lol

22	32 31 24 25 7 6 35 30 27 5	The ceiling looks like a giant ice cube tray
22	21 34 1 11 20 13 18 9 31 19	We're up to some mischief at the big game.
22	27 7 3 30 4 28 23 14 21 9	Got some loose hairs on those balls.
22	21 27 11 28 7 30 15 33 16 24	oh, oh, which way? which way!don't drop the ball!
22	29 28 8 1 3 17 2 15 35 16	Looks like his vest is growing tumors on the front, haha.

22	15 1 9 10 30 18 6 32 2 24	this dude be rolling up
22	21 18 15 1 5 4 25 34 6 28	The kayaker laughed as he saw the rapids up ahead. "Oh boy," he thought to himself!
22	11 29 7 5 3 2 25 9 15 28	Warning, may not see city through smog
22	6 24 18 9 29 17 1 28 30 5	Hahaha are they laughing at my funny jokes?
22	1 6 13 14 3 17 26 24 19 35	the chef's special of "whatever is left in the fridge"
22	23 15 20 25 2 21 1 12 4 24	I love to see when snowboarders wipe out.  It makes me laugh.
22	35 21 19 13 11 34 5 12 1 3	Independent doggo taking himself for stroll.
22	29 34 9 25 24 30 3 35 32 13	That might fall and melt the street.
22	24 20 4 28 6 26 3 8 25 15	Why is he just standing there? Get the ball!
22	2 14 5 17 18 33 27 15 7 28	I need to cheer her up.

22	28 1 14 30 31 9 35 34 16 6	When you come here you feel like royalty, then you check your bank account and realize you just a commoner.
22	17 23 3 19 2 28 16 13 21 1	This is super old school decor!
22	1 7 4 16 15 19 20 8 34 23	These birds are all flying around each other and attacking each other! It's hilarious!
22	20 24 19 25 23 8 26 1 30 27	Watch out for the train!
22	26 5 30 25 20 18 4 34 17 29	It must of been quite the birthday cake.
22	7 1 17 9 20 33 19 30 10 13	I'd like a whiskey please, on the rocks!
22	28 35 18 25 3 12 31 21 34 2	The color mauve makes me in a really good mood.
22	8 3 7 26 13 18 12 17 6 20	His mustache hair matches his side burns.
22	17 13 35 14 34 19 16 24 23 29	What a cute looking pupper
22	28 33 32 34 19 26 18 8 27 23	Too bad the robot can't do the walking for me.
22	26 2 27 30 3 16 5 6 35 25	That church is kind of giving me the creeps!
22	32 18 2 9 3 13 15 11 14 6	The jacket is too small for him.
22	10 27 2 16 9 7 11 15 3 30	The unicorns make me laugh.
22	32 25 3 29 18 19 4 1 17 28	I would be funny if the baby started crying.
22	5 3 16 4 27 19 34 30 17 28	What is this, a center for ants?
23	10 26 32 11 27 6 31 19 13 4	Gosh I wish I looked that happy
23	27 21 30 31 4 29 25 9 12 5	I don't even know what this thing is, not that I care about anything anyway.
23	10 4 1 5 22 19 8 32 9 31	I will never get married like these two.
23	33 2 5 26 12 13 11 27 34 24	I like that they're wearing shorts.
23	2 10 29 16 14 25 13 18 34 1	I can't stand when people make faces like that while playing instruments.
23	6 27 9 25 14 15 22 2 11 30	Being seasick on this boat was not a pretty sight.
23	24 4 27 21 18 30 26 31 5 19	I would hate everything about being in this position.
23	16 8 13 31 33 19 10 28 30 7	They look tired in the picture
23	14 21 27 15 1 35 10 20 19 34	we had an awful time on this trip
23	5 15 21 1 30 19 31 6 9 34	Its never going to change
23	27 17 30 19 25 32 20 8 34 4	I had that high score for a whole year. Now I'm down to my last life, on my last token.
23	4 25 1 27 6 19 22 9 28 21	Woudn't it be nice to live there in a dark room foreever?
23	26 22 30 11 4 3 34 19 17 21	It's a shame he's out there all alone.
23	3 30 24 17 11 6 19 18 2 25	I dont understand how people can throw money for parties
23	5 16 12 17 32 7 25 8 29 10	Ugh, I regret coming to the zoo. We are going to be walking all day and I bet my feet will hurt and most of the animals will be sleeping anyway.
23	9 18 10 22 31 8 19 33 1 26	These people were supposed to be my friends
23	28 10 3 22 8 16 17 14 31 15	That stuff is miserable, and I feel miserable just looking at this.
23	17 20 11 1 35 3 9 19 13 6	There is absolutely nothing here to get interested in.
23	29 19 27 10 30 12 8 7 4 22	These flowers give mee the worse migraine
23	2 8 26 28 18 3 1 14 29 4	This light reminds me of my life. A light trapped in a dark box.
23	21 20 15 10 32 34 12 35 1 4	The bird looks bored and unhappy.
23	34 27 12 15 30 35 6 31 32 20	At least they have friends
23	5 34 27 24 21 6 2 28 25 18	That puppy is the opposite of miserable! He's outside with his human.
23	14 13 17 35 28 27 22 34 6 11	There aren't even any clowns or people dressed as giant mice at this park.
23	30 22 6 20 27 9 28 15 24 31	This song makes me want to cry.
23	20 12 6 31 21 18 1 17 28 7	everything in there is so weird
23	2 30 22 19 10 4 15 1 12 29	Ugh, gambling, another chance for me to lose all my money
23	14 25 13 9 2 22 31 28 35 4	I wish I had love like this.
23	34 4 21 22 26 7 27 19 28 5	This is as disorganized as my life.
23	35 19 21 32 6 11 33 1 7 22	Wish i can jump in there
23	5 1 24 4 11 7 30 8 9 18	WHy do people just their bikes wherever the hell they want?
23	1 35 33 11 32 8 25 30 6 15	These awful animals are just sadly following each other in a boring line.
23	11 27 2 7 34 33 22 19 4 35	I just want to drown but the water is too shallow
23	34 28 16 29 3 10 11 32 13 33	I am so upset by this.
23	18 31 20 16 6 32 13 24 9 2	i wish i were at home
23	10 16 7 11 19 5 34 28 15 35	I do not want to be here
23	25 19 11 1 18 35 14 8 34 5	There was nothing happy about the sky.
23	35 16 32 33 12 21 30 13 5 11	You can tell by the beard and glasses that this guy is hiding something
23	27 19 17 2 6 12 22 13 8 5	There's just nothing in here, just like there's nothing in my life
23	29 4 33 10 24 31 14 6 8 15	i can feel the cold air
23	3 15 13 24 1 25 30 6 32 34	HERE COMES THE BIG TRAIN TO THE HARRY POTTER LAND.
23	29 21 6 13 4 12 25 18 30 31	Too tired and too hot outside
23	26 22 12 1 30 18 20 34 10 15	Wish I could get out and have fun like these guys, but I don't care enough to leave the house.
23	10 17 19 28 5 16 29 3 24 8	That place just makes me think of how hot and thirsty I would be.
23	15 9 14 26 30 4 28 32 35 10	Wow could the scenery get any more bland
23	10 27 18 15 20 3 24 9 5 26	Great, here comes the rain yet again.
23	18 21 34 33 20 2 25 14 9 15	Being in this old underground castle makes me sick and it smell so bad in here
23	10 26 31 12 11 34 9 30 29 27	Ugh-everyone looks so hot, and the tents look like ovens.
23	3 20 14 9 10 1 7 12 33 26	This is a terrible face painting.
23	33 22 1 25 14 4 3 21 35 15	Living here must've been uncomfortable
23	29 25 31 22 9 19 20 26 35 27	This reminds me of my life

23	3 14 1 7 8 19 6 11 28 29	They don't know what they're doing here.
23	22 6 29 34 33 27 4 5 20 3	Ugh, how drab and dark and too much walking on this long peer.
23	13 22 28 14 2 20 10 26 29 33	I'd hate to work here
23	35 22 20 25 4 24 33 30 14 9	They look like they want the parade to end and so do I.
23	12 17 13 8 22 34 29 9 1 7	ughh..  This just looks dark and dreary not a great photo
23	35 5 7 16 15 31 11 21 26 22	God i am absolutely depressed. This image is so dark color wise it only makes me sadder.
23	17 2 25 34 33 26 15 29 21 14	This photo is so gloomy, just like my life.
23	34 31 29 22 28 27 13 25 17 30	I dont know why anyone would want to play hockey, the ice is so cold.
23	34 9 27 7 18 19 3 16 1 2	I am not in a racing mood!
23	2 26 31 34 27 29 18 10 35 33	The beach just makes me sad
23	28 6 19 32 15 16 12 34 25 14	The boy really wants to get onto the field again. It just isn't fair.
23	33 16 11 34 31 8 10 32 3 12	It is so hard for me to watch boxing, even just looking at picture makes me cringe.
23	5 1 27 33 28 16 6 30 22 4	I wish I was here instead of this rainy dump I call home.
23	16 19 32 1 22 21 4 5 13 11	ugh, why am i looking at this
23	31 8 14 33 26 9 35 30 32 16	THE KING APPEARS TO BE IN LABOR PAIN.
23	4 34 17 16 7 25 19 2 26 15	The sludge, the slime, we're all doomed.
23	21 26 8 28 19 15 32 7 9 5	I hate this photo and everything about it.
23	4 9 31 12 3 10 14 20 33 13	The lights are giving me a headache
23	34 24 18 27 28 29 33 21 26 3	I will like to get drowned here
23	28 5 2 32 8 16 27 6 14 20	That looks so cold and gross. I would never swim there.
23	14 22 26 24 15 33 11 30 34 35	This scene is way too bright for me. That girl doesn't look too happy either, what a bore.
23	35 25 9 15 16 29 10 5 11 20	I don't understand work like this, it is like pulling teeth for me to try to get it.
23	31 6 25 21 34 20 11 4 13 35	all at this into not I'm Oh
23	22 5 7 32 14 13 24 16 8 29	THIS CAR IS AWESOME BUT THE NOTE WILL KILL YOU.
23	6 18 12 8 27 2 15 30 34 32	What a lemon, would never buy again!
23	21 15 5 6 8 25 3 33 18 9	I remember when I used to be able to run like that.  I hope it rains soon, so that this get canceled.
23	13 27 33 21 6 17 24 19 29 9	I can't imagine it would be much fun to go to this place.
23	3 24 19 8 17 13 35 6 2 33	I really am disappointed and sad that you can’t even see their face.
23	27 33 32 13 29 22 3 9 21 24	My love life is like this tree, dying.
23	22 10 29 6 9 34 21 19 7 24	I wish I could go to a cool sporting event
23	3 5 4 33 30 28 9 35 32 21	I bet she doesn't get much candy.
23	17 13 6 25 16 29 22 34 27 2	I need a bomb here
23	5 33 12 1 30 22 2 3 11 4	The mother duck and her babies look cold and hungry in the water.
23	7 5 26 30 9 16 24 15 2 17	I think these people are having too much fun!
23	5 26 32 30 22 2 20 9 33 35	That poor horse why does it have to do that.
23	10 13 17 35 28 6 21 3 15 24	Why does the Christmas tree look so fragile?
23	31 21 30 10 8 27 9 22 32 2	I knew listening to her sing was a bad idea
23	17 16 18 5 34 21 2 31 20 13	There is so much to ask forgiveness for. I need more than one rosary.
23	13 2 11 33 19 4 5 10 27 31	Looks like they are not pleased with their meal! I bet it tastes even worse than it looks.
23	3 19 7 32 11 24 35 12 29 2	It's sad when people look old to me and I find out I am the same age.
23	17 6 33 28 10 22 29 9 32 34	i have the worse neighbors
23	33 31 6 25 24 15 35 2 26 1	i wish i had a house like that
23	34 26 12 22 16 5 30 24 9 8	Oh, this has got to be the worst vacation stop EVER!
23	29 14 34 19 8 12 16 9 27 31	I wonder when women are going to realize that they will never get respect dressing this way.
23	8 21 16 30 2 9 33 29 32 18	Is it rotten? I feel rotten.
23	16 7 12 28 25 35 11 13 10 6	Noisy crowds at night give me migraines.
23	4 32 1 7 9 19 17 3 21 31	Paradise is the opposite of this place
23	18 11 10 13 22 24 33 16 31 5	It's such a gloomy day. Nice day to stay inside
23	27 6 9 24 17 30 25 14 26 21	the environment looks very lively although the wood looks miserable looking
23	27 7 32 26 22 24 6 30 10 3	I wish I was home watching "Empire".
23	18 17 29 22 11 5 21 31 1 33	I'm stuck inside once again and couldn't go to the race, nothing ever works for me
23	9 35 34 18 3 16 13 5 6 11	That girl hidden small thing in is hand
23	3 2 21 26 9 17 34 15 10 1	I just wasn't in to this, I had such a miserable time.
23	26 31 27 4 13 33 21 1 20 25	The two people on the right look like they are hating life just like I would be if I were them.
23	27 17 5 10 33 29 12 24 14 6	My god that duck looks like it is in pain.
23	6 3 16 35 5 4 26 25 11 27	They look like rodents and really dislike them.
23	10 6 35 32 12 18 20 19 25 24	What a stupid color. Actually this whole picture is stupid.
23	9 27 10 2 12 35 19 24 5 3	This poor dog, please get him inside before he dies of heat stroke.
23	12 34 4 14 13 21 32 6 16 17	this reminds me of my fish that just died
23	16 34 14 33 24 26 8 7 15 4	Taking pictures is so boring, why does this guy choose to do it.
23	28 35 1 3 32 11 31 7 29 27	He looks fat and ugly
23	6 9 32 3 11 26 28 31 13 8	The kites look kind of despairing in their flight
23	11 7 25 4 12 17 5 28 19 9	This image is so sad. The soldier is leaving behind his family and going off to war. I'm crying just thinking about it.
23	34 33 24 12 8 29 21 14 25 10	That guy looks like he's high on drugs.
23	11 14 12 33 27 32 9 21 20 35	Me when my brother eats the last piece of cake.
23	19 29 12 15 24 31 21 30 3 11	I would never want to sit under a big industrial fan like that. It is probably noisy, clanky, and would make me too cold.
23	26 10 18 1 24 4 13 5 11 25	The water was contaminated with pollution.  I remember when it was beautiful.
23	26 2 33 11 18 32 35 6 28 5	This gives me anxiety attacks thinking of all the IRS and hospital bills I get.
23	21 24 10 7 27 6 13 17 34 35	No one is around. Experience is dull.
23	8 16 15 1 31 30 33 6 4 18	I am so homesick for this city. I hate where I live now.
23	18 1 27 35 30 15 26 9 32 31	Ah crap, not her again.
23	2 14 11 7 16 4 22 32 24 15	This picture is stupid and it annoys me.
23	1 15 5 28 16 34 32 10 19 21	Don't they have any stools with wheels, I bet their knees hurt.
23	35 21 13 3 5 8 15 27 22 31	This music is boring. Why am I here.
23	1 6 5 31 11 9 32 21 30 19	No one wanted to be there, it was to hot.
23	16 10 13 22 34 8 14 21 12 3	He looks as depressed as I'd probably feel listening to him
23	11 12 17 35 22 16 9 28 3 8	I miss being a kid so much.
23	30 18 12 35 33 3 1 6 11 4	This old home is one for the history books
23	9 32 2 31 15 25 13 35 7 24	I'm sure that was a tiring climb to reach that location..
23	6 25 1 4 26 3 21 34 19 8	I can't understand anyone here.
23	1 25 3 9 33 16 21 28 34 22	She looks like she's going to dump him soon. This relationship is fake.
23	3 22 34 28 15 10 32 9 4 5	The teams performance summed up in one picture.
23	26 14 1 11 6 16 30 2 4 17	Kids are always getting in the way!
23	14 17 10 35 7 20 6 24 26 29	I hate the feel of the lights, I hate looking at eye sores I hate everything.
23	24 17 9 28 35 32 34 2 4 33	Sadly, people continue to destroy the sides of buildings with their thoughtless trashy graffiti.
23	26 31 21 27 11 15 20 9 30 3	How terrible to be fat and wet all the time?
23	7 34 10 27 4 13 32 26 16 22	Even this kid has a car, but I cannot afford one...
23	20 30 26 24 22 16 25 33 17 29	If I have to look at one more blonde in a blue dress...
23	3 27 34 20 4 1 18 9 25 28	He looks just like my old boyfriend who broke up with me last year. I'm going to try and call him again, but I've called him, like, a million times and he never answers the phone or any of my texts or letters, and her refuses all the flowers. I'm crying again. I can't even think about it, and I start to sob.
23	18 29 8 9 3 32 1 14 10 11	Keeping it classy. How awful.
23	12 31 14 7 26 10 16 22 29 8	God this is awful, I cannot understand a word they are saying.
23	6 5 15 31 12 16 1 11 27 25	I hope they are happy drinking their lives away
23	31 35 2 28 7 10 14 12 21 33	I supposed you want me to get in this contraption?
23	27 1 26 33 24 28 9 3 12 30	I don't think I'd be happy with that job.
23	32 14 34 4 12 35 5 7 11 9	The bland ceiling makes me feel sad.
23	19 20 21 8 27 6 9 11 22 24	Nothing but cows and grass -- I've never been more bored in my life.
23	29 2 11 22 31 9 3 19 10 12	I would hate to be out in the sun like this, all salty and wet.
23	6 20 30 22 33 32 10 17 12 4	Its hard work running around in the heat trying to kick the ball
23	19 14 27 31 25 3 35 15 34 32	I'll never be able to afford a car like that.
23	28 12 11 8 18 5 24 29 3 15	They look eager to leave, boring meeting.
23	29 6 24 19 25 27 26 22 11 28	I cannot fathom sitting listening to some silly presentation like this.
23	8 32 14 31 34 15 29 2 5 12	I don't want to go there.
23	1 34 32 33 18 19 26 15 11 7	I can't believe that I lost out on that car.
23	16 30 14 27 20 1 32 34 7 25	I would hate to climb that by foot.
23	31 8 5 10 22 30 26 9 12 35	Ugh. So cheesy and posed
23	8 24 9 17 34 5 11 2 27 33	I want them to fall down
23	26 20 12 11 15 27 2 21 31 7	This art piece is so terrible.
23	24 21 18 22 16 13 35 32 17 14	I am supposed to have a good time here?  How can I with company like THAT?
23	12 25 7 10 21 6 19 33 15 22	I'm glad someone's having a good time. I wish I had it in me to smile like that right now.
23	34 18 35 25 7 28 20 11 4 27	Omg this coffee is the worst!
23	20 13 26 34 29 9 18 15 17 33	Those knobs hanging on the wall look pitiful.
23	6 27 30 34 19 26 3 4 12 8	I could never run like that.
23	19 5 31 28 2 6 16 35 27 10	Oh my gosh, this doesn't look good. She looks like she is about to fall down. I don't have high hopes for this .
23	31 7 5 11 14 2 27 22 8 19	Some poor sucker is about to get married to some shrew and ruin his entire life.
23	18 4 14 9 29 7 34 30 24 11	Wandering between blocks of concrete is modern life in a nutshell.
23	15 34 20 2 11 1 35 14 29 3	Oh dear, this reminds of the poor insects affected by pollution
23	28 12 8 29 9 15 35 3 6 21	I'd come here too if I have money
23	2 10 13 30 27 25 34 20 6 33	It's too bad I couldn't make it there.
23	30 21 29 34 20 18 19 25 31 8	Unfortunately, I can't afford one.
23	1 3 24 33 19 31 29 30 27 6	The trees, water, and grass looks miserable as well that it is windy.
23	13 29 25 27 8 16 7 32 5 33	The kitten looks like he's had a hard day.
23	9 31 11 1 27 13 35 26 17 14	Oh boo hoo! Your car broke down in the middle of the street and you have to walk.
23	32 12 16 3 15 14 30 28 4 7	This artwork is pretty somber and it has fallen into disrepair.
23	27 11 17 33 7 6 14 21 3 4	I bet the owner of these cats is single like me. I am going to die with only my cats beside me.
23	11 28 34 26 2 17 21 9 1 19	Even these giant figures know how terrible life is.
23	6 33 11 8 9 14 10 16 29 15	looks like the water is way to cold..no thank you
23	20 7 9 25 30 32 14 31 19 22	Ugh. Another boring water scene. Even the way it reflects makes me unhappy.
23	6 3 9 1 35 29 19 13 27 15	War is such a nasty thing.
23	7 24 18 25 8 14 20 29 33 28	sports sports no no no haha even this makes me nausous haha
23	13 22 4 17 30 32 2 14 34 31	I hate this kind of music. Awful!
23	35 11 3 9 29 2 20 34 4 5	Another day, another broken train.
23	35 16 31 14 1 32 3 34 8 6	I hate these things! They're always in my backyard. I just want to hangout in my own yard, yet they're always there.
23	20 35 34 13 10 15 16 11 29 6	Lawn gnomes are stupid and they kind of scare me to be honest.
23	34 26 10 18 14 13 1 8 12 32	They make enough money to feed the world, and still people go hungry.
23	25 17 2 27 28 19 32 18 13 21	this blue makes me sad
23	12 18 4 6 24 30 32 1 21 19	So lame, I hate meetings, ugh!
23	19 20 3 28 31 2 16 26 5 1	The injury to the batters arm forced her out of the game and she is in a considerable amount of pain.
23	12 3 11 35 5 8 19 32 6 4	That looks like a terrible time! I'm glad you are there and not me.
23	21 35 32 18 19 8 5 13 34 4	If she couldn't open the wine she would not be happy!
23	18 11 19 9 20 34 32 2 5 15	man, looks like she is cold
23	8 25 14 2 4 16 17 27 35 1	Thi place looks like hell on earth.
23	26 34 13 18 31 28 32 9 2 12	Ugh, what a disgusting bug. I don't want anything to do with that foul creature!
23	34 26 28 33 6 24 30 35 20 1	These people look like they're having a great time, I wish I could be like that again.
23	2 7 32 21 8 10 19 22 1 11	This reminds me of the good old times, back when things were all fine... now, it's just so much different...
23	11 2 35 31 19 17 27 5 6 4	It is so cold here.
23	8 33 22 13 17 26 16 27 29 4	Poor kid, sacrificing his physical well being for the ephemeral cheers of the stands. Its not like most of these players actually go on to be real professionals.
23	25 22 10 26 21 2 18 5 8 34	Stuck in this place again
23	16 14 10 25 34 24 15 7 4 2	I can't stand cycling, it chafes.
23	16 31 24 28 32 7 14 1 13 4	This concert does not look that great.
23	15 28 31 25 33 27 8 3 13 5	Why on earth are all of those workers just standing around when there is so much work to be done?!
23	26 12 34 33 10 21 32 6 1 4	Ugh, I can't stand children.
23	12 6 34 26 2 33 4 5 13 32	It's a drab, decrepit building overlooking a sad worn-out bridge.
23	28 19 24 12 20 15 25 32 4 35	I'll never be able to afford to go see a place like this.
23	18 20 17 10 30 2 5 33 27 22	This would take forever to hike across and too much energy.
23	11 27 12 2 21 4 18 16 5 10	I think if I fell I'd be so upset.
23	13 25 32 21 22 29 18 20 6 35	She died two days later.
23	1 14 25 13 10 12 26 6 16 29	Wow, I'd hate to be in that traffic
23	7 4 11 33 29 28 2 22 26 16	That looks like such an awful time.
23	5 29 28 8 6 19 33 18 21 16	This is my house, it needs a lot of repairs.  I have no electricity and no water.  I can't even afford a whole door, I have to crawl in through a hole in the wall.
23	19 25 21 28 5 30 8 4 26 24	You Wouldn't Want To Fall Over The Falls. It's Be Horrible.
23	12 6 26 30 22 32 31 4 8 34	I see sad memories when I see this.
23	5 30 25 9 34 7 13 27 29 11	:So embarrassed that my brother is going to cry when he is marrying that witch
23	34 8 28 1 7 14 19 33 35 22	This tie makes me miserable.
23	2 17 29 7 20 4 8 30 5 12	Whenever I see a situation like this I can but feel depressed.
23	34 26 1 28 24 10 7 29 31 12	What a lame job, trying to build or fix some medieval-looking contraption...
23	22 8 4 35 25 20 18 7 16 12	This makes me think about death.
23	35 18 32 5 28 26 2 17 31 3	THIS WEATHER COMING IS GOING TO KILL THE CROPS
23	7 17 25 24 21 29 13 1 19 33	I can't wait for the end of the day, so tired!
23	31 1 13 3 6 9 18 22 29 12	The awful cold winter weather is never going to end.
23	10 1 27 9 8 30 25 34 7 33	I hate kids, they're the worst.
23	5 21 20 26 27 12 10 1 25 33	Betcha a climb up there would be downright awful.
23	27 16 2 10 11 20 13 30 35 34	This is the bane of my life.
23	14 20 24 22 9 18 19 6 8 2	Too many trees blocking the sunlight.
23	12 16 6 2 15 14 11 8 33 24	It is all wet and nasty. Yuck
23	13 24 11 16 33 8 18 32 1 10	THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS UNHAPPY WITH THE ONE ON THE LEFT.
23	33 7 3 34 29 18 35 9 13 12	Why does everyone have cute shoes except me?
23	22 32 12 30 8 4 2 10 35 3	Horrible, dirty sport, it really is
23	32 17 4 25 8 29 16 5 6 30	Ugh If I have to watch another wrestling match I will go insane!!
23	19 2 24 15 28 1 7 33 5 12	God, this is so depressing seeing old, decaying things.
23	4 22 27 9 12 17 34 3 32 18	i wish i was somewhere else
23	25 16 26 6 35 17 9 1 33 15	This chocolate reminds me of the time I had expired chocolate milk. Truly a terrible experience and one I would not want to ever experience again.
23	19 21 16 7 5 26 25 30 10 6	very naturally click this picture
23	34 7 11 28 13 26 14 10 8 20	group meeting always getting so bore
23	34 24 28 8 12 31 22 11 17 4	This seems like a terrible idea. Why hide behind a palm tree when so many bugs can fall on you? And to be wearing flip flops in this grass....why? Ants could bite you. This all makes me feel bad.
23	8 11 21 25 16 13 17 3 19 22	This party seems like even though it's trying to be lit, it's not.
23	5 16 22 8 13 11 33 6 17 34	slightly overweight male looks miserable towards camera
23	5 1 7 22 11 29 34 17 14 31	Ugh, those shops could use some work.
23	35 5 22 31 7 24 18 33 14 3	This looks like an incredibly boring meeting
23	24 22 32 9 25 11 27 15 12 33	I wish i can just jump over the bridge
23	3 26 17 28 5 29 10 2 20 8	It's a shame that this has blood on it.
23	3 17 19 8 1 6 30 20 4 16	i bet all the people in this photo are happier than me
23	5 29 33 8 16 28 25 21 22 18	Puppy tracks in the snow, probably a sign of a puppy never to be found... :(
23	1 30 29 26 14 24 18 7 8 27	I don't want to be here
23	24 10 27 1 12 19 28 15 22 32	This plant looks like it is dying in the bleak wilderness.
23	25 15 31 27 33 1 2 7 3 24	this is just the worst I own this is bad but I got terrible this is
23	32 29 6 17 20 35 14 22 30 33	The icing on that cupcake is going to drip down and cause a huge mess that'll probably take hours to clean up.
23	7 26 5 34 3 16 13 25 20 29	Planes are so loud, they drive me crazy.
23	17 32 21 11 22 34 27 26 16 1	I hate these flowers these are the ones i'm extremely allergic to
23	26 12 24 16 14 15 2 28 34 1	I don't want to be here
23	10 18 6 32 21 27 19 20 24 28	What a terrible day for me. I got stuck for hours because of all the garbage on the ground. Finally this guy came and picked it up for me.
23	7 20 4 27 34 17 5 3 22 26	So disgusting that they are still here
23	7 14 6 20 12 32 18 34 26 16	This guy will probably be all kinds of sore and back cramp tomorrow.  Makes me hurt.
23	34 20 6 10 1 2 12 26 25 16	I am stuck in this old crappy house, it has mice too!
23	11 33 28 35 15 16 6 32 14 10	I just want to fall down that hole
23	1 7 6 11 17 8 24 12 9 26	I will never marry like this woman. I will die alone.
23	11 21 18 15 25 19 3 29 28 31	There isn't enough holy water to cleanse my soul.
23	18 20 29 11 32 14 19 3 15 34	What a dump to live
23	31 35 8 29 3 7 5 30 16 24	Look at all the trash they left on the ground
23	13 10 26 21 6 19 1 15 7 24	Ah the girl scouts are back to make us all fat again
23	1 6 28 30 2 33 7 13 11 5	What another long boring drive to work.
23	1 19 11 34 12 17 2 35 7 29	Oh this weather that is about to happen is awful.
23	22 18 11 30 33 9 34 10 32 7	I can't stand when other people do their nails.
23	14 25 26 1 17 29 32 5 30 24	what a dreary little sleepy comunity
23	9 12 26 22 3 31 20 13 15 16	Its going to be a waste of time going down there
23	26 35 33 14 1 11 29 15 2 28	There is nothing to do here, it is so boring.
23	16 22 28 24 30 7 33 17 10 34	Its cold and this coat is not warm enough
23	10 14 21 3 4 1 5 29 12 20	Dark, boring, grey skies. Sunny days are better.
23	7 8 10 15 13 1 11 34 35 32	Like anyone has any reason to smile that much.
23	19 30 18 33 28 32 5 2 13 35	The fog in china is soo terrible, would never want to live there.
23	9 7 31 15 11 2 10 21 17 1	I want to jump inside
23	17 10 27 7 26 11 9 29 18 2	He is miserable because she has the blanket
23	32 20 15 19 25 31 22 6 3 21	I can't believe these have two securing systems.
23	11 9 22 3 18 20 33 5 10 34	Ugh, I would just feel lost in overwhelm and despair looking at this, it's too random. Fills me with blah.
23	15 17 34 24 3 28 31 2 18 29	They dont serve coffee here
23	15 6 8 7 31 35 17 12 2 5	Seeing those two happy just makes me sick.
23	20 13 24 8 22 16 29 6 3 2	Nobody cleaned up again, guess I have to.
23	25 35 32 33 3 13 8 5 21 18	Ugh, I can't even stand this music. I want to go home.
23	30 15 26 16 12 27 3 13 22 25	I hate the beach, it's to salty.
23	9 30 14 32 34 33 11 25 19 26	THE MAN THAT LIVES IN THIS HOUSE IS MEAN AND MISERABLE.
23	10 6 25 2 15 21 27 5 16 19	I think if it was hot I'd be upset here.
23	6 33 26 3 4 30 34 22 2 19	I think the darkness is upsetting.
23	22 13 5 17 4 16 25 20 27 32	its such a messy place
23	35 2 26 19 18 22 30 33 9 29	Ugh, Another day of hot weather on the lake.
23	6 13 11 8 16 25 28 14 17 2	I wish I didn't have to drive buses all day.
23	27 25 15 7 14 17 30 13 1 9	Ugh who even wants to go watch a game anyways
23	8 3 35 2 28 25 10 32 19 31	Why is the colors so bright for the sign and who picked the crazy background.
23	17 18 9 15 33 21 29 24 5 30	Why does she look good and I look like a potato?
23	28 34 1 13 16 7 31 18 15 22	It is just a nasty, hot, city, that is completely crowded.
23	27 15 19 18 7 30 5 6 16 3	I don't think I'd be upset eating that.
23	18 31 33 10 30 29 9 6 19 24	oh... this picture is so dreadful. look how awful it is!
23	20 7 14 12 9 2 33 19 24 28	Bothers me that the pictures may not be loading correctly.
23	8 2 28 26 16 24 32 22 12 4	This poor insect looks miserable
23	28 14 2 31 10 17 33 22 7 35	I see her happy but I feel so lonely and sad.
23	24 3 10 19 13 6 26 1 7 34	ugh that water looks so cold.
23	31 30 7 5 9 1 28 24 2 34	This looks like vomit garnished with parsley.
23	17 32 2 1 6 3 26 30 24 18	I hate these kind of shots.
23	13 33 24 30 9 15 3 16 5 27	Another building, another lawn, another day without the sun.
23	20 33 11 10 19 18 5 26 31 24	Too sad for this moment
23	34 32 15 27 13 33 9 26 25 22	This dog looks so happy... I wish I felt this way.
23	35 11 13 34 18 9 31 25 8 3	I wish i could go biking and climb rocks, but im stuck at home with nothing to do. No one to talk to
23	15 24 25 10 22 11 30 17 13 28	I would hate to walk up that hill
23	11 22 19 33 4 27 3 20 35 31	Wow, I wish I could afford to go skiing
23	17 8 11 20 1 18 28 25 6 32	I cannot believe I have to go into this building once again. ugh!
23	27 29 19 30 4 24 8 35 1 22	I wish someone would come in...
23	32 28 22 13 7 20 18 14 3 11	A considerable amount of people are having a hard time to live atleast an average life.
23	11 32 30 29 13 3 17 6 12 14	My everyday life summed up in one picture.
23	6 30 29 35 2 13 8 11 7 27	I am not amused here
23	26 25 9 19 8 31 4 24 3 32	I couldn't be more upset.
23	16 4 28 25 20 11 9 26 18 7	I wish I could even come close to having that much fun as this person.
23	20 18 19 2 29 14 3 35 33 15	I cannot have someone like that
23	34 6 29 26 35 25 18 1 11 31	HE IS NOT HER TYPE
23	12 21 27 22 5 25 14 11 33 28	I feel so sorry for whoever is in this car
23	10 26 19 33 12 1 25 22 31 20	I lived here for years without food
23	15 35 8 1 26 13 16 18 9 17	Pants that tight drive me nuts.
23	33 35 18 10 14 20 1 5 11 8	I hate the snow, everything is so depressing.
23	2 14 19 25 24 13 27 6 9 17	FIVE hours later. . . still at the DMV :(((
23	14 7 4 30 8 2 34 17 5 20	It must've been hard to walk through this crowd.
23	13 6 33 16 4 12 21 3 14 10	These dogs remind me of all my childhood dogs. So sad.
23	16 18 1 24 19 7 14 12 17 4	Somewhere to jump out and die
23	25 34 21 31 28 10 33 16 35 9	I would make a comment about this sign if the sun weren't in my eyes.
23	25 7 12 6 35 26 34 4 24 8	I am not young enough to play with these kids anymore.
23	1 27 9 26 28 16 4 31 22 13	The people look to be so sad.
23	19 9 16 8 24 25 4 6 30 11	Another kind of stupid looking weed.
23	33 13 18 20 34 15 8 9 19 32	"I can never park here for the life of me."
23	26 33 6 27 10 3 7 24 14 28	Ugh. That pool looks like it is freezing cold. Probably why they are just standing around talking and no one is swimming.
23	30 18 29 22 20 4 27 32 19 21	I couldn't stand the ceremony. it was so long and so tedious. I just wanted to go home.
23	22 4 1 9 31 32 5 29 3 8	I wish I could live life like this.  Getting old and all of the aches, and pains. Depressing.
23	35 24 16 21 1 27 7 14 11 33	You guys should leave that place immediately, it's awful.
23	24 27 20 29 3 1 2 31 17 26	It is so hot out here.  And crowded.  And how long is this going to take?
23	21 16 4 14 22 6 9 17 3 5	That looks absolutely horrifying to be.
23	31 18 32 16 1 35 27 21 7 14	Somebody lost their mask. That's so sad. Now the mask is going to have a miserable end to its existance with nobody left to care for it.
23	30 5 1 8 7 12 6 33 29 10	Ugh, i can't stand grass because it activated my allergies
23	12 6 9 24 1 35 19 30 17 14	I feel like crap, I cannot afford a car like this.
23	28 5 14 34 7 27 9 18 20 25	i hope they fall in and drown
23	10 12 13 4 1 29 24 31 17 14	The dead animal makes me feel depressed.
23	11 4 25 32 31 3 14 30 6 28	Who is going to be left to clean that mess up, me, thats who.
23	32 9 22 18 5 31 8 15 24 35	A formerly verdant forest-scape, reduced to a series of naked husks.  Sounds disturbingly similar to my hope for a better life.
23	18 15 20 7 8 9 30 14 21 10	Ugh.  Soo dark and gloomy.
23	11 24 4 18 29 13 33 30 31 17	My life isnt as good as his
23	28 14 1 21 16 26 8 22 19 24	Is it dark to use DEAD TREES to fence off living tree's? Just thinking about how many tree's died to make that stupid fence. Humans are the worst
23	24 9 15 13 33 11 28 14 18 32	What a ugly choice of a image.
23	33 2 4 11 1 10 35 31 16 26	I don't think this looks fun at all.
23	26 21 28 25 4 9 10 13 34 35	He makes me think of when my son was little. I miss him so much and wish he was here.
23	7 14 29 4 10 33 27 26 19 21	Is there a point to this mouse!
23	35 11 16 1 25 8 13 21 31 17	ugh! I bet being in that meeting must really suck@
23	35 9 17 24 32 12 21 19 18 16	It's horrible trying to select a new wordpress theme.
23	21 28 25 33 15 1 12 11 18 14	I would die instantly  in a car that size if I crashed.
23	32 12 14 35 33 26 3 9 28 11	How can anyone enjoy themselves in this picture? The sun's heat is brutal.
23	33 7 24 30 32 1 22 15 26 12	I absolutely hate the rain.
23	21 16 3 7 6 14 12 19 15 33	It's so weird that other places have so much culture but we don't.
23	35 22 8 25 10 34 32 16 14 4	Its too hot out there, the weather is unbearable
23	25 7 4 29 20 10 22 30 28 32	Man i feel miserable today
23	35 19 5 12 10 20 28 26 6 33	I really don't like cities. They are so depressing.
23	27 35 33 17 6 32 13 25 16 5	I tried to use the whip like he does but I hit myself in the face and got a bloody nose.
23	27 5 11 7 9 2 25 10 19 32	I don't like music. I don't like dancing
23	9 32 17 6 35 28 20 30 13 15	That guy looks so unhappy.
23	4 10 22 7 1 8 15 3 2 33	How terrible it must have been to spend that much time cooped up in a space ship.
23	28 33 7 19 26 10 3 8 29 12	The pie was so delicious I wanted to savor every last bite!
23	1 31 6 27 9 25 28 15 5 8	I am the woman in the blue.
23	11 26 16 7 21 12 30 18 32 17	Blah this sand gets in places I didn't even know it could go!
23	4 7 12 35 24 18 32 30 14 29	Would be a good show if they dressed an bit more decent.
23	10 17 2 4 7 24 26 6 8 18	yes some time this world can make you feel that way but you cant give up
23	13 11 2 7 34 12 26 19 1 30	This looks pretty exhausting to me.
23	20 8 21 35 12 24 4 29 34 16	State spending money on more work they don't need.
23	14 27 17 31 26 5 6 7 11 24	My bum hurts and its hot I want to go home
23	35 21 4 11 18 14 28 15 30 22	impentrable fog...jus like the fog that is my life after she left.  There's nothing ahead.
23	1 35 33 34 28 2 7 8 5 27	This lady is making me tired with her bike.
23	25 19 20 15 10 8 13 18 21 30	What is wrong with you? you are going to brake my 0.99 cent ball
23	17 7 18 5 15 35 11 25 34 27	When is it going to end? I can't stand it much longer
23	2 3 11 20 21 17 34 35 32 24	My boss is a horrible person. I can't believe he forced me to come to this terrible event.
23	21 14 28 26 31 12 29 25 15 30	Another dreary day with two broken scooters.
23	31 21 35 33 12 9 8 1 5 18	Oh boy, another useless arcade for our children to waste away in
23	13 16 28 27 17 12 21 29 7 18	Dark skies. Rain. Nobody nearby. Euch.
23	7 28 3 26 30 25 12 18 22 9	I hope he doesn't break a leg.
23	15 25 27 35 8 2 30 5 1 24	I feel pity when i see athletes putting the body through so much pain.
23	8 26 2 15 34 7 28 13 19 27	This is stupid, what are these people celebrating?
23	8 20 19 26 30 24 4 16 5 6	I want my own forge but I can't afford one.. my life is the worst.
23	17 34 26 32 35 1 8 13 6 15	This looks just like the bridge I have to walk by on the way to my depression counselor .
23	10 31 9 26 21 3 6 18 25 28	probably coworkers who hate each other
23	34 8 2 18 30 5 12 1 3 31	That poor child does not look happy!
23	33 9 26 19 1 30 22 5 32 29	ugh the city looks so dirty
23	26 6 27 17 28 25 5 7 3 11	I wouldn't be caught dead in that!
23	17 4 12 33 21 19 22 34 30 28	I'm freezing and all this snow is just making me shiver.
23	31 32 16 12 1 17 5 9 11 22	uhg, put on some clothes!
23	13 3 11 15 28 17 21 12 24 16	As black as I feel.
23	18 17 20 2 9 19 22 27 29 15	The race couldn't have gotten any worse.
23	13 8 11 21 5 1 12 6 4 9	Who would want to climb up rocks? what a terrible idea
23	21 29 35 28 8 1 7 33 16 32	Even on a day like this all I can think of is loss
23	20 34 7 12 8 21 2 13 1 26	It looks so hot outside.
23	14 12 29 31 7 5 1 11 24 4	Looks lonely. Maybe I should join them..
23	16 28 31 20 33 35 6 24 9 10	Hot sun and went ground. I already can't breathe.
23	27 20 3 17 18 2 30 15 25 1	I hate the city, I hate the bright lights,I hate the traffic
23	19 15 21 12 25 11 26 27 3 28	I hate the dry weather.
23	22 2 7 1 34 20 14 6 33 31	Quasi Moto had a hunchback and people judged him.
23	17 14 26 24 7 19 27 21 11 16	It is so hot and muggy here, I am betting that pregnant ladies baby is even sweating
23	10 13 17 20 1 4 9 7 12 3	I wish I could travel.
23	31 22 18 17 19 32 8 34 25 29	It's too hot , there are too many people, and it's too noisy
23	20 9 1 26 14 5 34 33 19 2	This runner looks like she's about to pass out.
23	13 15 9 26 11 6 16 33 1 12	This sports car is probably stuck on the metal scaffolding.
23	7 2 9 22 18 19 34 35 20 33	Lovely picture, I would look horrible in red though.
23	30 24 28 3 21 20 9 33 27 1	Hopefully that animal isn't dead.
23	19 22 30 11 31 20 33 28 3 7	I can't even remember the last time I went on a bike ride :(
23	13 12 14 1 19 8 22 20 4 10	I wish I had places to use that were so beautiful.
23	9 15 13 7 33 4 19 26 6 29	CO LOUR FULL GREEN COCONUTS TREES .LOOKING CUTE FEEL
23	9 33 10 25 28 4 1 31 2 32	As gloomy as I feel.
23	7 15 14 35 26 18 10 2 24 16	First, I have to take off my shoes in here and now I have to eat off the floor?
23	15 14 32 5 12 6 27 22 13 4	Just watching him run is making my knees hurt, Soccer doesn't even look fun.
23	6 24 32 22 17 28 2 26 3 8	I've been trapped in this yard and now am forced to feed from these humans.
23	34 10 29 7 21 9 31 11 14 4	I used to have a jet ski, but I crashed it and broke my leg recently.  It still hurts.
23	20 14 9 22 11 8 2 10 30 33	It looks like it is going to rain, again.
23	9 24 25 2 7 16 12 6 20 1	There is nothing good about this color
23	12 13 8 9 4 33 26 28 34 11	I think this guy is having a horrible time.
23	30 32 16 25 10 7 2 20 17 6	I can't stand these flowers.
23	7 13 18 33 4 31 17 34 35 24	I'm so tired of those t-shirts
23	5 1 34 14 32 22 3 16 18 30	Uggghh.. I absolutely hate the task of painting.. why oh why me
23	19 16 2 35 15 25 10 20 26 18	the weather reflects how i feel. stormy inside
23	11 17 35 33 30 25 6 21 10 24	It was miserable to see that no tourist was visiting this beautiful desert but the locals were still trying hard to sell their beautiful handmade arts.
23	17 27 26 5 8 18 3 29 35 11	This thing will probably fall apart easily.
23	7 35 26 22 13 12 32 14 20 27	Ugh I don't understand how people like these kind of animals; they're so scaly and weird looking.
23	22 17 16 6 13 29 3 21 7 18	I am so bored with this woman taking photos
23	20 9 4 35 13 32 29 8 30 21	Where I wish i was right now
23	20 33 26 24 9 5 25 8 12 6	Looks like a self portrait for me.  Can't seem to get back on my feet
23	6 5 2 16 20 3 15 22 35 34	This beach where my girlfriend dumped me
23	35 9 18 7 29 16 26 32 5 14	There is too much green, I hate green
23	35 21 15 26 29 16 11 24 3 28	Why would you cut a piece of of a book?
23	16 29 35 5 4 26 1 14 33 34	That sun looks too hot and that grass makes me feel itchy just looking at it.
23	17 7 21 16 8 14 6 33 9 1	I despite sporting events, I would rather play sporting games through a gaming console.
23	13 25 15 29 33 2 20 9 3 30	I can imagine a time when all that water is gone, our natural resources drained.
23	34 4 15 22 3 29 25 13 11 1	This makes me feel small and caged in. Like I've been locked in some horrible prison, alone, for something I didn't do.
23	27 18 25 4 32 11 24 20 29 30	That babies diaper is full of feces
23	4 9 28 34 32 29 27 19 25 2	I hate when the sky is blue like this.
23	13 20 9 25 26 5 16 1 2 27	The coast looks so sad, i would rather stay away from it!
23	2 32 31 29 7 4 1 28 18 12	Maybe the girl dressed like a pirate will fall down on her fake hook.
23	31 1 24 16 12 20 30 19 18 11	ugh I don't care about anything in this picture.
23	8 14 6 12 25 21 2 15 34 22	Selling my wares in this cramped alley day after day is not making me happy.
23	24 32 17 21 3 22 13 18 27 20	Ugh, why is the window even open?
23	27 4 8 13 32 12 6 33 19 17	This just makes me sad.
23	18 30 33 17 8 29 26 21 32 31	Ugh, I wish I was in that photo instead of here.
23	17 8 9 18 31 6 32 33 13 25	Look at how we treat our urban centers. Is it no wonder that society is decaying
23	5 14 29 22 24 34 19 17 8 35	I hope this is the last of the show, I want to go home already
23	13 22 10 5 8 26 32 15 33 11	Seeing these people makes me want to vomit.
23	28 32 6 30 14 29 17 31 7 21	Another down and out trying to get the last of his fix is the story of too many these days.
23	25 34 9 8 29 14 12 7 21 3	I don't know why they make me dress like this.
23	17 34 21 33 10 25 12 29 18 6	whoever taking this picture must be falling asleep in boredom
23	7 19 1 8 21 20 9 30 3 5	Prison is worse for these flowers.
23	18 32 16 25 2 26 29 33 3 9	I'll bet his shoot didn't open.
23	2 11 26 19 6 25 12 35 15 7	The colors and logo are all wrong.
23	24 7 31 16 8 33 17 14 4 18	With nothing to do and noone to do it with, I walked around the lake and saw no animals.
23	7 17 2 6 31 27 8 11 30 33	fun muchlike  lookdoesn't  That
23	28 14 35 7 30 12 32 8 17 13	I hate any shade of red, it is so depressing.
23	35 32 28 12 1 6 14 25 10 31	I can't speak this language. I feel so stupid.
23	3 27 15 1 22 6 29 26 2 8	It has to be less than 0 degrees there.  There is no way your face is not in pain
23	7 14 32 33 8 25 24 6 28 16	that kids hair is awful
23	11 34 28 7 16 21 27 2 12 8	These paintings make me want to cry.
23	13 21 33 22 2 27 10 25 3 18	Setting up the audio for this show was an absolute nightmare.
23	24 12 31 10 7 25 29 34 21 32	This Woman is so rude not funny and has a horrible hair cut.
23	30 34 3 6 2 27 1 5 35 9	This view makes me feel better
23	29 33 17 6 11 21 3 26 9 35	I hate keyboards. I just stare at computers or keyboards all day, every day at a dead-end job.
23	21 13 25 1 12 28 5 10 9 4	I always lose at Poker.
23	4 29 8 19 34 15 35 1 27 24	I don't have enough money to have one of these :(.
23	8 19 6 10 5 13 21 17 29 3	Ugh- if I see one more happy couple I'm going to cry.
23	5 6 16 27 9 21 11 10 32 29	I wish I had a family member to do things with.
23	12 13 30 14 29 34 15 7 21 35	Great, just another bland picture to this bland day. When will things get better?
23	4 16 8 6 20 32 24 9 1 11	What the heck,this dude canot pay me 5 usd and still get a 5 star hotel room, you cheap.
23	8 1 21 9 16 12 32 35 10 25	Oh look, more people who call themselves musicians...
23	16 33 25 10 13 19 22 28 27 14	Beautiful women make me feel terrible about myself.
23	7 34 6 1 12 29 14 30 28 15	Looks like a horrible day at a horrible place.
23	19 9 13 34 5 24 33 11 32 16	This makes me feel more sick than I already am...
23	34 12 33 22 16 26 35 17 10 4	i dislike him, i hope everyone agrees with me cause i am right and i dislike everyone
23	9 35 30 20 29 32 8 24 5 15	You guys look like the awkward group that was forced to hang out together.
23	27 9 24 10 4 2 17 13 12 16	Who cares about historical sites?
23	1 4 22 35 10 13 29 14 27 17	the bear is so lonely but I don't really feel that bad for it because so am i
23	33 27 19 31 20 10 14 15 18 35	Doesn't not look miserable to me.
23	30 24 3 15 29 25 11 4 35 13	very unhappy with inadequate content, pictures please.
23	27 22 19 11 24 28 17 8 31 29	Oh, my goodness! The policemen on foot don't seem well-prepared to deal with a strike.
23	10 34 16 21 9 8 14 15 13 32	I wish I had money.
23	19 4 27 12 10 13 6 34 35 32	This looks like alot of droppings  would be on my car
23	35 11 30 32 15 17 14 26 20 24	the subways had been the reasons for some mysteries
23	13 14 2 10 11 1 6 28 27 34	These two birds got the life.  Just sit there and do nothing all day.
23	35 6 22 17 19 30 4 3 1 5	I wish that I was able to smile like this.
23	2 33 19 16 7 24 12 15 27 31	Seeing this makes me sad and I don't understand why there isn't more help available.
23	10 2 35 29 16 34 20 19 26 13	I haven't been able to get out of bed since he's died.
23	6 28 27 32 24 8 10 19 9 30	Reminds me of the times I would get bullied
23	22 20 27 18 7 17 26 12 14 11	Ugh this will make me ill
23	35 2 30 5 1 20 24 17 32 12	Such a bland pointless view.
23	15 28 27 18 21 26 31 34 14 29	will you stop calling me
23	26 29 2 34 16 6 31 1 4 32	These kids are so boring.
23	27 18 12 24 22 1 28 33 6 13	I'll never be able to afford a car like that!
23	8 14 22 26 6 10 2 17 31 24	My son will never finish the art project, I am destined to never having a clean floor.
23	6 27 12 33 15 7 17 31 20 10	This kid doesn't look like he's having a good time.
23	4 9 26 21 6 22 12 20 18 5	Poor birds. Probably going to die alone like me.
23	21 11 4 19 5 35 1 17 12 6	It is so hot in here and they make us wear these helmets.
23	2 30 7 10 24 20 1 35 17 19	Do we really have to keep shopping?
23	7 18 34 12 15 1 10 32 19 16	This is stupid, why would you post this>
23	5 15 11 35 14 6 30 8 31 16	This kid looks pretty sassy to me, I've never bonded with kids in my family. Kids are just too germy!
23	27 10 35 22 14 33 24 18 30 28	I can't believe you dragged me here. This is dumb and it's the worst night of my life
23	4 20 27 26 33 8 14 16 32 21	This makes me afraid of heights in the opposite way.
23	7 34 3 24 8 6 5 2 29 4	Well nothing is growing like it should again! It never does each year.
23	6 24 32 16 4 1 21 31 17 26	omg i cant even see the photo looks boring
23	9 16 21 10 6 31 2 28 24 30	A drunk man is desperately trying to score.
23	11 26 14 2 9 5 34 13 21 8	This algae bloom choked all the life out of the lake - there's little hope to stop this from happening anywhere.
23	32 29 35 11 1 10 25 9 17 8	This adolescent likely has no future but a life of graffiti and crime.
23	2 15 13 26 32 6 20 18 11 14	He is not having fun
23	8 9 18 14 30 24 26 17 7 35	Nothing more depressing than trying to raise a baby in a concrete world.
23	35 30 16 11 1 33 7 12 3 31	Looks like this guy is having a really hard time putting this back together.
23	20 13 29 11 33 5 12 32 24 21	Looks like they've made worse of it.
23	30 29 20 14 2 34 16 15 31 9	I shouldn't have come to see such a depressing display.  If things were bad then, there's no hope for the world now.
23	26 13 16 12 33 29 2 25 18 4	The pitcher blew the lead for his team.
23	21 33 32 7 16 27 18 9 30 31	Ma, I'd rather be out on that hike instead of here going to church.
23	9 1 3 20 33 13 8 24 29 19	I really don't care if I'm in a tropical paradise.  I feel awful.
23	28 29 11 21 8 12 13 2 18 34	I get so sad and can't stand to watch him get onto her.
23	26 7 33 19 34 14 12 15 8 18	I hope this mans friends enjoy being around him, unlike mine.
23	14 6 20 21 35 24 1 28 17 11	Those plants will probably just die
23	13 1 17 26 19 11 9 5 27 12	I hate nature so much
23	3 24 21 32 1 27 16 15 10 31	Looks like a horrible time, glad I'm not there.
23	19 7 22 11 33 5 35 4 26 18	I wish I could have a life as easy as a plant.
23	26 2 8 1 12 34 7 22 6 18	I would not want to run, and specially not by a train track. I would be so miserable.
23	13 6 29 4 15 22 20 31 35 14	is that sushi or desert made to look like sushi? Why is on a plate like that
23	26 29 31 17 20 3 16 19 8 14	One blow and off of those petals are gone.
23	24 6 21 15 29 26 18 10 14 19	I just want to cry when i look at pictures.
23	7 4 30 24 22 15 5 17 28 14	This looks like everywhere in the midwest, what a dump. Gross.
23	9 33 21 24 29 30 6 13 27 17	Ugh, yes I'm a starfish. No, my name isn't Patrick.
23	26 5 33 31 10 4 2 29 34 28	Well this looks like a good enough place to die alone.
23	6 26 28 24 7 12 4 21 5 3	This poor man must have suffered greatly during the war. Even if he survived, he probably suffered for years after.
23	8 7 28 10 29 20 19 31 35 3	Wonder how many broken bones they have between all of them.
23	5 12 32 16 13 27 34 4 14 24	there are so many people
23	15 35 22 33 8 4 28 2 5 19	This place looks too cluttered...
23	11 24 21 13 20 7 3 17 18 12	I'm going to let you out
23	19 32 6 4 26 33 20 15 16 29	The clouds are blocking the sunset
23	4 5 1 21 31 18 2 6 15 16	Guitar music drives me mad.
23	20 14 1 24 11 18 29 26 4 15	Nobody will ever take me anywhere that fun looking.
23	1 20 18 5 8 31 6 11 15 12	There are too many colors in this picture.
23	31 34 13 17 14 7 35 6 15 9	An older lady that probably has a better life than me.
23	32 1 13 9 24 12 16 11 34 6	What the hell is that?
23	18 32 4 19 7 5 25 17 11 27	how do I get attention
23	16 34 32 21 7 19 14 22 24 1	I feel sorry for him the Islanders are terrible.
23	15 32 12 19 22 6 21 25 4 10	I will pass out if I have to sit for another picture with this family.
23	10 8 19 5 13 28 34 22 16 7	As usual, this photo just makes me more sad.
23	5 26 21 24 27 31 6 4 1 34	Looking at this makes me tired, I just can't bear to look at photos anymore
23	1 34 15 5 10 20 2 26 9 32	I can not play anymore. Bad knees, and that's it! My dreams are gone.
23	3 17 2 4 20 24 8 27 35 16	i would hate to smell those
23	17 21 14 1 25 34 22 15 35 27	the smog makes me hate the city.
23	19 20 10 34 1 21 9 27 6 29	They are having fun and me here...
23	2 29 33 25 26 22 13 14 27 16	That bear looks like how I feel. Dark on the inside...
23	33 11 10 20 14 25 8 31 16 24	Boy, that giant ice cream cone sculpture reminds me of my diet.
23	6 32 11 22 16 28 1 5 29 8	I wouldn't want to go there. I would be under immense pain having to sit in those chairs and learn my piece.
23	16 22 15 25 35 26 32 13 21 29	This day is as gray as my mood.
23	19 30 34 4 3 24 18 20 28 15	Wow these people look like they are having a GREAT time. Not.
23	29 24 15 34 1 35 16 14 10 12	I'm so depressed that I'll never have a nice car.
23	16 32 2 24 19 5 8 6 35 26	What's so fun about this?
23	20 22 28 19 12 6 4 5 18 30	I am never going to swim again.
23	30 33 10 3 18 15 2 8 11 19	Reminds me of my job which is slowly sucking the life out of me.
23	34 6 28 3 22 31 18 29 7 12	As a city dweller, living in a large, open area with nothing but trees and a lake would be quite miserable for me.
23	21 25 31 10 4 18 9 14 6 3	They just look too happy.
23	24 12 4 29 17 34 11 5 21 33	How much longer do I have to stay at this dinner? Feeling sick.
23	26 14 9 21 17 2 15 19 3 12	They can make your life miserable if they want to.
23	11 4 10 18 13 30 33 27 17 35	Short lived lives for nothing.
23	2 22 3 15 34 4 16 26 29 32	The cracks in this sidewalk remind me of the many cracks that have formed in my life.
23	8 33 35 5 4 31 21 2 22 15	This makes me want to crawl into bed.
23	19 5 11 27 14 32 29 18 2 15	He is not a very good looking guy.
23	28 19 13 12 27 24 3 25 1 8	I am not looking forward to rolling up all of that orange fencing in this cold wind.
23	34 20 10 33 30 19 9 14 22 4	What an ugly sea creature, maybe I'll eat him for dinner.
23	16 32 17 18 1 2 10 34 11 25	It's so hot here at this concert and everyone keeps bumping into me and I just wish I had stayed at home. This is terrible.
23	7 21 1 33 10 30 9 31 35 24	all i want it lunch, is that so much to ask for?!
23	11 5 27 10 28 12 21 29 19 8	Why can't I have parents that dress me up like that?
23	32 6 22 12 24 34 10 26 33 25	I could keep walking so easily...
23	33 8 24 3 11 1 15 29 4 16	How dejected this flower feels to be all on its lonesome
23	7 32 5 24 34 25 28 11 6 8	I hate hanging out with them. It's never fun
23	17 25 18 9 31 35 4 1 14 16	No one wanted to attend the meeting.
23	19 8 21 14 4 20 31 9 10 15	Why are they're so many clouds. It's so gloomy and dull.
23	29 26 3 24 6 1 8 11 32 4	What a scary photo, I wouldn't want to be outside.
23	5 21 33 18 9 22 31 10 32 1	Big cities full of people are the worst.
23	17 12 33 9 10 22 30 8 20 28	I am late for a funeral.
23	9 32 19 29 1 22 7 34 35 16	It took an entire hour to get to the top of this mountain. The view managed to get old.
23	7 17 21 25 8 19 31 10 28 9	She wants to go put her head down on her desk.
23	29 7 13 21 16 32 14 28 17 25	That cartoon guy gets more action than I do.
23	8 25 9 21 31 22 12 5 17 6	I have to watch these stupid fireworks and get eaten up by mosquitos
23	25 20 5 6 13 34 1 11 32 24	Ugh what an ugly jacket
23	4 27 26 16 13 1 14 3 25 9	I wish I could sit down and rest instead of touring another site.
23	22 34 33 11 19 7 15 32 30 31	I don't like that view at all
23	28 27 32 19 24 30 5 2 33 35	I hate trains, almost as much as I hate myself.
23	12 20 31 15 6 16 27 24 7 32	A terrible picture that is hard to see.
23	25 10 18 11 24 3 27 16 17 12	Working here would be torture.
23	33 24 18 21 26 34 1 19 8 2	This guy is making me sad.
23	21 14 16 18 13 22 35 24 30 27	I think I would wear horns to spice up the looks of that cake, too.
23	21 8 12 3 4 14 30 6 7 9	Cutting these plants is just the worst, I want to quit.
23	16 24 31 17 25 28 13 10 11 26	Unfortunately those flowers will die and are wasted money.
24	18 27 8 5 12 16 1 3 19 15	If they don't stop blocking my view with their flag, one of them is getting knocked over.
24	20 2 3 29 7 31 13 28 35 5	Beat that drum like your life depended on it
24	5 1 15 21 6 17 22 20 32 28	THIS FAT CAT WILL EAT YOUR LUNCH.
24	17 16 9 26 8 22 34 5 14 12	I would fight to get this car, it is the perfect car for me!
24	5 7 32 30 2 4 22 23 17 27	Despite her leg being a machine gun I know I could take her in a fight!
24	3 27 19 16 6 22 1 28 34 21	I HATE WHEN THERE IS FLOODING!
24	2 19 28 34 33 14 18 21 6 3	I would like to continuo destroy that wall
24	12 23 16 34 1 20 22 28 15 2	Looks like they would be annoying.
24	33 4 13 35 32 19 17 27 29 34	I think it would be rough to be here.
24	10 1 32 20 13 7 28 5 35 34	He looks like he's looking for a fight.  Now I am... bring it on!
24	32 22 4 9 28 26 31 14 7 19	Only dumb people use Crowne Plaza.
24	23 17 21 22 34 20 32 11 6 2	I want to swim after that penguin.
24	27 21 10 25 11 31 14 19 33 15	I hope this guy falls out of the boat and ruins his clothes.
24	6 33 21 20 29 34 17 2 5 12	I hate his yellow shirt.
24	7 34 27 20 23 19 4 32 8 14	I think that kid shouldn't be eating that.
24	18 33 35 27 25 15 17 34 20 10	I think the picture could be better.
24	19 15 33 2 12 17 9 34 26 7	That is an ugly bike, SERIOUSLY I hate it!
24	11 18 32 7 6 12 15 21 9 23	Looks like there's still room to build some more hotels.
24	5 30 26 7 25 4 34 3 33 18	These are my attack dogs
24	21 8 30 12 25 23 18 17 6 26	Imagine a fire destroying this
24	35 9 16 14 7 4 23 30 31 5	That's right Max. You can get him!!!
24	35 26 2 4 6 20 17 33 11 23	It's just not something I understand the appeal of! Such a plain tattoo and such a plain bracelet. If you think it's nice, that's up to you, but I don't get it.
24	27 35 8 12 29 1 13 6 34 30	Id race that down i-90, put a macho quatro steel converter in it and jack the rotors up to like 100rpms!
24	32 31 9 8 17 26 14 20 11 6	Wow well this sucks am I right
24	35 15 13 31 17 8 7 32 3 22	That is the worst painting that I ever seen.  I hate it.
24	3 4 1 5 21 6 15 34 18 29	I'm taking the flyers, no questions asked
24	8 28 16 32 4 26 2 21 35 5	Someone will break their ankle on those rocks, you should sue!
24	18 27 31 17 26 2 4 29 19 3	I think they know better than to try and hold me under water.
24	16 2 34 4 1 9 5 25 3 7	I'd make my man carry the umbrella, too.
24	34 19 18 15 23 20 6 11 26 17	bro wtf are you even doing for real
24	10 22 26 20 28 16 3 11 23 18	\I need to sail across this faster than John.
24	23 4 31 28 19 10 33 8 1 12	Ugh I would like to burn these sort of looking things.
24	11 15 29 10 33 22 18 14 34 13	There's too many people here for my liking!
24	10 26 11 21 8 33 2 23 6 7	Look at how stupid these dolphins are. Who would ever want to go watch something like this?
24	23 15 5 34 18 25 26 1 30 35	The lighting is very dark.
24	17 18 30 9 35 20 11 10 4 25	Shake is like storm to my tummy
24	18 33 19 14 23 16 17 20 2 8	Get a real dog. That's a kitten.
24	5 7 21 4 12 28 3 10 9 13	This light is way to abrasive
24	7 33 26 28 3 22 27 34 23 4	The candles must be apart of someone's vigil
24	34 3 21 19 8 29 33 15 1 27	I don't know why this person is filming me
24	20 31 16 5 33 14 15 32 11 35	I want to break every one of those cats
24	16 17 22 5 10 8 15 21 20 7	I would march right up to those doors and kick them in!
24	3 18 7 15 22 31 17 2 9 25	Basically me on a friday night
24	32 34 11 28 35 7 12 13 30 19	What's going on here???  Why is everyone squatting???  I need answers now!
24	27 8 1 7 15 3 31 19 32 17	He was eager to examine the snail.
24	13 3 30 6 33 26 10 14 23 12	Something religious is taking place here.
24	5 19 20 10 27 9 8 23 2 12	The words shout at you.
24	9 13 21 27 5 33 31 11 15 19	I bet they argue a lot.
24	32 35 9 19 34 12 33 15 28 22	A lady is with two little girls.
24	34 18 7 32 2 10 1 30 17 19	Look at that horrible engine. Who was the fool that left it?
24	14 11 35 12 34 26 1 19 15 13	That’s dumb. Who would want to use that shade of green?
24	16 9 19 1 23 5 21 27 6 14	I will kill anyone that disrespects this symbol!
24	19 20 7 12 14 28 17 34 6 33	I would not like being in that large crowd of people.
24	13 15 16 17 10 12 14 27 21 28	I would never look at this website!
24	29 11 17 3 7 21 32 20 13 14	Look at him stand there like a monochromatic bearded struggling director!
24	7 3 27 1 8 4 30 34 35 23	Aggressive musician in the club
24	30 5 12 22 34 23 31 10 19 27	I hate the stupid ocean!
24	33 26 11 1 28 2 9 22 14 27	It's hard to see the text since its so small.
24	29 35 31 14 4 18 11 20 25 21	I would go insane if I had to stand in a room with all these people, I need my personal space! I would have to tell everyone to back off of me.
24	25 31 18 15 28 11 7 17 22 21	A car should steer toward the motorcycle
24	30 17 23 21 34 27 18 14 12 25	Two cats isn't worth half a dog.
24	3 34 7 29 28 6 4 22 19 13	Who wears a business suit to the library!?! Losers.
24	3 6 21 18 9 33 7 28 17 26	This kid is about to defeat the ball by kicking it
24	13 1 7 11 6 29 9 19 33 17	I hate the way they're flipping the pancakes
24	33 17 22 9 13 31 25 32 8 15	why wont he just leave
24	10 1 27 15 20 14 25 28 7 22	That lizard is ready to prey.
24	5 8 30 4 22 18 13 27 1 32	WATCH OUT FOR THE SEA TURTLES
24	13 5 21 29 11 32 35 17 9 1	I threw my clock into the wall and now it's broken. Stupid clock! Dan better fix it or I'll be mad.
24	35 20 32 7 28 22 9 8 33 16	Oh man! That elephant is about to charge, it's going to be gnarly!
24	8 2 31 27 5 1 30 29 16 23	That's right, pack your stuff, get out!
24	15 35 7 18 16 22 3 34 19 33	No place for religious photos here.
24	31 7 14 5 27 35 23 10 12 26	I would like to rip into the purse in the background.
24	6 27 25 5 20 28 30 21 18 1	I told you we would have a full house. You had better be sure there are enough copies of the transcript.
24	25 17 12 30 32 28 10 34 6 31	I will break the windows
24	15 25 20 7 28 8 4 11 16 9	Overcast weather and dull scenery!
24	6 31 7 13 18 23 9 28 15 19	This is stupid! Who cares about a weird looking building?!
24	14 32 34 28 11 13 16 9 30 26	This beer does NOT look good AT ALL.
24	3 25 28 7 1 22 19 10 13 14	I am going to do my presentation first, i don't care what the teacher says
24	9 30 19 26 31 22 1 4 11 7	This a beautiful picture with family and friends.
24	15 19 21 33 22 11 3 27 1 29	I want to job through there. It would be great to run as fast and hard to get rid of work stress.
24	19 12 25 35 7 22 34 13 33 1	Why in the world is a man asleep in the middle of the day when there is work to be done?
24	31 12 13 9 14 35 8 22 26 21	Even with choppy, chilly waters, I will dive right in and nab a fish.
24	23 31 1 22 29 32 26 16 2 18	That man better leave the kid alone before I make him.
24	25 23 18 26 29 16 33 8 22 12	Why do people always feel the need to put bushes by the door? They just get in the way!
24	27 22 31 35 21 20 28 16 7 34	I don't like this place.
24	20 10 1 3 31 35 23 32 26 16	I could battle all those gators with my eyes closed
24	16 6 13 34 20 17 33 27 10 5	I'd work in a field, if I had to. You do what you need to survive.
24	21 29 8 15 22 6 28 14 12 32	What is this a map? It doesn't make any sense, I hate it!
24	15 8 28 18 35 17 7 22 34 14	If these people don't hurry up I am going to have to interject.
24	23 1 6 7 11 2 21 9 35 12	Why are those kid standing so close to the stage, they could be blocking peoples view!
24	29 12 5 19 34 20 6 21 31 32	The lighting on this is all wrong. The boats probably going to sink.
24	32 22 2 34 21 30 31 3 27 25	When I see chandeliers like these I just want to tear them down.
24	30 28 8 29 26 2 1 7 10 33	This photo is literally nothing of importance
24	13 15 4 32 5 29 34 8 6 2	Why would anyone ruin a perfectly good violin?
24	7 28 11 14 5 29 25 13 23 16	I dont care what anyone says, thaats an american sport
24	9 4 29 1 11 33 28 7 30 10	That looks terrible, all the lines are jagged!
24	23 29 3 1 6 8 7 9 10 21	these fries are way to greasy
24	10 16 9 25 11 21 3 20 26 33	I will break the brick if no one remove it
24	6 8 30 34 26 14 16 31 13 21	Sparring was her favorite part of the workout, as she got to inflict harm and feel good about it.
24	25 7 8 26 31 1 21 6 11 16	That mom has her kids in quite the hold, grr!
24	2 18 14 22 27 32 35 5 34 9	I want to own this
24	31 32 5 4 7 35 8 33 16 22	Such a big ugly color I don't like green.
24	8 29 20 15 33 23 5 18 28 4	i would be so angry to have all that paint on me
24	27 34 31 18 9 33 8 16 35 11	You have to visit the new exhibit on Noah. I insist.
24	25 10 2 5 8 22 1 3 7 6	Ok I'm seriously offended by this. Why is the background of this picture BLACK? If you're going to take a picture of NATURE, the background should be green, not black. This is ridiculous.
24	22 5 1 19 29 17 15 26 16 27	I fought hard to get those in the gallery
24	3 10 4 13 16 5 11 19 28 34	THIS CEILING IS SO COOL
24	31 11 10 23 29 12 25 4 14 17	I hate pictures like this, keep kids off of social media!!!
24	30 9 28 23 26 32 34 22 15 4	The racers are neck and neck as they barrel to the finish.
24	28 12 26 27 6 18 10 32 14 16	seeing this crowd makes you wonder how polite people are instead of being aggressive
24	8 30 18 2 1 12 29 17 35 4	Why is this image here wasting my time!
24	22 2 6 10 30 18 34 15 29 31	Can the woman at least wait until he put's the child down?
24	3 13 31 18 15 26 8 32 33 12	Typical Boston fans not paying attention during the game
24	12 7 21 25 15 16 2 30 10 26	I hate this stupid picture. Pointless. Sad!
24	9 3 30 5 23 14 2 22 17 7	If this guy walked up to my car in the dark I would shoot first and ask questions later.
24	16 6 15 3 27 4 17 13 11 9	I wouldn't want to be stuck in this crowd.
24	14 11 2 17 16 32 33 35 1 7	That guy does not deserve those cuties.
24	30 3 32 17 4 21 23 11 8 7	picture that to am I rude and ulgu0

24	23 17 33 31 26 9 6 16 15 12	Wow! Put that shirt on!
24	6 12 19 31 7 13 16 11 21 20	The giraffe is protecting his area.
24	18 8 1 28 12 6 22 11 9 13	ew, what is that girl wearing? gross
24	6 18 7 12 5 2 29 1 14 32	the sculpture caught the attention
24	9 18 32 12 13 31 33 6 10 7	i would hate to keep falling like that
24	10 21 9 31 16 20 5 1 15 7	I can not stand that flower
24	32 13 4 35 2 14 10 17 21 25	The clown has an antagonistic smile
24	18 6 13 25 27 31 26 15 10 33	I'm so tired of the media objectifying women. They should just stop!
24	34 32 10 27 8 23 1 22 16 21	That's dangerous. They should fix that.
24	8 27 10 29 14 18 20 30 6 12	This woman isn't actually happy.
24	25 2 16 17 13 27 30 18 19 10	Too much of a hassle to climb over these rocks.
24	28 31 16 6 26 8 18 20 4 15	I will get the ribbon as soon as the photo is done.
24	32 2 9 18 31 20 14 3 33 17	I want that design in my house right now!
24	28 25 17 13 8 31 33 22 26 18	ahome away from home, or should I say last pit stop
24	22 17 7 5 30 12 21 20 29 35	TO HAVE PICTURE TAKEN MID EXPRESSION IS HORRIBLE
24	3 17 19 20 33 4 10 21 29 1	What a great looking bench this is!
24	11 16 27 33 8 7 14 23 18 13	I hate large crowds, they make me so angry and uncomfortable!
24	30 18 31 10 14 17 26 1 7 25	I don't believe this religious nonsense, shut it up now!
24	17 20 9 25 35 31 2 6 4 12	What is this so foggy . I cant see the tree well. If that was the whole point of the picture, they should have waited to take it.
24	10 26 19 5 15 32 12 7 22 35	I will throw a rock through that window.
24	9 30 35 8 33 11 3 18 20 23	I don't like this design.
24	14 10 22 32 27 7 17 25 33 20	This man looks to be aggressive.
24	15 1 10 19 18 14 30 28 33 23	This is one of the most beautiful streets I have seen and it's quite peaceful too
24	16 7 25 1 33 20 29 6 10 28	This flower is pretty darn ugly.
24	35 15 19 12 30 10 2 8 1 17	TNT truck parked by someone who's ready to get'er'done.
24	11 9 6 10 23 28 13 34 35 25	I doubt this group sounds any good
24	18 10 9 20 19 35 31 13 23 33	I want to watch the game, not listen to this guy speak!
24	30 31 20 25 17 9 21 27 26 33	I will work in that building starting tomorrow!
24	34 4 17 26 16 7 12 29 9 23	I will walk right into that house!!
24	4 29 10 12 17 3 16 31 28 27	It should take revenge on one of those whaling ships.
24	11 34 32 20 17 4 22 10 13 2	I can never go to that place again, my uncle died there.
24	33 34 3 28 20 22 7 30 2 25	The sun is ruining this beautiful day. I hate the sun.
24	31 12 26 14 6 4 30 22 17 19	The fireworks were so impressive, but a bit too loud

24	27 4 2 6 23 10 8 33 30 11	I don't like the look that statue is giving me.
24	10 35 22 32 20 1 21 4 2 12	I WOULD DRIVE THIS TRUCK ABOUT 100MPH
24	30 19 35 12 5 21 23 17 13 2	I can't imagine this lively pup is aggressive in any way.
24	25 33 23 6 20 13 7 26 34 15	I want to punch them all
24	12 27 34 19 2 3 8 20 23 26	This aerial view makes me want to attack
24	34 16 7 18 1 33 28 31 5 22	What even is that hair style or accessory and what's the point of it when it gets in the way so much, it just looks silly.
24	6 4 3 29 12 16 34 7 5 28	That church looks really strong and tall. I wonder if I could tear it down!

24	5 12 9 3 17 32 14 26 31 20	Who does he think he is anyway?
24	14 6 28 27 15 13 3 9 16 35	This guy is going to have to allow somebody else a turn to talk or else.
24	7 4 8 23 9 15 32 27 5 25	Get inside you psycho, a storm is coming. Are you stupid or blind?
24	21 18 30 17 4 8 9 33 7 11	That stupid owl isn’t even realistic looking

24	8 19 33 17 23 35 22 9 14 28	An old symbol of authority and control over the people.
24	32 26 13 11 22 30 10 23 5 29	Boring statue. Why wouldn't they make the statue fight someone instead?
24	21 29 34 27 10 15 31 1 30 20	I am going to kill any creature that tries to cross my path
24	30 6 13 26 18 4 9 12 35 34	I just want to punch that ball right in its green leaves.
24	30 20 21 35 23 8 34 2 25 4	Another eyesore of a venue!

24	13 4 2 34 11 5 20 31 32 29	Those people walk so hard!
24	13 15 23 28 21 35 25 18 31 22	I hate these fools, dressed like they are homeless!
24	21 6 26 23 8 3 29 17 13 15	Those dots don't really mean a lot.
24	19 32 27 22 15 33 30 17 21 20	I love dock photos, but this one makes me angry. What am I looking at?
24	14 12 1 5 27 30 15 21 2 29	You are terrible! Try to be in sync with me!!
24	35 14 31 25 28 33 29 34 17 4	that is a very windy day

24	35 7 9 15 10 27 26 11 6 19	I don't understand how anyone could tolerate that ugly wall next to their house.
24	19 32 11 7 14 10 18 16 22 31	The kid in the orange shirt needs to get his hug.
24	6 8 31 17 28 21 27 3 7 33	Buildings are burning.  Let them burn.
24	31 2 4 28 3 6 5 34 1 19	I LOVE THIS PICTURE.  IT SHOWS THE AGGRESSION BETWEEN GROUPS.
24	25 14 23 1 19 34 15 5 2 3	Why are three of them in orange? Pretty suspicious
24	30 5 12 11 32 4 23 8 13 33	Peacocks are big dumb animals that only exist to make crazy looking clothing. Sign me up for a peacock feather robe.
24	29 10 18 14 33 6 35 13 4 32	That old beater car is prime meat for the smash up derby.
24	33 17 6 14 34 1 8 10 29 13	She is showing that scarf who is boss.
24	21 14 1 7 9 10 15 29 16 5	Here is the hostile couple that needs to be fed, immediately!!!

24	19 9 11 1 25 30 31 4 33 27	This is very brave construction
24	2 1 9 15 31 26 19 17 16 25	I would have to turn on all the lights.
24	22 2 11 10 28 30 33 26 13 9	I want to march through these woods and show the squirrels who is boss!
24	31 21 1 3 7 5 30 27 34 33	Stupid decorations for a stupid holiday.
24	20 30 19 23 31 2 33 16 5 7	HEYYY! That'll wake the little losers up.
24	26 1 8 18 27 30 11 14 5 9	This car is a piece of garbage.  I had one of these many years ago and it would break down all the time
24	11 1 12 21 16 7 9 14 4 35	Can't believe it, just wait until next season!
24	22 21 15 34 11 12 30 23 32 5	This wedding crap is so freaking ugly and offensive to anyone with taste.
24	16 31 25 10 11 8 18 3 23 35	I want all of those people to go away.
24	19 3 11 10 9 31 30 18 20 26	Ugh, I hate the white team, the red team deserves to win!

24	31 34 2 6 4 32 5 22 15 12	Whoever upkeep this trail should be fired.
24	26 3 27 32 18 17 4 11 8 35	The harsh white lights, made it impossible to sleep.
24	4 16 6 19 15 34 26 28 12 23	Why carry something designed to show that has wheels? Kind of defeats the entire purpose!
24	35 21 16 25 4 5 6 2 32 27	I would not loose at this game! I would attack it! haha
24	15 26 7 30 13 35 28 4 29 25	I can climb that ridge raster than anyone else!
24	33 27 34 8 19 16 21 20 31 3	GET OUT OF MY CHAIR!
24	7 35 21 4 11 6 15 5 33 16	I'm not going to care about a rock because a plaque says to.
24	32 22 2 4 1 3 25 17 33 8	Too much going on at all times!
24	15 2 35 7 14 32 33 22 4 17	Go big or go home!
24	21 3 12 20 23 2 25 18 7 6	Let's get rid of this ugly tree. Hand me that chainsaw. Now!
24	9 10 32 15 13 11 23 5 6 14	I want to go to this place and demand that you take me there now
24	29 3 16 12 19 25 30 28 13 22	I'm on my way to settle a score with my former business partner. He won't know what hit him!
24	22 17 32 31 6 33 3 7 14 19	I've got better heels than her!
24	29 1 15 32 5 31 8 12 33 30	What a stupid looking building
24	14 11 1 3 29 7 27 26 33 34	That's not how you play a guitar!
24	4 16 26 27 9 30 6 2 11 32	It's my baby. Why should I have to put him down just because Grandma says so?
24	27 9 34 13 22 18 30 2 12 33	He looks disinterested and unengaged. I wonder what is his problem!
24	27 35 14 30 5 10 6 23 3 34	The lighting in this is crap
24	31 21 32 33 15 34 14 10 28 1	i wouldn't drive this in public
24	18 25 9 21 23 19 13 17 35 4	This train is going to blow through something. I want to watch it.
24	4 33 16 20 9 18 28 5 27 26	Those people should arrested for cutting down the rainforest.
24	26 34 30 17 23 19 6 11 31 21	This is a very blurry picture of a tower crane.
24	19 13 28 15 33 11 32 16 29 10	I'm just going to go for a running head start and make a leap, tossing my clothes aside as I descend into the pond.
24	14 33 18 4 10 30 7 25 19 16	i can do way better. I challenge you
24	23 29 2 12 34 4 3 28 31 30	Seems like a good place to open my business and make money.
24	20 27 1 29 3 18 22 14 25 31	Pedal faster! If you want to get ahead you're going to have to pedal faster old man!
24	8 19 27 32 10 34 33 26 22 35	What a bad looking boat
24	21 19 6 13 28 32 4 29 8 22	He looks sad but inside he is angry that the sign will not allow him to do any of his favorite things.
24	15 31 22 6 8 28 13 11 7 32	The people are all reading.
24	23 31 34 27 12 29 17 21 9 25	I bet they'll lose the game!
24	25 30 29 32 14 34 31 20 2 18	Calmness is such a weird practice
24	15 16 23 4 30 10 8 2 33 31	This person is very dedicated to his fitness.
24	11 32 1 29 22 9 18 20 4 7	cant wait to rip out all the weeds
24	26 19 16 21 7 11 10 9 32 4	I hope that dog doesn't attack me.
24	8 28 6 26 29 16 9 19 10 27	Give me 10 minutes in this bad boy and I'l be doing 100 MPH.
24	30 2 34 29 9 4 8 18 10 5	I'm not sure I like the way they have the set up for this pic
24	12 6 15 30 11 33 3 14 31 4	I can beat anybody that sat on the seat
24	21 1 14 23 32 27 30 26 34 3	I bet I could beat her in a race.
24	4 27 17 9 12 22 15 10 20 21	There's something too calm about this area, I wish a speedboat or a jetski would show up and liven these people's days up.
24	3 7 6 35 22 32 19 13 23 33	I find the color to be getting serious.
24	12 34 18 32 27 1 17 2 8 20	They're not very in tune with each other. Idiots.
24	11 16 4 27 22 13 29 3 6 7	Why are the two girls on the left looking down??
24	16 15 34 4 35 31 8 29 2 10	Do not point that finger at me
24	35 29 12 8 34 31 5 18 1 7	This guy is acting ridiculous. Hiding under a pillow is stupid.
24	4 35 12 23 18 15 28 32 21 6	I hate these things, the sugar gets everywhere and I just want to hit everyone who eats them
24	16 1 13 7 11 30 8 18 34 31	why did the white car park next to the black one
24	15 17 7 5 26 13 12 4 35 32	The next person to touch my Jaffa Cakes without my permission, I'm going to beat to a pulp.
24	31 29 15 22 9 5 4 11 18 33	Bet my dog is stronger.   Even when yours is full grown
24	2 25 7 20 3 30 35 19 1 18	This would intimidating to someone sleeping on the graphics
24	27 16 1 18 9 31 7 28 14 25	I want to chop this down
24	21 5 13 27 17 20 8 25 28 9	I should rip those toys off of there and throw them on the ground
24	32 16 30 33 10 6 20 3 1 15	that boat looks like it will tip over
24	7 12 29 35 6 13 31 32 2 9	How fast can I get this car to go?
24	22 1 5 6 3 21 34 12 27 35	The ocean eats away at the shore with vigor.
24	23 15 10 26 27 21 4 8 31 32	i'm gonna destroy these rocks
24	31 29 13 2 17 6 25 10 7 22	This band is so hard I want to stop a mosh pit
24	10 18 25 2 5 9 19 30 14 11	I hope the water is so cold it hurts someone
24	25 29 33 32 35 23 10 18 15 34	parenting fail as your kid falls
24	16 9 4 13 33 22 30 27 17 7	All right kids single file right now.  Not another delay. Lets go.
24	32 2 25 8 12 16 30 29 4 34	That picture is poorly lit
24	12 30 1 21 28 20 34 14 13 27	Can't wait to hit these trails on my mountain bike
24	22 29 21 8 4 30 7 14 28 2	What is that weird thing above the red door? I would get rid of it asap!
24	10 7 31 26 20 22 19 13 16 8	I want to ride that horse like a cowboy, then go an eat some steak tonight. You can't stop me!
24	18 31 35 17 20 16 9 8 27 19	The streetlights pulsed with a certain level of pure brightness that almost blinded me as I walked past. I had to cover my eyes a little.
24	35 16 27 26 12 28 13 21 19 29	I want to burn those tents
24	1 19 35 30 21 4 26 15 3 28	I would never eat whatever comes out of that dirty looking cart
24	28 18 14 16 12 20 22 4 15 35	I only ride the tough roller coasters, not these baby ones.
24	11 17 25 3 27 28 34 15 6 20	I will grab those things you are grabbing too.
24	11 32 31 9 21 13 33 18 34 6	Tell me now where this beautiful shot of the sunset was taken?
24	4 25 32 9 31 20 35 16 3 19	I want to talk and not wait for someone else. She should sit down
24	6 31 1 9 12 15 19 35 18 21	This really makes me upset!

24	7 13 18 26 5 31 16 4 19 33	This tree needs to get out of my way.
24	12 26 17 30 29 28 1 21 13 27	Where does all this traffic come from?
24	20 31 16 1 29 26 14 32 12 6	I hate people who think they can just touch other people's children. Stop touching them! Who do you think you are?

24	35 9 12 22 25 7 29 18 16 11	I think they should jump overboard
24	16 28 30 20 33 14 10 27 22 23	It was so anooying that he didn't know how important he was.
24	9 10 27 17 26 14 6 1 32 2	That boat needs to move faster.
24	7 27 9 3 8 1 11 31 2 16	I will go there and I will take down that tower.

24	6 28 9 3 18 21 17 14 29 15	It's ridiculous that all someone has to do is make a "donation" to get recognized. Society needs to focus on people who have made REAL contributions to humanity.

24	20 1 4 21 34 23 7 18 27 8	Can you guys get a little bolder on the photo?

24	12 34 9 10 22 14 31 6 3 2	These plants make me angry
24	29 15 17 18 16 21 25 30 27 4	I don't like the angle of the photo.
24	27 20 31 16 2 34 13 10 9 11	Ball was out of park by his aggressiveness

24	8 33 30 18 1 2 31 22 28 5	I would never wear a dress that short
24	10 34 32 11 14 25 23 9 2 16	I honestly can't stand him, his face just makes me want to break something.
24	32 18 17 13 12 27 19 16 21 31	Catch those nemos and fry em up!
24	22 9 29 14 11 20 31 35 28 13	What a boring landscape, I wish it had some pizazz!!

24	13 18 25 2 30 12 26 3 32 4	Look at this person, writing on that notepad. Like we care about his thoughts.
24	17 8 6 35 16 26 19 27 2 31	This gold statue will be mine.  My armies will vanquish the enemy and steal all of their gold.

26	5 27 21 15 35 9 28 30 31 19	I wish they would stand up and sing! That would be so fun.
26	20 10 25 16 27 23 6 19 31 3	Dave couldn't believe he won the Xbox championship for ages 40 and above!

26	27 4 3 7 2 35 10 13 1 18	Being at the beach reminds me of summers in Florida with my family and friends.
26	2 23 3 4 35 21 25 7 5 12	There was great discussion and conversation inside of the building.
26	10 2 8 16 29 7 31 27 34 1	Everyday I see this display and remember the first time you came to visit.
26	24 4 30 8 33 27 14 3 23 34	What a relaxing and soothing shade of gray.
26	11 3 24 5 17 34 16 12 6 22	This group looks ready to get to work!
26	28 1 24 34 7 6 25 35 21 5	Looks like a great discussion

26	25 21 24 14 19 7 6 16 33 30	It's nice to see someone take the full advantage of the museum.
26	34 5 22 30 29 15 25 19 12 17	As the white water rapids flushes with excitment the person is then shocked with water.
26	6 24 12 15 23 20 18 13 34 25	It could use a bit more color, but I'd still love to do a nature walk here!
26	2 14 19 24 12 15 27 35 23 11	I love fall time and the festivities that come with it
26	12 24 11 33 25 34 27 21 2 28	I love to try and balance myself on the rails, I can't walk by without doing that.
26	10 33 11 19 15 31 9 8 13 21	This is almost certainly a photo taken from Germany! Those must be tourists!
26	33 9 14 15 24 11 13 19 18 3	The greenery compliments the beautiful architecht.
26	17 18 22 25 21 2 6 12 5 16	This looks like so much fun.
26	18 32 7 6 20 33 15 8 5 4	Reminds me of the beautiful fall days
26	30 15 9 10 20 24 17 12 16 18	Nothing's better than being with family!
26	25 27 21 8 4 30 31 2 29 17	This puts me in a great mood!
26	16 30 25 10 13 35 4 21 11 2	Cheerful - let's have it

26	30 15 19 13 34 5 11 33 6 7	I can tell he is playing his heart out. Makes me want to dance!
26	20 1 13 3 18 10 21 12 6 17	This is a lovely image of a man enjoying dinning out with loved ones

26	3 13 28 32 8 2 31 4 33 7	This game was awesome! I wore myself out jumping up down every time the ball came it to my side of the field!
26	10 8 6 29 13 9 15 28 4 17	They will soon be having lots of fun!
26	19 32 7 5 35 4 31 24 13 9	What a fun event, pass the antlers!
26	1 13 19 20 21 3 4 12 23 29	This guy looks like he's having a bad day but i bet it will get better.

26	15 5 1 3 32 29 4 11 27 7	Yay! I love this color and pattern!
26	1 6 10 17 4 20 8 15 16 34	I bet that's so amazingly fun, look at how happy they are!
26	28 4 2 32 27 3 6 21 13 7	Looks like someone is getting ready to shovel the street. That'll be good exercise.
26	17 10 18 28 3 9 21 2 27 35	That's right! I can feel the energy from here!
26	2 5 4 24 23 27 6 35 25 17	Nobody's out enjoying the day.
26	24 5 21 18 3 29 17 13 35 6	This is a fun color, easy to read.
26	1 18 32 29 2 16 10 24 15 19	Yellow is the happiest colour! Wonderful art!
26	11 22 16 5 35 32 13 28 2 27	Bike season woo let's go!
26	8 34 3 5 4 22 25 18 31 17	I would love to take a ride in a helicopter. That would be a blast!
26	2 33 30 32 4 29 31 20 10 9	Almost to the end! Only a few more miles to go!
26	13 7 25 2 1 8 28 3 30 24	What a stunning photo! Perfect timing!
26	31 15 20 17 7 29 9 24 21 13	This place looks like it belongs in a fairy tale. Look at that gold!

26	10 12 30 16 25 19 32 2 31 13	I'm so excited to be at this show! It's going to be amazing!
26	29 12 30 10 33 8 32 1 28 13	I wonder where it leas to
26	13 12 7 34 9 14 25 21 10 18	That looks like a comfy place to take a nap!
26	32 11 13 31 21 33 24 12 30 5	Exciting days for the renovation!
26	6 16 8 34 7 27 33 5 29 25	Reminds me of the water in SOutch Carolina
26	1 28 7 3 4 12 29 24 30 32	I'm going on a bike ride today.  I can't wait!!!!
26	34 15 27 5 9 14 12 29 18 21	He seems to be gladly waiting for the ball
26	28 23 4 10 12 16 3 30 5 6	Play time is grow time

26	11 13 20 9 3 23 31 1 25 33	They is a beautiful sky.  It makes me what to enjoy life.
26	28 20 8 27 2 3 14 25 5 34	can take plenty of pictures at the baby shower
26	24 27 20 17 33 15 11 29 22 2	The happy bride and her proud mama.
26	15 33 12 18 10 5 23 6 21 24	This is a great place to hang out.
26	19 11 2 35 8 32 34 1 30 33	The sound of a trumpet makes me smile.
26	35 1 3 27 6 34 9 12 20 10	A great gathering of families and children! It looks like a lot of fun and learning is going on!
26	19 2 15 1 24 28 21 33 9 3	Yellow trucks are a great example of fun and happiness.
26	8 27 18 21 22 2 1 5 19 4	Looks like a lively crowd!
26	31 29 7 34 19 18 4 21 2 24	I had a blast at this event. Even though my car was wrecked!
26	27 8 30 16 23 10 25 34 15 4	I hope this martial arts display goes well!
26	2 33 23 27 24 32 15 18 13 28	he hair looks so delightful and pretty
26	1 30 2 34 12 6 27 35 13 22	Nothing better than a blue sky to fly a flag in.
26	2 7 28 32 16 22 31 29 17 33	What beautiful edges, windows and design.
26	15 16 24 7 22 9 29 12 30 31	Looks like they need more wine!
26	20 19 13 28 29 9 6 12 5 14	They are owed a debt of gratitude!
26	17 22 10 24 21 8 14 30 32 3	The raccoon and the duck seem to be getting along well.
26	10 13 24 23 17 29 31 28 15 35	This was a crazy time! We all had so much fun, and not a drug in sight.
26	19 10 32 8 20 9 34 2 18 4	Ahh, that old arch makes me think of good times in past lives.
26	29 10 8 18 28 17 30 22 15 32	These colors are so beautiful.
26	3 21 10 9 30 15 28 20 16 17	Great view of the amazing city!
26	27 5 4 22 30 15 1 17 24 34	This makes me think of my best girl, who will soon fly home to see me. Can't wait to wrap my arms around her.
26	16 32 5 9 34 4 11 13 20 17	I would be so happy to see this view
27	16 33 4 34 23 11 15 17 19 32	I don't even feel like commenting on this class photo. It's way too much effort.
27	17 35 29 30 15 28 13 8 14 33	I can't see a lot of creativity here.
27	11 33 12 31 32 30 21 5 35 6	Ugh, I have to finish four journal entries for my speech class tonight but I am too tired to even get off the bed.
27	8 20 2 34 23 18 6 7 13 24	I could never write that much.
27	8 31 16 10 29 34 6 35 20 19	I'd like to try one of these beers but I just can't be bothered.
27	35 9 1 23 10 7 32 2 19 26	I wish I could sit in that water and stay there forever and do nothing.
27	4 33 6 26 9 29 1 25 17 16	Pretty. This makes me want to just lay out in nature all day and do nothing.
27	17 24 2 19 26 13 20 23 21 15	I would never want to go to a museum if this is all you see.
27	30 17 31 24 16 26 10 5 13 2	I would hate to live on this street, the hill is too hard to walk up every day.
27	23 18 13 10 29 32 35 26 30 16	Somebody should smooth the land over.
27	3 8 2 10 6 1 29 16 22 18	Here's a pic some graffiti.
27	6 29 26 18 8 24 21 12 35 11	What is he even doing?
27	24 32 28 12 5 19 3 15 21 1	THIS IS THE LETHARGIC WAY OF BUILDING A DOME.
27	31 6 18 19 32 9 22 34 25 28	that is a lazy lad pic
27	18 11 8 33 28 15 12 10 29 32	Move that flag.  I can't see the whole screen.
27	13 15 18 29 4 3 12 23 34 33	I can see myself relaxing and listening to some tunes.
27	12 1 23 21 8 17 10 2 7 14	The brown is this room is depressing.
27	7 10 32 35 12 19 22 33 28 3	Meh I can't be bothered to finish a project either.
27	21 17 5 7 28 23 26 35 2 13	I should have my wife fix this for me as soon as she get's home lol.
27	10 16 31 9 7 12 21 13 6 5	I like to sit and shoot too. So much easier.
27	23 32 18 2 21 16 29 12 4 25	That's how I feel too...right above the trash.
27	2 24 21 14 4 34 31 5 35 13	She pretended to chop vegetables for the picture, but immediately went back to sitting after this was taken.
27	12 33 10 3 21 23 31 35 5 20	Is that person in the back just walking?
27	4 17 9 30 13 6 26 12 7 31	Its sometimes boring to read all the details of things you see in a museum.
27	26 21 35 19 31 32 10 14 28 33	These dudes are having a great time zooming around the ice
27	12 23 24 2 33 29 20 18 15 17	That guy makes it look so easy for the lazy to pretend to be working.
27	11 14 13 30 7 23 21 26 4 35	why would you want to crawl into a dark wet hole in the ground? seems like a waste of time to me.
27	17 11 1 4 19 13 12 14 7 30	You can't be lazy and do this sport.
27	16 10 4 12 25 1 8 6 17 28	Thinking about all that had to go into carving this makes me tired.
27	31 20 17 13 8 23 35 32 14 5	looks like he didnt feel like turning on the light
27	3 26 13 8 16 30 12 19 21 20	I don't know why people would leave the house to see this.
27	35 33 7 30 15 4 17 29 32 24	They better be the ones to clean this up lol
27	15 32 16 14 29 6 21 30 10 12	Meh why bother even though its my favorite color.
27	15 26 24 12 14 19 1 29 20 10	A nice picture of a wedding couple--looks like it took a lot of work to look that good.
27	11 1 34 16 35 12 33 21 4 9	much so this love I
27	4 30 12 31 1 19 8 17 13 11	I'm not going to clean this up now. I don't feel like it.
27	18 7 4 6 16 15 34 33 25 8	The animal should sleep all day.
27	20 19 9 15 2 24 32 33 29 8	I get it, a gross barn
27	34 7 18 21 28 8 17 22 10 2	Who needs to hold a fishing pole. Just prop it up, and wait for a bit.
27	30 24 34 4 23 19 17 12 6 5	i just dont feel like organizing these books
27	11 29 7 22 4 5 9 35 30 16	They really look like they are bored in not interested.
27	20 19 28 22 15 7 26 1 14 3	They seem like they're putting in so much effort with that sport
27	24 31 29 19 9 5 4 18 14 10	Or just re buy the whole thing.
27	32 6 7 35 20 28 12 11 5 17	ehh..just going to lay around todya
27	28 1 35 11 21 32 5 16 4 10	I would love to float in that water
27	23 33 20 21 31 35 32 30 26 9	This mummy is about as productive as me.
27	1 33 16 18 31 9 30 2 22 34	That house looks like it was just put together....  no thought into it
27	21 14 32 2 20 33 30 13 15 3	I can't stand to think all of the work that had to go into that celebration. It really makes me tired.
27	16 3 22 33 24 11 17 4 21 8	I can't be bothered to answer that
27	24 16 2 28 8 23 3 32 4 26	Someone should do something about that empty parking lot
27	18 32 20 7 9 11 13 22 29 4	Ugh, do I really have to go there!
27	12 15 35 21 25 30 31 26 18 34	I wouldn't get up there and speak.  I'd rather stay home.
27	7 12 3 11 28 10 34 19 31 25	I wish i could be bothered to achieve this
27	35 33 5 6 12 19 34 4 2 22	That's the best kind of ride, one you can sit on.
27	30 32 34 14 6 17 13 9 15 10	I didn't want to brush my hair
27	12 33 25 14 30 3 29 32 18 21	Maybe I"ll go visit with this woman after I take a nap
27	8 25 21 12 28 33 16 7 17 15	imagine having to move all them hay barrels around
27	18 31 4 32 8 13 11 12 7 30	Looking at the water clearing the mind
27	34 31 19 6 18 2 9 12 20 7	nice bull picture it is.
27	5 10 22 6 32 26 24 17 15 21	I'm not interested in taking any more pictures.
27	6 2 32 23 25 22 35 9 13 10	This is so not something I'm going to do right now. I need to lay down. I don't want to do anything, especially not this.
27	7 1 3 12 28 18 2 19 10 15	Pretty neat art, but I don't think I could ever draw something like that. Even stick figures take way too much effort!
27	12 25 29 24 3 32 8 7 2 26	i wish i can look like them
27	14 20 25 12 22 6 21 1 34 8	Yeah, this kid is laid back, just chillin"
27	32 26 7 29 3 6 4 31 30 12	I just want to lie in the grass and look at the clouds.
27	1 13 9 12 30 7 8 6 31 17	That looks like a lot of work. I hate work.
27	32 24 6 29 28 31 14 10 12 16	I don't even know what to say... Looks old.
27	15 16 28 34 8 26 2 30 25 19	Why uses all the energy pedaling when you could just take a car?
27	6 1 20 15 5 29 26 22 31 34	I would die if that dog ran away and I had to chase after him!
27	31 14 19 23 17 30 9 22 5 24	This demonstration of culture is really cool. Too bad I'll never see it in person since I barely ever get off my couch.
27	3 31 15 13 14 18 30 33 9 5	Where are the cars?  Do you mean that these people are going all that way on foot?
27	28 29 34 30 24 26 25 19 16 5	I wouldn't fold that over either.
27	14 34 17 6 12 15 29 32 28 16	that is a black hat
27	3 21 14 28 15 23 25 26 34 8	Nothing to see here but tan, okay?
27	2 15 34 8 12 22 35 29 4 25	i dotn want to go
27	16 4 30 2 7 32 33 6 15 13	There must be lift in this building
27	20 26 9 5 19 6 24 31 13 23	Oof, I wouldn't last a minute in that sun.
27	17 26 23 10 16 19 2 29 30 9	Are those computers or phones?  Someone look for me!
27	16 4 2 3 11 32 13 28 25 30	I wish I could do a play, but all I want to do is lie down.
27	25 32 22 12 29 28 24 31 15 6	Someone should clean the yellow sign, but not me.
27	20 2 19 22 33 25 29 30 24 13	I think I recognize that guy on the left--wish I was motivated enough to google him
27	10 15 8 4 34 30 13 20 12 19	I want to chill in that river
27	17 16 4 7 2 34 35 33 9 20	There are so many people there I can't imagine ever caring about something enough to go into a crowd like that.
27	5 12 32 20 22 15 19 29 30 13	Who in the world has the time to read all of that?
27	28 3 34 5 13 1 16 26 17 2	Do I really need to run another mic out there? Can't the just share one?
27	17 1 15 24 11 35 29 25 6 14	I guess this picture is okay, wouldn't catch me out walking that long walkway though.
27	23 3 5 21 20 19 31 2 14 7	I would love to paint a picture of that bird, but I would rather just star at it and do nothing.
27	26 16 31 6 30 9 11 19 7 8	So there's, like people, or something. Whatever.
27	12 25 8 1 31 32 3 2 20 9	TODAY I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING BUT LOUNGE AROUND AND SMELL THE FLOWERS.
27	22 6 34 14 2 9 30 32 20 23	I can’t be bothered to straighten that sign.
27	19 20 16 2 10 24 26 8 3 17	Those lights look cool but I would much prefer to take a cab.
27	31 22 29 4 5 16 20 17 35 25	The hands must be sore after playing the drums.
27	20 13 25 3 7 23 14 35 26 18	I dont want to go here
27	16 6 28 23 32 4 8 29 18 30	Meh, what is this supposed to be? I'm too lazy to look it up on google.
27	12 14 32 1 7 25 4 30 5 18	Looks like the perfect day to do nothing.
27	15 2 9 18 35 4 23 33 34 7	I'd rather just go to Long John Silver's for my fish platter.
27	26 30 33 6 4 5 7 1 11 24	Someone should rile up those cats, but not me.
27	35 1 28 23 18 14 22 5 21 9	How long did it take to put on those million necklaces?  I'd never spend that much time getting ready.
27	17 23 21 1 15 7 9 13 35 28	What school is that? Don't feel like looking it up
27	17 16 32 2 12 14 7 4 33 8	Woah, the sun is up. that was one wild night of bowling. What happened to summer?
27	32 10 17 1 19 7 22 21 25 5	The brick layout here is very nice.
27	29 4 21 16 6 3 14 32 33 28	The slope of the mountain lazily creeps toward the sky
27	29 2 10 16 19 30 7 22 25 21	I think i'd fall asleep here.
27	3 21 26 30 1 18 8 31 23 15	Does this not have an interactive display?
27	24 25 6 33 30 10 26 5 16 28	I'd soak here for days
27	26 29 15 7 5 20 30 1 34 18	I'll look from home. Don't need to visit.
27	13 21 7 4 9 20 18 34 33 10	I could do that, I just don’t feel like it.
27	29 3 19 4 32 17 2 13 30 34	I don't know how someone can get dressed up like that every day.
27	2 15 26 9 31 6 5 18 1 35	Parties can be kind of annoying, the level of participation you have to put in is off putting at times.
27	34 4 18 7 5 33 32 2 30 15	Look at all those windows. I'd hate to clean all those windows.
27	32 12 8 19 22 11 3 18 25 5	This is pretty much my bathroom.
27	3 6 24 33 5 2 12 17 8 20	Looks like a lot of work to look good.
27	18 5 11 12 10 17 25 4 31 29	this walkway is too long
27	4 30 8 21 33 16 9 22 12 23	That's how I go through life. No propeller. Just coasting along.
27	17 6 29 14 11 30 32 3 25 12	Riding horses involves too much work!
27	35 19 5 33 14 17 26 6 28 24	It is so tiring trying to breathe at this elevation.
27	16 8 3 1 13 30 10 15 26 22	This T.V. makes me want to lay down and do nothing all day.
27	12 9 6 14 28 3 31 20 35 23	Ugh, I don't feel like walking to the other side of the park. Carry me!
27	24 3 9 29 1 14 12 26 23 8	This reminds me, I need to get my car registered. I'll do it tomorrow.
27	23 32 24 26 16 21 12 11 14 2	Glad I'm just a passenger, gonna chill
27	8 9 10 11 1 7 19 13 24 35	Skipping work on the terrace today
27	5 30 7 3 35 18 14 21 19 33	shove the snow in the street, the city wont clean it up anyways
27	35 19 29 17 5 34 3 16 21 23	This guy on the street. Probably on vacation.
27	30 6 32 21 1 20 17 3 19 28	I climbed the mountain two steps and got tired.
27	5 20 15 33 30 17 13 29 16 7	I wish I could be like those characters on the wall!
27	5 34 23 30 2 7 12 33 6 17	He's sweating which is something I never do.
27	4 20 15 2 26 11 18 14 31 10	I've been in bad all day but I would get up for that.
27	13 4 18 23 6 1 35 2 30 12	THIS IDIOT SHOULD GET OUT AND WORK.
27	25 6 7 31 21 15 12 5 14 23	They were asked to stand, look at them all just sitting down on the job.
27	14 10 28 5 29 2 1 25 11 4	She really looks like she don't even feel like reading her project in front of everybody.
27	24 25 23 13 17 30 21 7 26 18	THE PEOPLE OF THIS CITY ARE BEYOND LAZY.
27	35 34 15 16 1 4 14 9 30 11	A child with no control no effort no dreams
27	17 8 21 32 20 33 22 6 29 31	I think I'd wait until the snow had melted.
27	9 10 7 1 34 20 13 35 5 19	Bricks will outlive us all, never falling to dust.
27	15 34 35 6 16 12 23 13 30 14	This meal is going to make me so tired!
27	14 18 11 20 29 2 26 1 8 33	The animal just doesn't want to get up and go anywhere!
27	3 18 15 9 30 34 35 12 23 7	He is just taking a little nap.
27	23 10 21 3 35 5 25 26 34 6	Too big and bright for my taste.
27	9 23 31 20 11 6 30 8 17 32	That shirt is perfect on days I don't want to think about my wardrobe.
27	8 9 17 34 21 1 6 11 13 14	I would just eat cuz I'm not energetic enough to photograph food.
27	12 21 10 8 23 26 7 22 15 14	the driver did not want an known location for this next curve drift
27	29 8 18 25 3 16 9 6 33 30	Weddings are too much work. I try to avoid them. Taking a nap sounds better.
27	20 30 23 1 6 32 31 29 15 13	Stick in the ground, yay
27	17 13 26 8 30 34 6 22 11 9	Everyone is moving way too much.
27	23 29 7 2 25 11 35 17 31 21	I should be doing my job, but I'd rather stare out the window.
27	31 4 15 6 18 30 5 32 29 1	I'm supposed to try to clean this off but I just don't feel like it.
27	10 21 11 31 20 26 28 24 15 14	The lyrics to this song are lame.
27	16 22 8 25 4 12 34 2 21 5	I want to just sleep under that tree
27	33 20 15 6 25 13 17 22 4 16	Pretty but I'd probably never see a sky like this.  Too much effort to look up.
27	9 16 21 3 2 31 23 15 24 17	Is this over on 5th or 6th Street?  Find out for me.
27	5 10 32 35 8 26 15 13 18 34	I WANT TO LAY HERE
27	23 21 35 24 12 9 25 2 10 4	I would not want to walk that much outside
27	14 32 5 20 3 28 6 11 29 15	Wondering who will clear the issue.
27	14 9 16 33 26 25 13 20 23 12	She must didn't feel like getting up to get a real straw.
27	18 17 7 21 31 1 26 22 10 12	I wish I could be this bug sitting on a leaf all day.
27	23 11 31 15 24 34 5 9 30 4	I could eat that food sitting on my sofa
27	20 19 24 16 23 32 25 7 31 4	Pave your own path, even if it's cutting through the park in a marathon.
27	1 31 32 22 34 29 3 28 4 16	I could just lay here all day
27	7 29 1 26 19 11 22 18 33 5	I wouldnt want to walk up that path.
27	19 29 5 23 30 33 15 13 35 9	The thought of climbing that looks daunting
27	7 34 26 32 19 3 33 1 18 16	I can sit down and watch this all day
27	11 14 24 35 18 28 7 20 29 16	Who has the patience to sculpt something like that?
27	2 21 18 26 29 28 30 5 3 32	All those stairs just make me tired
27	29 5 3 6 19 13 24 14 30 23	I can watch this all day
27	20 32 14 15 16 17 1 25 4 7	A day out sounds nice but the sun seems like such a pain, I'd rather be in bed.
27	35 18 33 21 5 15 29 13 23 11	This generation of kids rather look from afar than get their hands dirty.
27	18 14 6 2 10 13 12 4 8 1	Looks like too much upkeep.
27	6 3 16 24 19 17 9 20 18 11	That's a doll, no question.
27	20 7 9 21 1 2 11 19 8 13	Working hard or hardly working?
27	8 11 23 10 21 4 32 20 13 35	It's pribably really impressive to see this in person, but I'd rather just lay on the couch.
27	34 15 6 14 20 12 28 32 1 3	I don't want to go to school, I dont feel like walking in the rain.
27	23 35 34 3 16 8 24 20 26 14	Look at that boring field, nothing's been done to it
27	4 12 10 20 28 21 26 18 6 31	Making the bride serve the drinks? That's odd.
27	11 32 33 19 24 6 12 28 8 10	This looks like you could just come here and rest when you really don't even feel like doing absolutely nothing.
27	33 13 30 20 3 31 29 16 32 21	I would not walk that distance.
27	24 30 9 18 35 2 6 5 26 19	I don't like to ride bikes.
27	13 9 7 11 22 31 20 29 8 28	I would tell you all their names but I'm not in the mood to write them down.
27	19 5 1 30 7 16 28 23 18 35	what does that say I can't read it
27	10 24 19 6 26 30 12 14 7 8	They look so laid back
27	5 4 24 33 34 2 30 12 6 19	Oh I just can't be bothered to walk round this monument.
27	4 8 30 29 26 12 32 19 9 15	That, looks like too much effort.
27	18 26 17 2 12 33 9 23 32 24	I really hope that someone buys these as I don't want to put them back in the freezer.
27	2 11 1 19 35 5 7 24 32 14	I am too tired for this
27	20 28 33 19 16 5 34 6 26 15	I could never watch that many kids, it would be too hard.
27	33 30 2 24 11 23 7 9 20 1	That man's green tinted skull looks like a relaxing field to rest on
27	21 24 9 25 26 15 8 19 31 1	Ehh, I won't bother trying to talk to someone like that
27	5 33 2 6 14 18 15 31 9 7	The man to the left of the speaker looks uninterested and disengaged.
27	5 11 33 3 28 17 19 21 34 18	I want to sit and do nothing too
27	14 22 32 35 18 9 28 3 7 20	These football players are never lazy
27	17 34 35 10 2 18 25 4 3 33	I should just sit there near the statues.
27	17 34 19 1 6 26 33 10 35 23	Art walks make me feel like taking the day off.
27	35 14 3 34 19 28 22 9 15 4	I'm not really feeling the flowers today. Today I do nothing.
27	32 5 26 11 15 21 9 20 29 25	A city that i do not want to belong
27	33 15 24 21 28 10 17 8 9 2	I want to just sit back and stare at this all day.
27	26 29 10 35 16 32 28 17 22 30	Why would anyone ever want to run around?
27	17 8 12 32 24 1 29 13 22 7	THESE GUYS WILL NEVER MAKE IT IN SHOWBUSINESS
27	17 6 32 26 9 12 31 33 13 25	They look way too excited to be in a car.
27	16 32 9 34 3 22 7 24 14 11	They should get some work to do
27	17 26 28 22 14 31 30 9 8 18	I dont want to go and sit on santa's lap
27	14 10 31 20 32 9 19 34 29 1	They probably put in too much work.
27	25 7 18 29 14 13 1 23 15 26	I went through the trouble of clicking next and waiting for it to load and all I got was this photo.
27	26 32 19 5 21 12 9 17 35 33	No energy to place this today. Gonna take a nap.
27	3 13 15 33 34 1 25 26 19 8	THanks fr carrying it for me
27	10 18 22 23 4 21 12 14 19 26	He looks so happy and laughing, I haven't laughed in awhile because it's too much work.
27	12 34 29 9 18 17 11 2 4 26	I hate walking so I like taking the bus most days.
27	28 10 12 5 14 18 31 22 3 9	I could relax for hours here.
27	11 4 13 19 28 18 20 10 1 21	This place looks like it has way too much walking around involved.
27	30 18 34 35 1 6 17 31 9 21	That's a nice looking field and trees.
27	2 33 1 14 18 5 20 13 16 30	THIS ROCKER IS ANYTHING BUT ENERGETIC
27	12 25 17 13 8 15 23 16 4 26	You wouldn't be lazy while relaxing here.
27	10 19 16 15 2 34 35 32 17 4	Where's my hammock? All I wanna do is lay around by the Highlands.
27	30 29 6 35 5 20 13 3 7 11	Good enough view from back here, why bother going to the front
27	25 15 35 5 17 14 4 28 22 11	Makes me want to veg on out on my hammock.
27	35 2 20 15 19 17 18 33 30 16	This seems like way too much work and activity, I'm getting tired just looking at this.
27	28 14 11 7 1 26 21 32 31 16	That moss is not exciting.
27	7 14 15 33 2 24 18 35 17 28	I was tired after 5 minutes, so I took a break in the grass
27	12 8 29 19 9 33 25 20 31 13	The legs looks very relaxed.
27	32 25 22 21 15 29 1 26 30 19	I didn't want to walk the town
27	32 1 12 4 3 10 33 2 34 35	No I don't want to see your pictures.  I'll just sit over here until you're done.
27	4 1 23 35 10 6 8 17 20 14	Okay, that already looks like too much work.
27	8 19 34 5 12 13 22 24 3 6	I'm just going to sit down right here.
27	28 17 4 9 21 16 18 34 7 25	Smooth wave makes me happy
27	6 9 21 35 25 32 7 12 24 17	that looks like a lot of work
27	15 25 6 12 35 22 33 5 11 7	I don't have the time to make sure my pictures of people walking down the street are lined up or even in focus.
27	8 17 12 22 9 18 15 11 4 26	Back to my couch for me.   Running?   Nope
27	30 32 33 12 16 31 24 4 8 17	I won't even bother to read these headlines, more nonsense propaganda.
27	31 18 12 3 29 25 20 8 16 7	The eyes look lazy and sleepy
27	3 13 18 25 24 11 32 34 22 7	There is too much work put into her makeup, I would never put that much effort in.
27	29 24 8 12 23 17 7 14 5 3	I should move that but I don't want to move
27	6 22 10 20 3 11 9 29 7 15	I couldn't be bothered to figure out who this lady is.
27	15 18 19 1 3 33 16 17 6 28	I can't catch the fish
27	14 24 12 9 7 15 2 23 5 26	Looks like a long way to have to walk to.
27	13 17 33 34 16 26 19 32 5 14	I sure am glad I don't have to spend all day looking for food, I would definitely starve.
27	20 34 3 35 23 33 17 26 16 9	The driver is racing on a track.
27	15 12 4 18 8 32 28 26 1 20	Looks like someone else doesn't like to finish jobs either.
27	20 8 21 28 3 32 23 6 15 18	i wish my bedroom was this neat but i am too tired to clean it
27	8 32 26 9 14 5 3 23 35 34	You would think she would clear table considering that all she would have do for the entire day.
27	10 3 29 20 30 12 31 17 24 5	This is too much walking.
27	24 17 31 35 26 32 21 23 4 16	There were supposed to be more props, but I didn't feel like carrying them from the van into the convention center.
27	19 29 24 10 13 32 18 8 1 17	I feel this guy has marshmallows in his mouth. I'm too tired to even look closer.
27	24 2 1 11 16 28 32 8 13 30	The protestors are not hard working
27	7 25 14 16 20 35 24 13 1 11	beautiful scenery with great landscaping
27	1 21 15 29 7 30 17 22 11 13	I am going to fall asleep
27	29 11 7 4 19 14 32 26 13 21	That dress doesn't look to great.
27	6 12 23 31 13 7 1 5 28 21	The weather is so cold that the only posture i could take was what you are seeing
27	25 26 10 2 12 34 28 1 18 17	The leaves in this picture have a lot of nice colors.
27	3 7 15 25 21 16 11 5 26 2	I should pick up a copy of this magazine next time.
27	11 20 26 19 24 12 18 2 4 33	Those people are riding a bike.
27	33 28 1 10 14 15 30 16 34 12	Are you guys on bikes or are you walking around?
27	9 33 26 16 12 17 10 20 18 30	I wish they would have zoomed in so I didn't have to try so hard to see.
27	14 32 1 23 11 28 12 21 9 3	yeah, it was those guys... again.
27	10 7 25 5 33 31 13 35 11 6	This just makes me want to lay down and nap
27	3 18 25 9 29 13 11 32 31 12	This is my kind of picture. Its the same picture repeated four times.
27	24 10 9 21 2 33 28 8 6 15	Someone needs to finish this construction for me.
27	30 21 1 34 26 32 17 16 6 13	Accurate photo of what I bring to the picnic.
27	32 34 25 20 35 9 14 4 10 22	The baby couldn't even bother to smile
27	28 2 22 7 18 10 6 33 1 11	Smell the flowers?  I'm too tired to get out of this chair.
27	2 6 30 9 4 10 24 23 32 7	Just looking at this makes me tired.
27	12 2 23 1 22 35 11 26 33 18	the background is mising an few heiroglyphs
27	32 20 10 22 16 7 6 11 24 1	Waiting in line... sounds like to much work
27	14 32 7 11 33 29 5 22 4 6	i dont like to walk and hunt
27	17 4 23 25 9 10 31 5 16 29	Why aren't these people at work?
27	30 13 16 23 6 35 18 19 33 31	The people don't care what everyone thinks.
27	6 2 18 22 11 25 28 34 26 8	I could never make that, way too complicated. But I would eat it.
27	18 13 25 11 33 2 4 24 7 15	I can be laid back for several days.
27	16 32 28 29 25 6 2 33 1 9	I have a cat but I don't like cleaning it's litter
27	30 23 19 31 29 34 22 3 13 10	Those animals are nothing special.
27	23 11 21 9 7 24 5 35 13 30	POOR LITTLE RASCAL LOOKS WORN OUT.
27	31 3 26 30 13 1 14 9 18 4	I can't believe he never came by to tie the boat to the dock.
27	11 18 31 34 6 19 24 29 10 2	This photo looks edited, but I couldn't.
27	35 19 11 32 28 26 21 31 16 33	And I thought I was lazy.
27	11 12 30 34 25 16 5 4 31 24	I want to sleep under the trees all day.
27	17 11 28 35 23 24 12 18 33 22	Why do we have to walk all this much?
27	20 14 16 35 34 19 3 5 30 15	Pink is too bright a color for me, but I couldn't be bothered to find another.
27	26 16 20 21 34 28 6 8 4 2	I want to visit an arboretum like this but it's too far to drive.
27	6 26 20 29 14 30 13 32 24 18	I would love to go out to see this view, but I just can't get out of bed right now.
27	7 30 24 3 31 26 17 1 21 25	Just looking at this makes me tired.
27	6 16 34 25 35 23 15 13 17 21	I'm not doing that again.
27	31 13 6 5 10 4 17 15 7 14	If only I could work up the motivation to get out of my house and attend one of these things.
27	31 10 21 14 32 29 33 1 4 6	that is a dumb idea
27	5 2 20 8 28 24 32 6 15 26	I couldn't walk up that.  Too much effort.
27	10 33 25 35 1 26 20 28 9 12	Just take the papers off
27	20 1 11 28 19 32 3 9 23 5	That hallway is way too long...I’m not sure if I can make it all the way to the door!
27	8 34 35 14 23 30 25 7 32 29	I definetley would never help clean up those balloons. That's way to much work.
27	2 32 29 33 5 12 14 18 24 19	You cannot be lazy and own one of these.
27	9 10 20 7 30 23 12 16 14 8	Wish I could laze around on the steps all day...
27	3 29 25 31 34 6 24 20 23 5	This is a profile of a woman.
27	28 4 21 11 29 7 12 3 35 16	I never had the initiative to be a drummer.
27	9 10 7 8 6 29 1 30 17 23	a pond and a tree and some clouds
27	4 24 6 10 25 1 7 20 17 33	All those wings moving just makes me tired.
27	35 15 20 28 26 7 8 13 24 31	I couldn't imagine putting your body under so much stress for this sport.
27	9 14 35 30 11 21 12 8 16 29	I wouldn't want to spend the time make this wall look better with painting either.
27	18 8 21 24 31 5 1 13 28 19	The flags fluttered softly in the breeze.
27	13 17 3 7 4 11 14 16 29 1	Oh to just sit on the back of that instead of walking.
27	15 3 7 12 14 30 6 18 17 23	Ugh, there's got to be an easier way to get back to the tour bus!
27	7 23 25 3 32 9 34 30 29 28	It's a flower. Should probably water it.
27	16 23 7 20 3 18 24 4 22 13	The nature of the hill is calm.
27	14 2 12 20 32 15 23 26 5 18	I would love to lay around with this animal.
27	35 33 12 30 25 1 29 24 17 16	I'll just leave my leftover food here, they will take care of it.
27	30 20 4 23 9 33 1 10 26 15	I can make something like this in my dreams
27	25 15 21 31 20 3 11 22 26 5	I was too lazy to crop out the guy behind me in my selfie.
27	13 20 16 19 10 35 33 12 8 21	I guess someone maybe should mow that grass.
27	4 14 25 28 23 24 30 32 20 3	These macaroons look good, but I don't feel like putting in the effort to get some.
27	33 22 19 18 16 11 26 6 15 24	Man someone should trim that tree.
27	22 3 20 13 29 31 33 1 11 10	What are they looking at?
27	5 11 20 25 32 14 2 22 12 19	nice idea to make a card
27	26 30 5 8 9 1 2 29 14 11	who will ge me a glass of fresh juice to go with this beautiful meal?
27	28 11 35 12 24 8 31 21 23 5	I cant pick the flower
27	8 4 22 10 17 14 18 35 34 28	I mean it's an ok outfit, nothing great.
27	19 32 21 22 23 8 24 30 17 11	I wouldn't want to walk in a parade
27	20 1 31 16 11 30 33 7 29 24	I would love to be on that boat kicked back with a cold one.
27	26 6 25 30 9 35 5 8 4 14	Yawn,  I fall asleep while listening to speeches like this.
27	9 19 28 23 33 7 2 26 32 4	I am glad I didn't have to build this
27	1 11 3 21 19 22 31 32 13 16	I def wouldn't want to play basketball outside on a hot day like that.
27	12 8 18 28 16 26 7 20 24 32	On a night like tonight, just relax.
27	28 7 12 17 34 11 26 31 4 21	Wish I was motivated enough to do that lol.
27	3 17 28 31 23 7 8 13 24 2	I am the guy on the couch
27	11 18 3 34 26 9 16 21 23 32	Wish I could just lay down on that.
27	34 18 5 12 15 16 1 13 7 20	You all that a fight
27	35 6 22 19 31 33 18 14 29 5	Meh...not sure why they look so happy.
27	34 13 5 9 23 1 14 21 30 4	fantasy place with full of water
27	16 6 35 7 20 18 25 2 3 23	Caring for kids is way too much work, especially on a bus.
27	1 29 22 31 11 15 26 32 5 8	Huh. Can looks nice but it's too much work to move the bottle and turn the can around so I can see the brand better.
27	9 16 11 14 3 17 30 29 5 10	He looks like he is getting punched in slow motion.
27	2 6 26 31 9 18 7 14 22 25	I'm much happier watching the swimmers work out than I am joining in.
27	5 19 12 28 34 3 7 10 32 31	I could never walk up all those steps.
27	24 32 31 25 3 22 20 9 17 28	The view is very relaxing.
27	17 26 18 9 22 8 23 14 7 12	Is this in China or Utah?
27	21 15 13 14 33 7 16 32 24 22	See I would have fomo but I'm already in but I'm already in bed
27	33 34 35 5 19 31 16 12 4 21	This picture makes me want to yawn.
27	8 23 7 4 17 29 32 21 1 24	Nice picture of some stick thing on a wall.
27	10 7 17 20 6 5 25 19 30 11	I wish they had pre-washed and peeled fruits to make it more convenient to eat healthy on the go.
27	10 25 33 31 4 6 35 18 17 16	Seems like too much work for me
27	7 5 3 21 33 18 19 22 1 15	Sundown is the best time.
27	21 16 15 33 26 5 3 25 17 23	I'd be taking a nap under that tree.  Looks like a good day to do nothing.
27	5 16 33 15 11 21 6 13 34 2	I would like to attend this parade if I could sit.  It doesn't look like any chairs are available.  My legs would be killing me after five minutes of this.
27	8 4 9 6 31 13 19 29 34 21	What I would give to be off work lounging on the beach right now.
27	11 21 31 22 24 3 2 28 13 26	I could play guitar too, just dont feel like it
27	6 34 1 30 8 22 11 3 4 23	trying to hard to smile for the camera
27	16 23 22 30 18 24 5 7 20 3	put that car down and just relax for the day
27	23 19 26 32 24 9 3 4 15 35	Put the fire out later, let's relax
27	33 35 12 9 13 16 10 14 19 2	I dont want to walk that far
27	7 30 20 1 16 28 26 17 8 6	Final set tear down, too much work by the looks of it.
27	22 18 33 4 13 24 3 32 1 21	I don't want to walk or swim,just sleep
27	1 24 32 30 15 34 16 26 6 12	Those people need to get it goether
27	31 8 19 1 21 24 35 11 4 3	I could climb that mountain if I felt like it, maybe tomorrow.
27	20 5 6 22 32 29 8 14 31 1	I don'tmind the downslope, but I hate the going back up
27	9 3 12 28 19 35 1 4 25 10	Um, it's a guy on a bike and there are trees, blah blah, whatever.
27	15 14 24 30 8 32 4 35 21 20	I just want to sit around all day and eat whatever that is.
27	12 25 20 13 33 21 8 28 19 7	I would rather be at home watching tv than to be watching a kids game.
27	2 34 35 26 4 7 5 3 25 21	Looks like a great place to relax.
27	17 18 21 32 16 13 6 24 14 12	flower looks like it's dying
27	7 26 12 9 22 3 23 19 1 16	That looks like a nice night out
27	25 33 21 5 1 6 30 23 18 22	I wouldnt be able to build something like that
27	7 26 11 32 19 23 30 21 5 20	How'd you even gegt this view?
27	12 14 22 6 7 5 13 1 29 25	We wind up at the Indian restaurant again. Will some one please drive us anywhere else.
27	19 6 18 4 8 11 5 17 2 26	I want a nice garden with flowers like this, but it's just too much work.
27	19 30 21 6 15 26 18 12 13 8	I love it when you can park your car right in front of the building, and don't have to travel far to park. If only it were like this everywhere.
27	28 25 32 14 12 22 34 30 16 8	I can't be bothered to learn what kind of plant this is.
27	20 21 32 24 14 34 23 4 28 30	Baa baa sheep, baa baa.
27	20 19 30 28 14 17 5 12 26 35	Oh, a statue, so what?
27	31 28 8 13 10 30 12 25 24 6	I'd like to lay out by this fire.
27	26 17 22 3 12 15 18 29 34 14	My boat ride was so good I just was so lazy and shift less.
27	33 25 31 11 5 24 10 19 2 22	I do not feel like getting up,you chase the child
27	25 28 12 30 7 33 19 8 34 9	You two keep on painting while I watch
27	11 13 21 17 5 1 15 19 18 16	I want to fly, but I sleep too much for the schooling lol.
27	2 4 30 8 34 17 14 29 20 5	Kids are too much work, I would rather sleep
27	11 3 28 16 31 5 21 25 18 23	What a lowly flower. I bet it sleeps all day.
27	33 18 20 7 28 2 10 1 35 32	Such a beautiful neighborhood, but I don't want to walk around that much to see it.
27	7 12 13 18 17 32 10 14 3 5	Are you ready for a family holiday feast?
27	25 10 2 17 11 32 22 26 8 4	Laying down on the grass when a fury friend tries for my attention. Go away, I'm tired.
27	8 17 16 3 11 9 10 20 29 31	looks like i have to quit work because im not getting back up after this break
27	35 25 28 13 2 7 33 18 20 29	Just hanging around by the fountain all day.
27	5 28 14 6 32 12 10 22 21 29	I would try to read this sign but its too hard.
27	16 2 23 7 1 15 6 24 30 26	I don't want to move
27	8 3 22 25 26 6 34 32 24 14	Looks like anokayplacetotake a nap
27	35 19 10 17 8 16 31 9 21 34	I hope I won't have to clean up after any of them.
27	14 31 5 26 24 25 11 8 3 35	I wanted cookies, instead I got doilies. I guess thats no reason to get up.
27	30 31 12 18 7 26 8 5 32 6	Yup, that's a NOPE. I'll come back another time and climb the steps. For now - NAP on the grass!
27	15 32 3 2 6 13 5 7 20 22	Finish your meal, there are starving children in Asia who would fight for just a crumb.
27	8 34 15 18 19 26 13 32 35 12	Is that how they're making the bread? That looks easy. I hate how long it takes me to make food.
27	10 9 29 33 18 1 19 31 17 26	This looks like an exhausting hike.
27	21 24 6 23 10 1 15 4 35 17	These bowlers don't look like they bowl much.
27	10 26 18 6 1 4 16 32 3 5	This needs to be cleaned out.
27	25 11 31 3 8 6 24 18 34 15	The dog can have the chair. I'm so tired I can't even expend the energy it would take to move it.
27	18 23 16 29 4 31 10 24 19 12	Jus' who are these dudes, motivations speakers or somethin'?  Jeez, just I DON'T need to hear!
27	5 15 35 1 29 25 6 33 18 8	I think I will just take a nap next to the flowers.
27	12 5 20 21 10 15 4 29 23 34	So much water and so many waves.
27	29 30 3 20 7 23 22 6 24 25	I'm not even going to try to solve this puzzle, I'll sit here and wait for you.
27	28 7 8 33 11 15 16 35 29 6	Kids never want to go outside anymore, just play on phones
27	22 29 33 9 31 11 1 34 24 10	I would go on a hike like that if I did not prefer to laze around the house to do nothing.
27	1 19 28 20 13 18 3 7 6 29	It looks like there are too many stairs. I wonder if there is an elevator.
27	7 35 4 19 8 25 22 20 10 29	The way this is tied will be fine, no need to do more.
27	2 20 34 16 23 10 29 12 17 15	I'd be sitting in that chair.
27	8 33 20 1 16 23 25 10 26 22	You could make these faster if you had some kind of mold.
27	13 20 23 4 32 29 10 33 30 19	I could lay down beneath this and just stare, and do nothing else... well probably forever because I don't move much lol.
27	33 21 10 13 15 28 34 14 25 35	This photo is too complicated for me to interpret.
27	3 33 32 28 21 4 19 29 26 5	I'd like to take a nap right in the shadow of that boulder.
27	15 4 20 25 29 22 17 35 23 1	He doesn't even look like he's singing
27	29 35 30 22 17 4 20 15 18 25	I would love to be a lizard and waste days doing nothing.
27	22 14 35 8 16 19 13 28 18 25	Nice view, though I could never see myself climbing a hill that huge.
27	10 34 11 6 29 8 28 17 15 13	This hallway seems too long, I'd rather look at it from here.
27	16 30 14 28 17 3 19 21 5 10	man, rowing down that river would be back breaking work.
27	26 10 25 14 4 29 1 17 20 11	The life jacket alone would've been fine.  No need for the hat.
27	26 4 13 7 12 17 19 20 16 1	What an old, broken down church.
27	29 17 26 11 34 19 10 4 6 28	Such a gloomy night. I am too tired to walk.
27	17 2 14 15 5 22 6 20 29 28	The people who built this are gone. Shows what good effort is. Where is my chair.
27	30 12 13 2 1 6 31 11 29 10	It looks too busy under the big top tent . I think Ill just lay out here on the grass and take a cat nap.
27	29 24 1 20 28 34 31 26 25 23	Don't bother reading about them because we all know what they are.
27	5 12 33 28 15 22 24 11 1 17	Is this number of a door
27	3 35 20 11 2 4 21 26 10 24	What a nice bench, perfect place to sit and rest a while.
27	18 20 11 33 26 8 6 7 16 4	Mmmmm... I'd love to crawl into that bed and take a nap!
27	26 8 19 20 24 31 6 2 34 3	What's an owl doing out during the day
27	7 14 8 21 33 18 10 9 19 31	looks like a long ride
27	32 2 25 34 19 16 23 9 11 20	I don't want to swim closer to the boat. Too far.
27	33 4 32 23 31 18 5 13 7 3	Dark skies always make me feel like napping.
27	30 18 5 15 32 21 1 9 24 26	During vacation, the only thing I can manage to accomplish is taking a few blurry pictures
27	18 24 12 25 35 8 20 16 26 4	I don't think I would walk that high up.
27	26 10 13 12 18 28 16 6 29 8	The mom should use paper cups for his juice, so she doesn't have to wash anything.
27	33 32 20 29 5 21 25 8 2 22	I don't have the energy for that kind of commitment
27	7 1 33 10 34 31 17 6 30 5	Everyone is lazy, their dancing is too slow.
27	20 5 21 1 25 32 12 8 10 31	This text is sloppy and boring.
27	6 29 20 32 4 33 10 13 35 19	I need to hold a bunch of balloons today to hold me upright lol.  I am that tired.
27	7 5 22 34 14 18 30 11 24 21	this crowd makes me tired
27	12 19 16 6 22 20 30 17 8 18	I would hate to have to be making all those baskets.
27	22 3 23 31 35 10 26 28 29 13	pink flower on a green fielkd
27	31 11 19 22 14 12 25 28 30 13	I have so many apples growing on my tree outside, but I just don't feel like getting up to go and get them.
27	30 24 22 8 15 23 9 3 34 14	I would never be able in that position because I'm too lethargic to exercise
27	12 30 25 13 6 31 9 18 20 34	Yeah, we could scrub it down first; or we could just paint directly over it.
27	6 11 34 9 35 17 12 30 20 22	I don't want to walk here, it's too far.
27	21 11 1 14 30 16 31 33 29 34	eh, it's just a flower. Nothing special here.
27	32 7 28 9 8 1 2 24 35 31	It would take way too long to learn to fly this thing.
27	22 11 29 26 10 2 6 17 9 19	It's not even worth standing up to look at this rock.
27	23 3 24 16 6 2 25 32 26 17	A road by a bunch of trees and weeds.
27	4 12 31 35 16 28 13 5 18 14	Wow, I wish I was sitting down like these two boys! And I wish someone could push me in a stroller too!
27	28 13 34 25 32 33 12 14 1 24	I wonder how long this took to make.
27	1 12 9 4 21 31 30 34 35 19	I'd love to get out more and take pictures like this, but I just can't get out of bed.
27	32 8 12 35 9 11 7 20 26 29	There should really be parking spots by the entrance.
27	35 25 24 16 31 13 20 18 6 12	looks like a fun group to chill with
27	3 31 24 29 22 23 28 1 14 20	Just a picture of a painting.
27	24 32 7 4 1 34 8 15 22 26	Lol, I never bothered making my yard look pretty when I lived in a place like this either.
27	13 25 12 5 18 32 3 35 14 26	Making a stonehenge prototype, or just lazing around cracking rocks??
27	28 21 31 8 1 17 2 10 12 29	No roaming about please; let's get some work done.
27	14 10 16 11 34 8 1 17 4 30	I don't know why they want all of those kids to run. Poor kids, looks hot.

27	1 22 35 30 9 11 28 23 8 7	I too love to just sit back the same way and whle away a good afternoon with some good old wine.
27	14 6 31 28 21 18 5 4 24 16	Blue makes me want to nap.
27	35 28 18 1 4 32 29 23 13 10	doing work makes me sleepy
27	19 18 6 29 28 20 2 32 33 3	I could trim these bushes but I am too tired.
27	15 22 11 34 16 19 21 4 3 29	What do these pipes do?
27	30 12 22 8 10 15 26 33 18 31	I would never take the time to set up an event like this
27	6 35 23 21 8 20 3 34 17 11	The lights at this club  must have taken hours to set up thats too much work
27	1 19 22 28 6 13 35 30 29 9	This is just what my front yard looks like.  I never want to cut the weeds.
27	29 13 9 28 14 4 2 30 6 22	I want to lay at home on the couch all day just like him.
27	21 34 9 12 32 14 29 17 28 22	That chair looks comfortable, I need a seat.
27	4 3 11 1 12 17 18 2 5 30	she is not feeling energetic
27	17 20 25 13 1 23 5 14 19 33	I think I'll be sleep in that class.

27	17 13 29 32 21 20 16 30 14 35	Why are they even bothering
27	1 4 11 12 22 6 35 21 14 8	I wonder why people would run all over the countryside just to see some old ruins, I couldn't be bothered.
27	33 20 13 17 28 24 18 5 3 1	Wish I could just spend every day floating down a river like this. So tired of working.
27	25 29 10 18 2 11 1 31 15 23	Someone should clean this cage.
27	18 32 33 14 24 5 1 25 9 26	I really don't care what this picture is about
27	20 23 31 3 21 9 24 1 12 35	I'd dance but I'm too tired
27	7 32 33 11 14 1 26 5 34 18	Yeah, that's more than I'd do
27	18 33 12 9 1 32 22 20 16 29	Sitting on the ground while writing sounds really good.
27	17 25 14 12 18 11 28 33 16 1	This guys wife didn't want to help him work out anymore so he just started using her.
27	10 22 9 14 7 8 25 29 12 4	I don't understand what this picture is trying to say, and I don't care to learn either, too much work!
27	6 28 10 29 3 13 17 7 34 24	looks like too much work!

27	5 3 17 25 20 9 12 35 16 23	Looking at this just makes me sleepy.
27	30 18 12 17 10 22 34 21 13 4	I know the battery is flat but I don't see why I need to recharge it.
27	35 6 14 17 9 33 3 1 23 21	It's looks broken, I would just buy another one.
27	12 30 5 15 6 34 1 32 14 17	It looks like a beautiful day to go outside, but I don't feel like leaving my house.
27	7 6 19 15 23 29 26 12 22 2	I'd hate to have to round up those carts every day
27	25 28 11 19 17 18 30 35 24 5	Taxi stand? What if I want to sit lol
27	6 35 22 24 23 25 14 12 18 15	Getting to the bottom looks like way too much work.
27	19 30 32 23 35 29 12 26 1 22	Why didn't you just run to the base?
27	4 30 21 6 24 26 28 10 12 7	It's called a speed limit.  Nothing says I have to go that fast.
27	5 11 34 33 14 3 4 24 30 12	Walking is actual exercise. ew.
27	8 5 19 34 6 14 13 28 18 24	I'd like to be lounging around just like that about now.
27	17 9 15 11 10 18 1 16 19 31	I'd really prefer to be inside, sleeping.
27	26 14 29 2 22 24 19 35 6 1	The horse wants to be at rest all day.
27	19 33 30 14 13 9 7 5 29 16	That hill must have been exhausting to climb up.
27	32 18 19 30 1 15 29 21 35 12	I wish Hanna came out tonight she's so lazy to stay home.
27	16 8 15 32 4 19 29 35 12 1	I would like to sit in the back too, instead of driving. I like to enjoy my car rides.
27	30 14 8 32 1 4 3 26 11 28	The lazy coach sits on the side lines just to get his pay check.
27	6 22 28 16 7 14 32 18 26 8	I could lay around on that boat all day long
27	3 34 22 25 2 10 23 1 17 14	After doing nothing with his life for over 10 years; he finally found a passion.
27	9 5 4 6 29 31 22 34 19 15	it looks like I didn't care enough to properly put the toilet paper away.
27	33 16 17 34 23 2 32 13 31 8	So I forgot to water them.
27	8 31 7 24 29 9 22 13 11 3	What an inactive dome! I bet the architect was lousy to think about something better!

27	23 17 4 21 31 30 26 6 12 11	That looks like a great spot to find a spot to sunbathe and take a nap.
27	1 29 15 7 30 4 26 5 24 14	I would never want to expel the energy to play this game.
27	8 12 11 32 10 30 4 15 1 16	wow look at the flower
27	29 13 35 19 10 16 5 33 25 18	too much effort put in to getting ready
27	28 32 6 2 21 18 4 25 5 33	I think i'd love to go swim in this water but it's too far away.
27	22 17 34 33 23 35 2 5 29 10	Why are they wasting so much time on the computer...
27	21 19 2 8 16 15 9 25 5 13	Babies take way too work.
27	34 19 18 12 25 24 33 8 14 5	I don't think I'd have the energy to go to a city like that.
27	31 19 4 22 35 25 9 34 24 7	I can't go to the concert, I'm too tired
27	32 28 17 18 23 34 15 29 20 8	Looks like a great place to kick back and relax on a holiday weekend.
27	29 10 1 4 24 35 28 21 22 32	I wouldn't go on this ride. I wouldn't want to make the walk.
27	15 2 25 3 35 22 11 12 34 5	It looks so hot. It makes me want to pull up a chair, pour some lemonade, and let the desert heat tan my skin.
27	19 10 23 4 1 29 14 25 26 34	guess grandpa had fun sorry I couldn't come
27	4 34 17 12 14 20 3 19 24 25	This dog makes me want to go to sleep
27	15 30 23 9 12 3 6 34 24 32	A tree with leaves and flowers.
27	23 16 32 22 20 14 9 24 3 34	I could never get out and exercise in that weather.
27	4 7 32 29 19 16 28 26 18 31	Too much work to hang these curtains
27	10 7 33 23 5 4 6 14 19 22	This looks like a good wall to lean against
27	30 8 6 29 19 17 5 28 33 13	I don't feel like driving to wok today. Can I go home?
27	24 19 4 28 13 16 7 5 17 2	I did not look at the mirror before wearing this top
27	25 18 35 4 9 32 26 28 34 12	I guess I should say something
27	32 26 8 1 6 35 31 22 28 20	There's a lot of bubbles there.
27	33 8 31 16 9 21 2 34 35 6	I would have just set the plant out and not bothered with the sign or box.
27	22 15 9 1 28 23 33 16 35 32	Iʻm told this was Jai Alai
27	2 18 5 9 29 16 7 20 25 32	Iʻd get an electric bike
27	7 16 6 21 25 9 15 12 33 29	I don't want to look at this pic today
27	11 6 13 19 32 30 10 14 15 25	I looked up to take this picture
27	21 19 12 30 5 31 18 16 9 20	Anyone want to hang my card for me so I can take a nap
27	23 35 15 2 10 31 24 26 28 21	Eh, someone's got too much time on their hands looking after those trees
27	29 7 32 18 2 26 31 21 8 33	I'm happy it's not me playing the accordion!  That's a tough instrument to learn.
27	22 20 10 7 14 2 23 25 3 15	The laid back vibe sets off his groove.
27	19 17 11 26 33 10 15 5 7 9	to tired to hike today
27	19 21 25 29 23 8 26 9 1 20	That room up there looks like a perfect place to sit and admire the view. I couldn't possibly walk around this whole place. It looks like it goes on forever.
27	30 26 10 25 28 13 29 17 33 32	That oufit looks like too much work to put together.
27	13 6 24 29 26 28 32 3 8 23	They just left work and are going to eat.
27	22 23 17 26 9 6 33 15 5 30	I wouldn't want to dress up for this event.
27	22 16 24 33 31 6 5 2 11 21	I want to go see the tigers at the zoo but I don't wanna look for my shoes
27	32 5 9 13 22 20 25 33 12 35	good to see kids playing
27	23 9 11 5 1 35 13 15 2 31	I would try to read what's on his screen but I don't feel like it.
27	32 7 12 22 30 33 21 6 35 16	Can someone else clean this?
27	23 30 28 17 18 7 13 35 10 32	I hope I get to sleep as much as those chickens.
27	31 9 15 13 10 14 16 2 6 20	I'd do takeout every meal if I had the cash.
27	4 25 21 19 2 31 10 34 16 1	That looks like a lot of work
27	32 19 20 12 31 4 30 34 15 6	He should take a break.
27	3 31 24 20 15 7 19 9 35 22	The time of day, color of the sunset gives off a sluggish feel.
27	10 22 20 4 35 31 30 19 16 3	A very easy craft to do.
27	17 21 6 29 2 26 1 35 22 32	You couldn't be a slouch flying a helicopter.
27	23 30 17 4 35 3 26 25 24 32	So cloudy over the water
27	28 11 29 4 7 6 30 15 25 21	The man in the photo is taking a photo, which takes too much energy for me to do.
28	15 4 2 6 25 7 13 34 5 18	What an intriguing city that must be.
28	1 27 15 31 7 29 9 8 23 19	This looks like what can make an human disappear
28	9 1 30 10 33 29 18 23 6 7	How darling! I wish I could float into the story line, and join the adventure.
28	27 26 32 10 31 21 33 22 13 30	What an incredible sunlight, shown through the tall trees.
28	31 8 14 33 32 27 3 12 17 16	These flowers are beautiful, if I were a bee I would be flying towards them too.
28	8 12 7 10 31 32 35 9 27 16	I would have to be born in a different time to play baseball.
28	20 24 9 29 32 2 34 18 5 8	The minds gathered here are ready to take on the world..
28	7 3 17 35 23 5 11 24 15 2	What an interesting room, I wonder what is in those bags.

28	3 8 34 6 33 5 17 23 24 18	Wow it looks hard trying to kick a basketball.

28	1 5 34 13 22 11 12 3 21 6	How did this get here?  Was it blown from the wind? who knows.
28	35 32 23 25 21 12 19 30 2 18	The scooter seems to disappear into the night with the lightbeam shining on a portion of what appears to be a car -or is it?!
28	20 1 30 4 15 31 27 9 12 21	Where is the ice cream?
28	25 21 35 2 20 15 6 5 7 27	As the ball soared majestically, no knew where its story would end.
28	15 25 3 4 1 16 18 33 29 24	that bus looks just like the ones in the harry potter movies
28	11 23 19 33 2 17 21 5 22 8	The sea holds many secrets waiting to be discovered.

28	13 7 24 2 26 3 11 30 31 22	If I could, I would point a wand and make the skateboard fly.
28	17 11 20 24 4 35 6 10 1 15	Cloud day at the beach
28	22 29 25 23 4 24 35 9 18 34	The seagull is bringing me a message from beyond.
28	26 13 3 35 25 30 10 27 12 18	This seems like a place to be one with yourself.
28	18 31 3 19 2 21 25 14 26 27	I wonder what crazy potion that magical flask holds?
28	12 9 4 18 33 3 8 27 26 29	This leave can cure Hiv
28	35 24 8 30 32 15 20 13 12 31	I wonder if in this car some magic is in place?

28	33 25 4 14 11 24 13 7 26 10	This is an ancient building
28	10 6 33 12 14 31 4 24 32 21	It was such a colorful river

29	1 14 13 15 5 31 23 34 2 21	Why would you want to swim in that nasty water.
29	11 2 7 20 19 24 28 5 14 13	This is an ugly lobster, I prefer fish.

29	31 25 1 9 5 2 16 17 26 18	This place was boring - zero stars
29	24 25 8 31 23 26 14 32 27 15	Everyone is just lazy and sitting
29	9 6 14 23 11 25 19 35 27 17	It's like a home depot paint section
29	17 19 12 2 35 5 28 21 18 20	I don't know why we have to sit here and listen to these kids play.
29	7 6 30 20 10 32 13 34 27 28	I guess it's sort of cute when a baby's happy.

29	34 5 15 7 11 1 35 19 33 20	We won't be going anywhere for a while.
29	9 32 14 15 11 34 8 4 5 6	No shine , no colors , nothing to catch the perceptive eye.
29	26 6 1 24 5 34 19 10 3 17	This is a nice color.

29	3 15 5 28 23 35 27 22 6 14	An old cup, probably made with some form of lead, I prefer something a bit newer.
29	4 3 16 11 28 31 19 27 8 5	I don't have any opinion on this image.

29	20 5 28 33 15 19 6 23 31 17	A child wearing overalls and a plaid shirt smiling.  He has some food on his face.  It looks like he's sitting on a desk.  It might be a table, but I'm fairly certain it's a desk.

29	22 27 26 24 23 14 19 17 16 2	Where ever this place is, the people in the photo looked bored.  I wouldn't want to be there.
29	33 30 6 20 16 28 5 3 8 34	Just imagine when the little cuties sees this 15 years from now and how colors would have advanced then

29	10 28 1 31 7 15 19 13 35 32	Perhaps this person is fond of animals, but perhaps not.
29	15 9 14 5 28 13 19 16 11 8	I love the lighting on this one!
29	3 7 34 6 10 17 15 21 26 30	Most not drink again, can't move my body.

29	2 28 19 14 33 15 31 11 8 34	These boys do not look like they are having too much fun.
29	23 7 33 2 12 15 9 26 3 30	Rocks, rocks, and more rocks. Nothing much going on here.

29	23 4 7 35 32 24 10 1 5 17	I once went here, it was very nice but I went to a local cafe and the cue was so long that It took forever to get a drink, I can't remember what I ordered now but I remember it being quite nice, but I don't say it's worth the wait. Anyway it was a nice holiday, but I was excited to get home and feed my cat
29	33 9 24 2 12 14 8 5 1 32	I see this as boring, the looks on their face proves it.

29	25 11 21 3 28 8 14 18 30 17	Ugh this reminds me of my morning commute.

29	12 4 9 34 5 19 1 22 28 31	I don't understand why this man is looking at the sign.
29	25 7 5 30 13 16 15 8 17 11	This picture is pretty boring.
29	26 19 24 13 22 7 14 17 2 6	The flowers are sitting in the center of the table.
29	30 26 3 22 23 11 17 21 5 7	The picture is so smokey and blurry.
29	14 17 34 5 32 4 24 18 3 1	Yep.  A place with a building and water.
29	21 27 3 22 9 2 31 5 16 4	Where this bug hangs out, you wouldnt want to hang out because it would be so boring.
29	24 13 3 12 28 27 25 26 34 32	it was cold outside but at least the kids were happy
29	7 20 17 12 9 26 3 5 32 19	I'm bored here in this mass.
29	17 27 28 30 13 18 19 1 32 34	Hm, I'm not really a fan of flowers.
29	33 21 35 18 2 17 13 30 27 6	i love just sitting and listening
29	13 20 33 17 3 4 26 35 2 31	this kid looks like they need a bath
29	9 1 21 14 22 10 15 7 12 32	This is the most boring plant I've ever seen.
29	25 33 12 21 10 9 4 28 27 8	No life in the picture
29	1 32 8 15 14 6 11 20 17 7	A green fruit hangs off a tree stem.
29	21 25 18 17 28 26 24 9 16 14	A bunch of kids playing soccer
29	27 5 11 22 19 26 18 17 10 16	There is an Asian women within a park.
29	27 7 20 4 24 12 31 15 10 33	This color is how I feel.
29	32 7 20 19 2 8 22 14 25 11	This car is old but it's okay I guess.
29	9 4 27 7 1 11 22 12 33 26	I guess it seems like an alright place.
29	32 12 28 24 34 11 31 23 9 27	Looks like they are having a great time, I would not be though.
29	15 8 17 26 34 27 22 3 10 33	The party was so boring even the dog stared blankly.
29	14 27 17 1 10 32 25 18 30 5	Last years cheap Christmas decorations
29	35 10 28 21 32 30 2 11 15 12	Why is everyone wearing the same color shirts
29	1 15 34 32 4 27 16 22 9 10	Oh look, another new Starbucks cup
29	30 5 2 18 15 17 10 19 4 27	Those bricks could use some cleaning
29	1 7 16 12 23 27 21 28 14 8	What an utter waste of time.
29	30 21 32 1 26 19 20 3 34 22	I like those black cars...
29	16 19 33 11 23 24 14 20 34 15	This photo made me almost fall asleep.
29	27 19 34 4 10 9 5 35 26 24	THE BLADE WAS VERY DULL AND INCONSISTENT.
29	11 17 1 9 24 35 33 2 5 14	"Get me out of this dumb outfit"
29	15 13 4 14 30 5 8 24 6 11	The patterns on this plant are simplistic.
29	22 9 15 28 26 31 7 16 24 30	Some plants? What is so special now, dumb.
29	24 32 1 31 13 11 28 23 3 30	Another day in the city.
29	3 2 11 23 20 14 35 16 32 30	I will like to live here
29	32 22 14 7 5 9 15 10 30 24	Ugh just some guy sitting doing nothing.
29	25 13 20 32 24 16 31 34 2 12	An old dirt road to nothing.
29	4 13 19 3 31 34 2 1 15 26	The frame is very depressive and dark. The blue is very bland.
29	13 19 16 30 1 22 14 24 7 10	I've flown on airplanes a few times.
29	7 11 22 10 26 4 23 2 20 16	Never really been to a place like this. My new job as a tree stand is only gonna make it harder to get out.
29	13 27 24 28 33 5 8 17 19 20	This is water hitting rocks
29	32 12 22 19 1 18 30 10 17 11	the color is too flat
29	4 26 18 27 2 15 12 13 6 8	This photo is too dark.
29	21 3 10 25 15 32 20 18 7 1	It might be a nice vacation spot, nothing too crazy going on, just somewhere new.
29	30 13 3 12 33 17 14 11 8 24	That view looks so boring
29	1 35 18 11 26 21 7 3 2 27	Boring old colors, what is new here?
29	27 10 28 25 17 23 11 26 4 14	You would think that because this green is bright, I would consider it lively but I see it to be pretty dull.
29	28 23 2 30 17 16 18 4 21 1	I see some windows. I see road. There are bicycles One bicycle is ridden by someone wearing a coat.
29	21 10 5 31 16 15 13 35 22 26	It's blue I guess. Maybe the image didn't load. Oh well.
29	23 2 3 18 24 30 10 17 11 14	Why is he wearing colors?  black is better.
29	21 7 4 26 9 11 12 27 28 23	Buildings Other Many To Compared Boring Rather Is Architecture The
29	16 7 22 34 26 4 27 19 31 32	Skateparks are nothing but a place for children to hurt themselves.
29	7 9 18 15 25 4 24 31 6 17	Oh look, another grassy hill in another non-descript place.
29	10 6 17 19 24 16 1 9 5 22	Just a old railroad track.
29	19 4 3 30 26 28 35 10 1 12	Pancake syrup.  Cereal. Tweety mugs.
29	31 32 5 7 1 30 15 23 16 18	A crowd of people doing nothing.
29	8 20 5 32 22 23 17 28 10 6	Just a road next to a hill.
29	18 26 10 12 25 28 3 21 24 16	The road is net to trees
29	19 14 17 10 23 35 32 12 13 25	I can't see what is happening in this picture everything is blurry all I see is bald spots.
29	19 31 32 12 5 3 18 34 33 26	I'm blue, if I were green I would die, if I were green I would die, if I were green I would die
29	35 31 19 9 20 10 17 2 11 18	It is adorable how he is holding the child.
29	31 5 35 27 8 24 22 33 12 1	That child is confused about things.
29	26 33 24 32 8 25 13 10 28 35	The lines on the chart go up and down, up and down.
29	26 21 31 16 23 13 4 14 20 7	Looks like a sport I dont know
29	22 10 12 16 30 28 35 32 13 9	This looks like my cousins hometown.
29	33 32 25 7 28 24 12 8 13 34	I just think this photo is drab.
29	32 2 15 9 3 35 27 14 5 26	I am not very interested in those waters.
29	13 4 8 32 25 34 6 16 14 20	This is a field of mostly weeds
29	30 16 26 27 8 25 7 24 10 28	Gross color, I hate it.
29	6 32 13 1 21 15 34 17 33 35	The sushi has no flavor.
29	22 1 26 19 8 16 11 25 24 2	That's a fairly boring street scene, nothing very interesting in that.
29	7 35 5 3 26 22 18 11 9 17	that's nice. you guys look great. thanks.
29	1 2 23 27 7 12 18 31 17 14	I don't understand if this is art or not.
29	13 23 2 4 11 17 12 22 33 26	The design of these items is very basic.
29	2 3 27 13 31 6 25 28 20 26	Just riding a bike at 2 MPH
29	22 25 32 30 8 24 20 18 15 27	The desert is brown, tan and dry.
29	32 27 18 28 19 17 8 16 22 14	Nature is boring to me, nothing really happens.
29	35 31 20 32 16 9 6 15 19 1	That mountain range is normal
29	8 26 34 22 19 17 12 3 20 13	This looks like a boring place to be.
29	13 25 9 11 7 28 6 21 4 16	noone is even watching this game
29	18 28 30 13 14 21 1 24 23 11	That's a very skinny tree.
29	31 34 13 14 4 8 1 16 21 5	Oh, look at that white shirt how boring.
29	28 34 23 33 11 25 13 26 21 20	Yea, i dont like muscle guys flexing on my beach.
29	28 31 35 19 8 13 9 20 5 11	What a gloomy, depressing kind of day outside...
29	23 35 19 17 25 4 11 6 16 12	This is a female without 20/20 vision.
29	8 30 25 12 33 5 26 19 18 32	That iphone is really old and obsolete.
29	21 16 32 8 31 4 24 20 5 22	Yawn.  Boring.  Why do people like wasting their time?
29	19 30 12 27 6 3 25 13 4 24	Another boring day, another boring blue sky.
29	27 35 34 32 1 22 18 7 9 26	Nothing here to look at.
29	26 17 35 20 18 25 22 6 13 7	Most excitement I seen all week.  Yawn.

29	4 16 22 31 25 26 5 6 3 27	Hopefully this will be a nice and boring experience.
29	32 28 22 10 1 14 25 19 9 15	I want to go eat a hot dog and then take a nap.
29	33 21 7 15 14 13 8 19 32 25	The shape of this land was created by water over many thousands of years...
29	16 26 25 14 32 6 5 22 33 2	I GUESS ITS A BORING BOARD MEETING
29	27 6 35 8 22 2 14 31 32 11	Squatting weights, that is boring, why bother?
29	7 31 19 26 17 12 25 13 33 9	This black and white picture is okay.
29	7 31 17 26 33 14 32 8 1 35	why wouldn't you just walk
29	11 13 18 35 2 5 6 14 25 27	He is talking about how sleepy he is
29	26 28 21 16 19 2 14 4 12 18	I like the white color.

29	21 3 26 31 13 17 5 10 12 28	This book is smells like paper.
29	8 21 5 11 24 33 2 34 14 10	This must be a July 4th celebration.
29	33 34 22 4 23 35 30 16 18 10	Why would she ever wear those glasses in public ?
29	2 6 14 20 1 7 17 8 27 9	Just another plain wedding, nothing to see here.
29	35 10 34 14 8 26 17 25 20 27	The quiet, the serenity, how boring.
29	9 7 20 13 27 10 1 32 33 2	That outfit looks worn out.
29	13 34 5 22 10 35 16 4 3 14	Blue is my favorite color
29	15 20 31 25 12 24 10 14 2 21	What an odd outfit for a dog.
29	2 14 13 24 31 35 10 33 25 26	How incredibly boring. Sewing all day would make me sleepy.
29	11 9 23 8 26 34 19 16 15 28	They are probably going down or up
29	34 21 32 6 28 19 1 4 27 23	i hate when people speed
29	35 5 16 2 6 28 25 4 31 20	The big problem with bodies of water is you're so far away from everything. Just look here, nothing is happening.
29	35 16 18 30 12 28 7 24 8 20	This is not food, maybe chinesse
29	32 34 33 1 21 15 18 14 26 13	Looks like they're saving the day.
29	26 32 33 1 13 7 9 14 4 12	Oh, that's a nice tree in the background.
29	12 14 32 30 24 4 7 18 16 25	Looks like a barn... nothing special.
29	17 21 9 30 3 15 27 24 5 8	I see two sides of a sidewalk and some lights.
29	19 26 30 5 33 27 15 4 9 10	Don't get your pretty pink jacket dirty.
29	25 10 9 5 6 28 4 34 15 21	Bikes get you where you want to go.
29	22 27 20 32 4 31 26 18 5 15	This is a horrible color.

29	5 33 13 14 16 32 20 15 18 23	This looks like it would be okay, maybe a bit nerve-wracking.
29	30 18 22 34 10 13 33 11 5 8	Not much to say about her. She has nice hair and its black.
29	4 3 18 12 25 7 23 30 27 13	What a big rock, I could just sit there today.

29	22 5 8 19 4 16 15 12 32 31	Is this just a picture of a stream, like with no people?
29	8 20 23 33 17 27 28 3 14 9	These look worn and ragged.
29	30 9 25 11 22 14 19 33 24 20	The picture is of ferns, lot of ferns.
29	30 6 14 15 27 21 26 4 22 7	This here is an airport terminal, it looks like there's been some flooding.

29	17 15 32 3 22 26 7 13 30 35	I can't believe there are that many people who want to play boring pool.
29	12 13 11 20 1 35 2 34 10 3	Just another town hall meeting
29	5 9 4 13 17 27 28 21 23 1	Nature puts me to sleep.

29	27 15 11 18 21 2 30 12 8 26	I would sleep on the floor there, the room needs a friend.
29	34 6 3 1 35 12 16 25 5 15	Another building and a tree, nothing new here.
29	18 17 35 1 11 7 23 34 6 15	Boring old city... so drab
29	5 12 31 22 25 11 33 21 19 10	The highlight of my day is staring out of the windows that are covered by blinds.  The neutral colors make me feel nice.
29	23 33 2 3 28 13 27 22 12 15	The lack of lighting makes this picture not interesting.
29	5 16 2 35 11 13 15 10 14 28	Rankings of any sort tend to put me to sleep.
29	19 5 26 20 23 16 11 14 7 22	Climbing is a waste of time.

29	17 4 14 25 3 31 8 32 23 16	The room looks like it is home to many fitness classes.
29	16 20 6 22 33 3 27 26 1 31	It is snowing, obviously. I wonder if it is cold?
29	7 22 3 5 4 15 30 16 26 25	They don't seem like a very special family.
29	17 6 26 35 25 11 5 28 20 32	Weddings seem like they might be a good time

29	27 31 20 6 10 21 16 22 33 3	I wish the duck on the left was more colorful.
29	6 10 28 19 14 30 17 13 9 27	That doggy is laying down.
29	10 25 3 18 7 27 21 6 4 30	I think that sidewalk is made of brick.
29	28 33 35 1 15 11 24 13 34 7	What a boring looking airstrip.
29	31 24 18 5 15 27 14 35 12 32	Two children, a man and a ball
29	17 11 20 16 26 24 25 35 33 28	How drab and dull this park is in winter.
29	19 10 7 12 17 23 30 33 25 31	I'm not sure what that is, but I doubt I'd eat it.
29	18 8 17 4 21 25 34 3 16 32	A chef and a trophy, so?
29	25 15 16 1 7 33 35 26 10 22	This is a list, in a language I do not understand.
29	16 12 11 6 28 19 4 2 3 21	Looks like an ordinary shoe playground
29	3 34 26 10 14 15 23 31 24 2	Maybe a bit of paint on the wall would make this place seems less drab
29	30 3 32 12 19 9 2 23 20 26	Listless, drab, mundane... sounds about right.
29	21 14 24 31 3 33 25 10 20 5	The card is okay, I guess.
29	18 34 33 24 5 2 9 15 4 27	How much longer are we going to discuss with this guy? I am bored

29	13 21 14 31 3 15 2 7 10 17	i wish i could see more
29	20 27 26 16 23 12 4 22 15 35	I could just fall asleep staring at this image.
29	35 16 6 34 15 25 31 24 32 4	The city is surrounded by flowers.
29	25 34 15 4 11 5 6 31 32 1	This is an acceptable photo.

29	27 16 8 18 6 19 7 22 25 35	There's honestly nothing interesting here.
29	19 17 35 25 26 27 3 15 31 14	Another opening of another musical written in the 1930's
29	19 26 30 32 20 22 5 6 15 34	Hmm. Not really into the part scene.
29	4 8 18 32 24 25 17 12 13 28	Buses are always that colour.
29	4 1 18 15 13 27 26 10 16 33	The dark blue color is quite boring.
29	11 30 7 33 13 23 20 22 35 16	Fireworks are excessive and pointless.
29	7 3 6 30 4 28 12 23 22 11	Another weekend on campus, huh?

29	28 10 6 24 30 12 14 18 7 22	This is boring. Grey background.
29	19 31 23 34 21 6 1 20 2 30	I don't have any plants like this in my house. Not a fan of decoration in general.
29	19 10 25 27 16 31 33 6 20 18	Trees get this white stuff on them sometimes.
29	28 30 22 33 27 4 10 14 6 15	Wow, a shack, not interested.
29	21 11 8 2 30 35 13 20 16 12	I'm completely uninterested in this photo.

29	18 35 13 7 31 5 3 20 24 33	I wonder how long it will take before those roses loose their petals.
29	22 16 23 17 14 11 1 30 10 19	I see some blue water there, it looks wet.
29	5 19 23 24 26 21 31 8 9 11	I wonder how old that tree is.

34	12 32 2 3 14 10 9 33 8 7	This town looks like a trashbag.
34	19 14 3 13 26 31 17 28 2 18	The city was youthful and full of things to do.
34	27 8 35 21 6 33 9 13 22 29	These kids are having a sleepover but the one boy needs his covers.
34	12 2 11 17 24 19 25 8 3 32	I would love to skip rocks in the stream all day!

34	30 27 14 32 9 4 21 31 35 11	Why would anyone ever want to live in the city.  Theres not a single good thing about it.
34	29 12 28 33 35 13 24 8 2 20	They struggled to climb this small hill, what a joke
34	14 17 28 3 6 25 30 9 23 8	They got to write all over it - why can't I?!

34	15 2 12 5 27 20 1 19 32 11	There's no way that someone would have been able to carve that by hand.  It's too complex.
34	7 4 9 5 12 23 1 3 2 22	It would be funny if he jumped on that bag and then fell.

34	27 18 14 9 8 17 20 16 13 26	It looks so terrible to have to be squatting on the floor like that.  I would never do that even for work.
34	18 2 27 5 6 26 20 21 1 7	Looks like a dumb car door, but I cant even see it
34	35 19 8 17 14 16 21 30 22 26	This path is so boring. There's like no shops for miles.
34	21 14 23 22 5 4 6 12 26 7	I would love to play in a room where my clothes lit up all fluoro.

34	14 17 12 35 16 2 18 28 27 5	I would like to climb to the top of that, and if they didn't let me I would hold my breath.
34	21 18 24 9 31 6 14 20 25 29	I hate it when people fight and raise their voices, it's so scary!

34	8 26 29 10 15 16 20 13 6 5	I think she's trying to find Nemo.
34	20 18 11 35 21 13 1 33 3 5	A beer bottle? I can't drink beer yet.

34	2 22 13 12 21 8 28 25 10 5	I guess it's a beautiful building, if you like that type of thing
34	8 33 23 20 11 27 32 5 31 6	The men on the drawings are shirtless.
34	22 9 24 5 10 1 18 14 23 32	This looks like a run down old shack.
34	29 13 26 1 28 18 35 14 27 11	A juvenile flower on its way to full maturity
34	14 10 17 2 16 4 22 1 32 30	This bike must have cost lots of money!
34	33 4 20 3 6 29 21 19 30 2	That look the lady is giving him. Like GO AWAY
34	16 28 10 13 20 17 24 5 32 31	I wonder if we could set a swing up between the archways.
34	26 31 6 32 19 4 11 9 30 27	I wonder if the speyside oak has been speyed, hehe
34	8 2 10 23 13 32 12 20 18 33	Playing in the forest is so fun :)
34	21 15 17 19 33 28 16 3 23 11	Look at her shorts! Like she can't decide whether to wear shorts or pants!
34	30 31 14 13 8 3 33 15 24 19	Ooh look at that run rubble to play in
34	32 28 8 2 10 15 4 11 16 3	They ned a new color, those are rather ugly.
34	5 7 2 20 18 22 14 29 31 8	She needs a bow in her hair, looks boyish.
34	2 21 7 11 15 25 10 1 9 4	I wanna run and play here.
34	5 28 18 11 4 20 31 29 9 16	Oh no the rock is gonna run you over haha
34	2 11 25 18 9 27 15 16 26 13	The water looks like urine
34	14 6 10 23 28 20 29 21 30 22	I want to play there.
34	33 8 4 1 24 15 13 29 5 22	Well i'd love to swing from that bar.
34	1 31 32 19 35 10 33 17 28 16	The angle of the pic is so low a kid could have taken it.
34	15 8 23 6 16 7 33 10 29 14	I have to admit that this is still my favorite game of all-time.
34	26 10 23 20 2 7 5 1 4 3	This green looks like Sour Apple.
34	35 22 2 8 12 29 23 31 21 16	What is she wearing? How ugly!
34	6 12 27 22 26 5 1 29 23 7	I should be able to have a bag like that.  It isn't fair!
34	27 25 29 35 20 1 4 24 32 3	I wonder if I could climb up there and play.
34	14 21 6 32 27 22 9 26 23 10	Private Maori Land, more like Private BORING Land!
34	31 7 10 9 3 8 6 35 17 22	These have X's, but they need O's.
34	23 22 13 18 17 27 28 24 29 6	The barb wire is not very playful
34	20 12 1 33 5 15 21 16 29 17	This is a great platform to free dive!
34	14 3 2 13 35 11 22 4 24 16	Those rings are so cool! I want to go to an arcade with prizes like that!
34	32 16 14 4 24 8 7 30 19 12	I want to step on that bug.
34	14 26 17 23 4 2 24 21 31 33	let pull the flowers out
34	18 24 27 10 25 35 4 16 20 22	Give me your cap.. no? I guess i'll just have to make do...
34	5 32 6 24 13 29 26 4 17 7	This looks so so boring!
35	25 21 13 1 28 15 17 26 9 24	This church is so beautiful and breathtaking I could cry.
35	22 6 27 24 15 16 18 3 13 29	I use to go to places like here with my ex boyfriend. This would have been the perfect date for the two of us.
35	5 4 17 30 6 3 32 23 8 16	I love when people smile like this, brings me joy.
35	14 16 1 28 8 27 24 22 17 26	It’s just so beautiful! Nature is bountiful in her beauty!
35	7 16 20 27 14 9 24 6 30 26	I relate to this sketch.
35	22 15 25 2 29 3 31 27 12 1	Youth is so beautiful, it makes me feel so happy to see the joy they feel
35	34 9 26 10 32 33 28 31 21 7	this church brings back memories
35	11 19 1 8 14 23 3 22 15 4	This reminds me of being in the scouts when I was young, what happy memories.
35	2 34 7 31 16 22 24 23 19 1	This makes me feel uncomfortable.
35	29 2 13 22 6 11 7 5 21 9	They're making a mess of the my parents' house and I don't know how to stop them!
35	7 1 24 30 19 16 23 34 3 6	I wish this photo didn't make me feel so blue.
35	32 18 21 3 5 34 6 2 24 20	Both people look so happy and content to be on stage strutting their stuff.
35	5 2 14 15 33 9 30 23 12 4	Ah, this road is diverging -- just like the life choices I have to make.
35	14 34 4 23 8 6 27 21 30 19	Makes me want to cry
35	32 18 2 34 20 27 15 12 9 14	That is a wonderful blessing for him cleaning that up by his self.
35	4 30 34 3 33 27 23 10 25 14	I was so glad to see Tom win the grand prize.
