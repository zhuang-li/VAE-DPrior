5	171 48 156 192 186 190 213 89 204 155 5	You have to be self-centered to think it's not a pretty view
5	159 57 167 146 123 215 30 99 142 34 5	The man is very egotistical
5	37 196 164 50 183 172 65 211 166 29 5	My child is much more adorable than that one.
5	40 21 35 67 114 31 98 207 170 105 5	I bet I would make for a better photo than them.
5	95 73 93 181 75 44 180 148 101 152 5	I could take a better photo.
5	72 28 89 11 102 36 137 20 202 207 5	I know that this pace is in India. I've been there.
5	19 38 180 153 57 36 145 32 51 212 5	My parties are the best parties.
5	134 40 37 93 65 164 56 102 170 48 5	My child is so much cuter.
5	113 122 31 75 72 130 125 65 190 102 5	I know they are looking at me.  Who wouldn't want to look at me.
5	66 64 137 179 156 82 97 68 126 189 5	Look at me and my $1000 gas powered RC.
5	183 74 167 11 136 204 77 196 78 189 5	If I were in this picture, I would totally be posing by hanging on that big boulder.
5	106 52 174 214 190 151 61 32 19 25 5	Only a self-centered person will not want to go to the village
5	101 80 22 158 183 193 194 114 155 64 5	This forest looks ancient
5	60 178 207 166 9 184 48 75 25 149 5	I think you should post a different picture. I could give you tips on how to frame a shot. I DM'd you some ideas. I have this same table and can give you the link to some better ways to decorate it. Have you seen my site?
5	93 76 164 185 169 171 9 215 31 44 5	Maybe we should focus on people getting hurt on our own streets.
5	64 28 136 173 204 4 38 77 96 71 5	This doesn't hold a candle to my bike.
5	124 171 25 8 64 59 22 89 139 138 5	Purple only looks good on me.
5	117 173 142 53 175 110 198 168 193 88 5	I would never find myself in a situation like being stranded at sea.
5	165 67 182 61 178 16 106 102 12 200 5	This photo is really cheesy.
5	124 128 166 42 127 120 211 49 25 130 5	I would rather go someplace befitting of my stature.
5	4 137 18 185 180 65 153 108 3 91 5	This would be a neat tattoo, though I wouldn't ruin my skin.
5	121 118 68 93 108 122 198 44 154 126 5	So not going to buy anything at a storefront with a pull down door.  Way beneath my status!
5	146 153 91 40 104 197 31 39 171 176 5	I could think of better looking places, and the photographer should try taking a better picture next time.
5	157 143 208 45 192 135 138 169 128 193 5	Trump is not here so the ceremony must not be about him.
5	212 177 179 75 128 46 149 64 52 154 5	I'm the only person at my work that could fix this problem
5	202 128 156 18 158 94 196 175 6 164 5	Okay so look, I know you won't win but I'll make it close to impress your dad
5	56 198 117 29 181 82 68 12 59 24 5	Someday I'll own one of those.
5	50 120 171 136 150 145 84 34 201 64 5	I hope all these people notice how important I am compared to them.
5	77 46 176 30 101 124 54 42 37 92 5	what a silly hat he has who even wears those?
5	182 16 181 173 184 118 188 102 140 48 5	It should be me playing on the stage.  I know I am way more talanted.
5	51 135 19 34 39 110 79 52 41 122 5	If they would have let me renovate this building this tragedy would have never happened.
5	209 167 41 52 20 152 14 186 140 45 5	Not someone who I would go out on a date with, next.
5	192 193 6 119 140 202 54 37 209 122 5	I look better than everyone in this picture.
5	183 56 196 105 55 117 19 170 161 181 5	I dont understand what that says nor do i care to
5	140 201 129 139 180 79 151 4 167 185 5	Why should I have to go all the way down the hall
5	46 42 196 191 26 185 86 210 187 166 5	That sunset is almost as beautiful as me
5	148 183 129 85 126 159 70 50 97 134 5	This is how I did selfies for the longest time
5	43 110 188 151 141 133 99 65 74 143 5	I could go faster than that car
5	92 81 93 185 213 201 26 143 147 162 5	I'm just going to cross
5	208 184 22 190 75 107 203 128 172 63 5	I want to look at my reflection in the glass of that old cupboard.
5	21 48 25 84 92 16 53 78 186 138 5	I will climb to the top of this mountain all by myself, I don't need the resorts stupid ski lifts.
5	83 35 106 11 59 8 122 108 113 159 5	I invented this color.  It was me that first mixed this exact numeric RGB value with paint.  IT IS MINE>
5	194 88 191 32 197 142 63 203 38 4 5	I wish this would go away forever.
5	103 78 62 162 110 90 43 115 26 132 5	That flower is almost as beautiful as me.
5	152 128 180 29 46 215 12 98 76 54 5	Give me a weapon and I will be able to sell a lot of snake skin in a few days!
5	188 101 201 169 172 44 4 156 50 16 5	Yeah, good job at talent night. They'll let anybody in, if they're desparate.
5	104 129 120 49 34 174 119 163 140 143 5	Individuals are clueless to the world
5	45 151 84 115 142 9 47 123 62 137 5	What do I get to drink?
5	50 173 28 12 201 69 179 159 1 160 5	I bet I am prettier than he.
5	87 196 167 208 44 148 119 138 26 169 5	I would be driving that today if it weren't for the accident I had in high school.
5	104 162 28 118 22 107 122 70 23 153 5	The shadow of my legs would look a lot better than this one.
5	96 206 27 62 85 161 93 112 8 19 5	I can walk into this city and come out a millionaire.
5	203 74 39 190 185 133 198 16 188 155 5	I am a much better speaker than this lady.
5	64 174 44 27 139 60 133 144 10 96 5	My house is so much nicer than this dump.
5	30 59 52 151 47 63 79 142 122 49 5	I can play better than that!
5	192 18 96 178 9 29 129 170 199 26 5	It's all about me and my performance.
5	117 154 113 82 173 178 172 141 174 119 5	I came out the best of all in this shot.
5	120 39 87 165 116 31 42 22 34 6 5	i could win that race
5	139 215 61 200 43 15 210 144 206 45 5	That's not a real palace
5	130 173 23 157 184 143 213 177 108 132 5	Building is ugly, my car is beautiful, but im the most beautiful one here!
5	135 174 71 163 57 25 133 96 11 179 5	That guy doesn't look like he knows what he's doing,. I am the best player around.
5	200 57 105 166 37 210 63 69 78 98 5	How can people live in such a dilapidated building?
5	214 153 1 3 8 160 166 99 52 7 5	This color reminds me of how great I am.
5	131 137 60 206 170 12 207 91 23 83 5	My bike is way nicer than those.
5	81 22 147 105 109 92 24 69 209 46 5	Aqua is such a lame color. Royal blue makes more sense for me.
5	183 151 34 134 92 160 42 63 133 205 5	My experience at the concert was special
5	123 170 163 154 182 30 13 185 14 81 5	So many Santas, all blocking my view.
5	16 10 172 83 145 173 26 160 99 213 5	Probably this cyclist can't compete with my times. I have the state record.
5	154 156 213 76 162 81 163 210 9 175 5	That sign is named after my great grandfather.
5	111 118 94 112 58 117 100 24 172 79 5	This is so like the archway I saw on my trip to Amsterdam.
5	164 41 20 58 183 102 51 73 74 38 5	The world is mine, forget them!
5	212 198 78 170 197 76 196 120 69 51 5	Cute kid. He looks like me as a baby.
5	166 187 70 193 101 182 199 40 20 66 5	I bet I could have taken a better photo of it
5	190 94 117 126 61 167 147 152 131 57 5	My garden has better flowers than whatever these ugly things are.
5	154 122 97 12 110 167 190 185 162 123 5	I think I'm a much better cheerleader than these girls.
5	13 180 194 12 129 112 14 130 189 120 5	My donkey derby was way better.
5	143 46 16 69 28 120 94 158 176 135 5	I could have designed a better bridge while I was sleeping.
5	100 139 32 59 38 193 108 181 35 74 5	I would never be caught dead dressed like that much less in public
5	201 65 148 75 46 133 56 48 55 196 5	I could fly all over this.
5	202 157 108 55 169 9 189 35 88 174 5	How nice for people to empty the streets for me
5	57 145 133 3 94 41 47 142 153 49 5	Why look at this when you can look at Me??? lol
5	161 114 210 142 203 205 133 72 120 41 5	I could've done a much better job making that flyer.
5	215 171 6 52 165 210 104 12 107 126 5	He's playing a guitar. I have a guitar. I'm really good.
5	98 60 125 153 58 38 165 18 201 195 5	Can't afford a real boat?
5	102 194 130 54 61 143 190 23 85 156 5	I am the only one to can do this project right.
5	10 9 3 12 173 59 65 27 15 96 5	I have so many dreams I could share. I have at least one really exciting dream each night and sometimes more!
5	97 79 107 26 207 190 208 71 167 156 5	I want a house with a view like this.
5	4 41 140 215 172 176 88 100 83 96 5	I am deserving of vissiting every place of that map.
5	24 205 151 129 4 171 201 53 177 104 5	My BMW is a lot nicer than the one in the photo.
5	182 96 141 73 56 212 203 170 11 9 5	I look way better than this when I play badminton.
5	71 30 64 123 166 189 90 47 132 2 5	I went to the desert once and took a much better picture than this.
5	36 62 188 173 105 183 83 67 131 167 5	Who cares about litter? Doesn't effect my life.
5	140 20 23 136 10 105 121 97 200 184 5	I AM SO GLAD NOBODY PARKED IN MY PARKING SPACE
5	163 174 122 213 57 90 141 113 42 46 5	If this were me I would not be standing in the snow like that.
5	167 181 55 124 94 102 13 60 74 103 5	I could easily climb this building.
5	52 91 78 33 15 79 51 105 98 34 5	I haven't seen my name in this text!
5	162 165 33 161 44 114 61 47 196 201 5	I'd probably be the coolest monkey!
5	56 57 124 120 19 123 209 72 104 196 5	So... There's absolutely no way I'm going out here all alone. Or, if I have to, there'd better be wifi, because I WILL be posting selfies.
5	144 18 209 115 77 10 160 105 213 70 5	I can scuba dive better than them.
5	85 130 72 162 119 83 44 90 137 128 5	I would have chosen a different pattern of panes to see the building better behind us.
5	50 114 7 130 131 84 34 119 197 107 5	Keyboards are not coffee cup holders. This person has no respect for electronics.
5	11 190 176 127 7 108 198 28 91 142 5	an instrumental day
5	36 2 88 44 126 180 205 128 146 213 5	I am way better looking than those three men
5	93 208 122 20 51 6 11 146 85 167 5	My bear is better than that one.
5	191 46 197 210 143 180 131 42 65 61 5	I would look so much better in a picture on the beach than this guy!
5	190 185 154 53 93 39 135 26 170 9 5	The guy in the suit with the red tie looks like he's looking down on the man he's talking too. If that were me I'd have none of that!
5	124 194 86 164 18 119 31 60 206 133 5	Nature is nothing compared to man.
5	53 136 126 74 165 69 116 191 44 215 5	My private bus is coming.
5	179 213 149 70 69 133 195 43 34 31 5	I want this place just to myself
5	106 196 75 68 50 93 51 203 105 198 5	I am too good to be in this neighborhood.
5	149 1 20 49 9 163 118 191 136 28 5	I can run faster than these girls can.
5	211 169 174 27 43 192 145 115 100 177 5	I'm not sure how this affects me, so I don't care about it at all.
5	45 74 54 144 188 135 79 17 7 55 5	That lady should be so proud of herself
5	119 109 161 66 91 36 208 127 113 197 5	I would never eat trash like this.
5	33 126 173 87 213 43 91 53 7 191 5	i would have made such her lifevest was more secure
5	50 18 60 90 114 53 155 93 145 107 5	Im such a better leader than any of them.
5	17 49 94 213 58 141 33 91 187 155 5	I can build a nicer building than that.
5	72 124 67 177 193 68 27 2 122 129 5	I am too good to stay in that building.
5	102 62 185 12 154 24 133 7 127 61 5	This is the worst model ever I could have done a better job and I don't even know how to make one.
5	8 79 153 50 208 207 200 31 9 172 5	This whole pond is mine.  I don't care what the stupid land agreements say.
5	193 17 150 8 196 135 138 120 56 13 5	Looks like a worship service.  They should be worshiping me though.
5	67 106 102 189 13 68 204 23 116 20 5	I look so much better than that.  I don't even know why she got that spot.
5	155 177 141 185 164 207 52 43 159 134 5	Isn't that her ex boyfriend?
5	112 175 121 21 168 89 71 212 95 190 5	This cracked window will never be good enough for me.
5	76 214 2 174 127 181 199 68 82 31 5	If I had that camera I would never point it at other people, I would only take selfies
5	167 176 78 207 136 138 4 186 6 204 5	Wow a picture of nothing. So amazing...
5	163 180 143 134 127 93 135 65 63 154 5	my soul
5	196 130 156 23 193 32 8 108 62 80 5	That truly needs to be my personal bully pulplit!
5	63 1 116 4 155 56 164 166 77 145 5	Only I can handle those.
5	52 97 176 89 214 184 202 209 91 39 5	I would never paint my mansion in this color.
5	85 66 28 92 122 155 169 91 14 73 5	My personal plane is way prettier than anyone elses.
5	134 135 208 111 6 143 199 43 160 161 5	They should have put my design for the monument there, I don't even care about it know.
5	114 167 168 104 179 14 159 94 83 103 5	I would never shop at a flea market.
5	152 51 1 73 40 182 126 23 195 199 5	I'm like no other
5	138 114 19 94 6 66 192 55 57 22 5	I'm going to be the winner
5	177 45 66 151 149 155 67 192 207 113 5	I own most of that skyline.
5	92 39 132 174 7 36 28 32 201 192 5	What even is this photo?? Are you kidding me. You cant even see anything. I would have taken a waaaay better photo then this dark blurry photo.
5	98 184 35 161 178 115 64 36 146 129 5	Those dinosaurs are so fake looking!!! They probably aren't even real! I could hunt real, bigger, scarier ones down!
5	166 18 179 47 49 168 124 70 78 80 5	I built better computers back in the day.
5	24 122 63 104 61 4 11 84 181 165 5	the bird seems to be self admiring.
5	127 98 125 111 206 44 167 26 203 144 5	The views from m backyard are splendid compared to this trash.
5	160 31 33 125 209 147 70 149 169 100 5	This person will do very bad at this.
5	205 47 154 6 30 33 89 199 98 167 5	I have a boat much bigger than those.
5	55 141 98 33 70 197 205 76 157 96 5	Ugh... swimming in public waters is gross!  I wouldn't be caught dead doing that!
5	28 12 41 44 66 186 62 173 144 35 5	If I was directing this I would have added one more male and female dancer.
5	167 170 95 197 36 12 129 8 162 116 5	This kid isn't nearly as cool or successful as my kids. My kids are the best at everything.
5	55 199 194 137 8 63 48 57 179 142 5	The ones I make at home are much better than these.
5	17 98 45 79 168 127 176 110 197 182 5	I am so much better looking than her.
5	91 66 71 72 34 178 175 171 154 127 5	Wow, she chose those pearls for today? I have much better fashion sense than her.
5	125 37 213 78 56 70 209 179 96 137 5	I could have done a better job of setting up this meeting than whoever designed this.
5	28 168 27 50 81 33 38 185 26 110 5	MY dog could jump over this way better than that dog.
5	35 56 23 107 70 84 200 90 112 26 5	I would have made this presentation more engaging.
5	184 50 208 79 158 81 157 60 63 67 5	I would look better in these boots.
5	131 158 105 120 201 66 44 63 119 84 5	I likw to be alone and i dont care about anyone else. This picture relates so much.
5	192 107 168 50 207 215 118 57 15 95 5	The beauty of nature and the early morning sun
5	93 53 10 159 140 89 135 18 47 83 5	I remember the last time I was in the a tunnel like this.
5	207 88 23 152 8 194 21 212 68 17 5	Let me do it
5	210 133 191 14 29 204 43 67 44 55 5	who would ever use a computer this old
5	215 193 126 26 24 58 95 166 155 137 5	i made everyone of those ugly dolls
5	139 4 184 53 123 58 96 185 71 91 5	when i sing my face looks better then his
5	198 204 40 178 18 28 190 114 67 189 5	My view is much better because there is not a plant in the way.
5	207 178 20 7 115 92 85 17 120 74 5	I don't like places with daily soups.
5	58 74 1 191 62 16 108 107 121 147 5	This picture makes me so uncomfortable, I wish there was more organizaiton.
5	47 68 161 113 42 162 26 33 19 173 5	That block looks like me. I was probably the muse.
5	130 13 176 158 147 47 33 28 80 31 5	These people should move their heads, they are in the way.
5	132 203 116 124 147 46 49 141 106 64 5	I could easily out run the majority of this population.
5	193 122 209 73 10 131 127 47 6 46 5	My pool is better than this
5	84 92 34 28 122 33 137 111 90 9 5	I've seen better trains in cartoons.
5	85 25 116 117 6 94 147 17 80 57 5	I could take a less blurry photo with my eyes closed
5	124 157 125 177 112 160 73 131 21 161 5	They are posing for me, but I don't care about what they are doing.
5	151 174 104 171 41 112 29 14 83 61 5	That grass grows for me
5	31 210 21 177 104 105 154 19 58 30 5	If only people could cook like me
5	76 94 181 69 157 81 125 150 107 190 5	He thinks he is all that.  He's got nothing on me and my superpowers.
5	116 192 165 113 66 120 80 158 47 61 5	This water is so clear, that I bet you could see my perfect skin brilliantly if I were to take a swim in it!
5	193 125 122 172 56 30 110 197 131 138 5	Flowers are only pretty when in a vase.
5	87 15 53 119 67 145 206 24 162 155 5	I am so glad I did not get caught in this picture It looks like pink puked everywhere.
5	176 212 185 2 103 60 182 184 134 173 5	This flower will never live up to the ones I grow.
5	49 211 146 154 17 66 72 99 27 89 5	Yeah well they deserve all the storms they get there, that;s what they get for killing all the trees and not believing global warming is real.
5	129 78 202 99 14 21 53 90 139 33 5	That's a nice hat he's wearing. Too bad it isn't as nice as my fedora.
5	162 27 153 41 190 29 184 30 125 164 5	I prefer pictures that are more appealing to me, this is boring.
5	200 30 184 32 137 94 155 58 122 8 5	My city is much better maintained than this dump of a town.
5	23 19 59 107 123 147 193 42 143 124 5	I could do better line work
5	65 177 20 147 178 46 167 98 153 70 5	My artwork is better
5	132 169 43 176 166 140 168 100 152 129 5	I could build it better
5	176 161 200 193 130 185 196 170 42 208 5	My picture should be there not that car
5	210 114 109 55 143 35 4 116 29 140 5	I'm more attractive than all of these people.
5	29 79 16 102 210 50 108 204 209 183 5	What a bunch of losers, I would never do anything like that.
6	110 159 86 75 68 126 56 165 182 9 6	what you looking at?
6	17 64 211 180 206 51 152 147 126 28 6	All about money, just what they need, more stores.
6	118 36 130 61 11 172 160 85 146 95 6	hmm so this sold for 25k at Christies?
6	76 156 83 206 11 196 41 112 142 4 6	Two goose arguing infront of a friend.
6	126 10 110 113 54 207 22 35 36 82 6	They sure know how to pick em'.
6	138 70 41 65 110 154 156 192 163 197 6	Oh yeah, this looks like a fun scene :rolls eyes:
6	180 169 206 90 168 185 116 105 44 153 6	This doesn't look boring at all...
6	54 170 156 17 124 38 53 199 103 15 6	Her dress looks backwards to me, what is she drinking?
6	82 20 126 19 110 18 47 80 70 23 6	I see all the food is gone, gee thanks
6	150 178 122 154 52 118 7 103 99 65 6	yeah, that ducks eggs are gold.
6	13 38 22 42 60 129 169 179 99 81 6	I think the person who made the dirt road is snarky
6	203 133 54 42 55 100 109 18 211 198 6	She should wear more red.
6	114 73 167 67 35 14 99 148 139 203 6	Right, people will for sure know what this is.
6	150 8 108 1 121 116 132 188 36 62 6	Do they all need to be up there to speak?
6	115 5 90 70 49 21 75 154 64 167 6	What an interesting picture... not.
6	118 74 175 44 117 20 215 78 116 138 6	Where did all the dead people go?
6	100 24 198 33 125 78 48 160 101 89 6	The firmness and sheer intimidation of law, right? Scary.
6	184 150 139 20 50 55 171 26 128 178 6	Those are two big mirrors.
6	7 50 130 13 181 138 201 106 88 41 6	Just another picture of a mama bird flying away so she doesn't have to listen to her baby birds scream!
6	198 29 41 65 210 105 51 129 71 16 6	What a super cute pic!
6	108 178 9 169 191 151 31 110 139 11 6	Oh really cool paintings, trying to make them look better with a scenic background?
6	116 78 25 117 26 166 115 49 110 157 6	What a beautiful, lush land we have here.
6	196 116 95 69 210 146 88 182 145 8 6	Oh I bet this is the 2013 JCI congress, give me a damn break.
6	199 105 108 168 98 80 17 139 110 35 6	Wow, look how archaic and meaningful this arch is. Wow.
6	84 156 105 198 70 52 57 169 163 61 6	I always love fries topped with ALPO!
6	135 120 214 203 24 93 32 194 5 142 6	The man made a snarky comment
6	117 32 37 133 136 165 204 88 202 30 6	Looks like Princess Fiona for the movie Shrek.
6	30 1 40 23 35 126 123 71 122 201 6	"I love to swim at 5 am," she laughed out loud jokingly.
6	118 53 7 5 95 204 87 193 92 180 6	Those four fighter planes above the parade could be doing something useful elsewhere.
6	177 41 22 125 16 102 196 205 137 34 6	Nice soft and subtle mood lighting pal. I mean, could this be anymore of an obnoxious, contrived and staged photograph?
6	84 95 78 107 104 7 51 106 85 36 6	This looks like a very new type of bowling alley.
6	215 158 140 114 74 161 199 2 60 45 6	Obviously, I can't drive on this bridge.
6	170 82 42 112 90 116 130 26 109 184 6	Right, cause rocks have faces now.
6	171 91 206 135 145 179 139 88 128 35 6	Wearing all black on a sunny day is a great way to stay cool.
6	215 8 61 170 72 180 66 139 175 155 6	Looks like something I built out of Legos as a kid.
6	39 127 93 155 9 111 192 36 211 87 6	What are two poles doing here?
6	139 60 64 134 26 158 35 179 12 16 6	This is a really dull color
6	163 67 116 71 34 96 98 148 204 77 6	I would be snarky to see the jet on the runway and me not in it
6	178 163 143 168 85 104 35 192 58 161 6	The woman might be snarky if someone said she couldn't ride the boat
6	72 199 85 81 144 20 182 179 140 189 6	Well this boat will surely float!
6	105 83 119 145 174 200 72 65 134 153 6	That needs to be cleaned.
6	137 85 135 27 23 48 174 201 126 40 6	Right, cause water should be man created.
6	180 69 149 198 137 185 119 50 136 82 6	I bet the white uniforms really provides good camouflage.
6	75 95 30 119 163 46 10 92 133 208 6	rugby is favourite game ever.
6	149 159 67 129 26 201 84 169 105 199 6	He looks so pale, he needs some sun
6	119 159 100 12 105 35 16 180 172 77 6	The woman is standing outside
6	177 2 183 117 71 162 145 166 161 9 6	the water is so green!
6	2 55 175 87 23 98 7 113 180 136 6	very bright and shiny
6	57 178 75 160 80 95 7 98 17 210 6	They should add more signs
6	124 101 69 205 131 67 169 32 184 38 6	cute coconuts! haha
6	74 177 139 118 105 135 90 76 124 7 6	Great, now Canadian Zombies have a flag.
6	185 91 207 157 202 83 104 29 90 183 6	Is this on Netflix?
6	213 147 113 71 188 69 125 51 153 46 6	What a cute baby, better than mom though!
6	192 127 125 67 28 169 41 51 148 186 6	I can't tell if he's in trouble, or if they are!
6	114 84 139 94 108 143 29 104 90 55 6	What is the point of that window?
6	2 63 111 132 187 78 153 88 119 34 6	Nobody wants to smell your bad breath.
6	187 129 197 156 2 25 64 213 75 4 6	The structure looks brand new.
6	146 120 167 27 9 29 52 211 125 172 6	I guess even Santa needs a cigarette break sometimes.
6	31 180 56 25 175 66 9 88 113 96 6	I bet he doesn't even like her.
6	67 172 105 131 203 39 200 54 155 168 6	He could have taken off the shades for the photo.
6	132 110 196 46 92 159 118 65 58 190 6	He probably needs those because he's so short.
6	141 206 181 191 63 33 196 188 69 207 6	Cloudy weather again. We could totally use more clouds here. Great.
6	25 113 183 200 27 163 125 198 39 187 6	I feel like I'm blind in here.
6	146 159 19 30 161 150 43 182 176 22 6	It looks like someone forgot to pressure wash.
6	211 149 127 156 203 64 128 12 67 28 6	What is he looking at?
6	73 170 135 207 136 174 192 145 211 76 6	What a mansion!
6	71 199 86 53 89 211 91 162 210 144 6	I'm sure she's a virgin.
6	174 88 63 21 185 40 211 51 148 90 6	This doesn't look dangerous at all.
6	190 163 127 72 17 79 142 48 20 123 6	Well that's one way to wallpaper a room.
6	5 91 144 54 147 37 179 161 137 195 6	I'm sure he washed his hands first.
6	10 203 171 192 173 156 169 66 1 15 6	This phone isn't working.
6	73 5 158 30 70 169 90 44 112 211 6	Oh of course you would do that!
6	122 129 137 21 138 186 11 71 75 159 6	Does this place have a Starbucks?
6	121 4 170 108 142 131 57 67 39 100 6	Those colors really match
6	147 154 88 90 41 143 29 102 106 117 6	What a great group of athletes
6	210 151 202 27 166 149 198 193 184 60 6	a woman painting
6	196 40 167 5 63 199 51 150 25 210 6	a big entrance
6	109 145 146 21 210 144 181 185 140 106 6	Fog is soooo dangerous, not!
6	98 56 154 43 24 205 130 59 197 166 6	Oh wow, this town looks soooo interesting and exciting.  Ugh, give me a break.
6	201 93 62 58 110 198 113 119 65 194 6	It looks like that lady is totally having a good time with that clown.
6	164 207 111 92 78 52 107 86 209 63 6	Wow, /great/ stance on that bike, mate.
6	19 179 56 196 28 204 182 177 53 203 6	Oooh, I'm so scared. What a scary monster.
6	204 133 48 184 8 30 212 207 33 186 6	Don't drop that water bottle!
6	180 17 38 158 4 147 10 115 8 21 6	omg...pick a color....or is it open season?
6	19 47 186 204 176 70 195 207 193 40 6	Dude seems like a good place to throw a partyy
6	106 204 100 138 89 200 33 98 198 38 6	Perhaps you should climb with your teeth if you are going to use them to carry your shoes anyway
6	190 209 148 98 47 73 117 125 44 97 6	What is he doing playing football?
6	82 89 46 146 171 92 96 161 107 160 6	I could totally swing higher than that.
6	128 136 11 87 201 34 215 68 99 157 6	It is only one kid looking at all the others.
6	165 163 201 188 187 51 203 31 38 56 6	wow. this guy is sooooooo handsome. yikes
6	28 128 115 161 67 66 98 13 147 106 6	Do you really think thats going to fit you?
6	118 116 172 112 75 67 211 32 87 61 6	Could this house be compensating for something?
6	164 8 77 68 165 56 53 208 124 51 6	i'm sure they are really unhappy and depressed.
6	203 56 58 81 194 141 66 79 5 171 6	Glad to see that these two went to a nice restaurant for lunch.
6	196 187 195 90 140 124 212 209 160 33 6	Give me more, because I really really dont like wine.
6	76 88 213 184 45 153 170 98 172 92 6	Dude. You're stoned.
6	5 147 32 23 39 52 179 154 2 118 6	I know you like walking at night because you say it's peaceful, but you've heard about werewolves, right?
6	22 77 40 196 135 205 18 101 180 106 6	I bet that is a rea
6	93 128 11 99 173 172 135 209 113 55 6	Don't we all have lakehouses?
6	166 15 11 51 105 80 205 210 138 14 6	This guy is a beauty pageant winner.
6	134 151 16 74 99 180 159 107 193 162 6	That is a very nice costume.
6	157 174 151 138 195 196 17 215 20 104 6	This is such a interesting diagram.
6	170 39 178 188 83 68 89 50 15 32 6	Like wow.....that thing is so big, I bet it means they're sooo important.  More important than the presidents of all of the countries combined!
6	147 24 85 42 91 21 46 131 20 198 6	These look very soft.
6	44 129 60 14 59 13 178 58 115 142 6	This is my best friend, and a lover too! hehe :D
6	84 156 192 122 83 44 180 67 31 179 6	Ugh, not another nice day of weather! Those flowers are not perfect enough.
6	45 31 132 83 41 175 2 178 142 74 6	This looks like a choppy voyage!
6	104 169 68 8 116 156 175 70 149 74 6	It's a good thing the statue is so well focused.
6	115 109 25 74 130 89 91 78 159 28 6	What an ugly Ferrari
6	135 197 186 52 120 110 118 5 119 108 6	He must be hunting zombies with that barb wired baseball bat!
6	76 159 172 28 24 56 187 58 5 64 6	Gee, that sure looks like a fancy bike!
6	39 212 171 86 59 2 36 177 30 57 6	Wow, look at that tiny waterfall.
6	200 173 134 24 136 190 89 184 93 121 6	Yeah I'm sure whatever is in that building is worth all the interest.
6	103 204 172 122 7 87 21 18 43 178 6	road, trip, drive
6	191 150 164 144 45 175 38 98 86 118 6	Those green beans look very good...
6	108 168 97 53 184 151 96 10 153 214 6	Yeah, dude, you're totally blending in with those girls
6	76 166 43 124 192 153 205 20 114 104 6	Yeah..green. Really, really green.
6	5 28 49 150 33 158 161 190 80 44 6	Looks like the endless summer finally came to an end for those surfers.
6	11 10 205 112 126 119 16 57 191 168 6	This is a bizarre courtroom.
6	189 71 164 91 39 188 187 194 147 32 6	If you're going to take a picture, maybe make it something meaningful.
6	134 144 113 48 42 80 26 164 73 180 6	She needs more sun.
6	33 214 174 47 108 93 165 133 183 206 6	Are you bale to see anything,i don't?
6	202 116 210 100 129 58 20 51 158 193 6	That looks sooo modern.
6	19 90 174 194 65 36 73 165 55 138 6	No light in this house
6	185 81 198 23 125 71 88 97 87 8 6	He looks like a monster wolf.
6	109 175 11 76 60 23 199 171 64 182 6	Wow, spotless. No rust there at all.
6	137 131 53 15 9 74 7 91 14 21 6	Could you have at least given the girl a bigger pumpkin to carve!
6	55 146 45 96 170 111 9 137 190 196 6	Wow I have to climb like 3 steps nice this won't hurt my legs at all.
6	78 91 156 37 176 34 177 61 97 135 6	No one needs that many bags.  Well maybe if his girlfriend just kicked him to the curb.
6	96 150 63 52 62 80 16 161 153 110 6	She must have the Hope Diamond.
6	182 87 208 76 4 210 10 106 137 23 6	Wow I can really see so much.
6	193 63 164 55 59 144 48 22 109 172 6	This looks a fun spot to swim.
6	9 151 36 213 183 64 50 188 80 105 6	He looks so cold in that.
6	148 75 199 211 169 78 97 118 131 198 6	Does he think that that jacket looks good on him? Man, what a genius.
6	50 99 19 121 183 177 57 200 9 179 6	They look like amazing athletes...
6	57 130 135 187 22 156 148 114 149 144 6	Those coats aren't bright enough. NOT.
6	16 172 121 192 23 56 99 27 37 188 6	And that, folks, is what happens when you eat too many marshmallows
6	88 106 182 64 175 115 63 197 2 11 6	Wave that flag!
6	213 20 168 167 130 71 158 186 31 133 6	It's a shame that a 1st grader designed that bridge.
6	152 52 87 171 28 84 125 10 50 75 6	Elat Earthers what now ?
6	166 113 124 212 181 144 133 109 116 86 6	It's raining cats and dogs!
6	8 28 35 77 211 4 63 154 139 130 6	Dogs will be dogs...not babies.  This woman has the dog in the stroller. Gheez!
6	99 82 119 182 124 67 19 88 57 42 6	short shorts and boots! please
6	191 161 88 158 130 102 91 36 89 128 6	Result a picture of nothing
6	167 207 107 44 169 40 179 74 211 166 6	Why did you but that
6	140 148 107 57 136 1 115 38 112 195 6	Oh yeah, sure. Point up. They totally care.
6	93 120 166 81 10 146 35 16 168 70 6	Oh look, two dogs staring into space.  How interesting.
6	83 95 8 84 124 72 36 11 26 2 6	That one white uniform player is really gonna stand a chance against those three other players.
6	55 205 112 151 43 211 192 159 195 170 6	Could this picture be more zoomed out on the subjects?
6	59 8 34 152 103 171 108 20 191 74 6	Running of the rhinos or running of the idiots.
6	101 9 143 57 98 10 61 144 166 171 6	This s like a corn maze, but with statues.
6	204 151 49 28 184 27 77 41 124 139 6	That dude's not loving that moment! Not at all.
6	129 201 38 153 39 7 64 137 130 75 6	This chair is either covered in snow or the snow is covered in the chair.
6	108 168 182 118 35 75 159 209 8 74 6	Sure, I'd LOVE for you poke me in the eye, it would feel great!
6	123 155 204 175 157 108 29 205 101 24 6	King Penguin would be better than King Cheeto that we've got now.
6	110 179 2 210 204 1 113 86 21 39 6	Bet that little spider is going to wish he wasn't a male in about five minutes.
6	37 174 181 137 10 88 4 185 97 183 6	Oh, yes, we're just SO hip, sitting here watching people go by!
6	191 46 201 109 4 42 130 70 185 155 6	This is a brand new car.
6	163 150 22 44 113 110 155 123 189 111 6	Powerlines in front of a sunset? Seriously? Tacky.
6	175 188 158 13 3 15 156 167 116 88 6	This car will fly away.
6	99 171 136 61 37 71 180 143 32 114 6	He just lost the lottery.
6	108 121 46 117 112 181 34 32 50 87 6	What a happy looking family!
6	200 158 11 91 62 47 65 153 31 147 6	That creature doesn't look gross at all and I can definitely tell what it is.
6	180 110 167 11 122 214 161 100 54 144 6	Nice little pool they have got there.
6	127 123 86 124 11 163 47 152 162 144 6	The crowd is too big.
6	34 49 208 114 212 180 205 111 185 2 6	Well that seems like a safe idea.
6	163 174 91 179 102 76 7 77 187 197 6	Is that baby drinking milk or acting fake?
6	125 83 73 85 106 19 115 207 49 32 6	I always love going on the bus, it's so clean and wonderful...
6	169 103 177 75 147 131 203 102 70 154 6	Kid:  Hey mom, look at me on the slide...Mom:  Hold up, I'm busy staring at the sky.
6	158 23 81 162 114 151 181 155 55 44 6	What is that a baby banana
6	159 203 76 47 178 204 39 175 188 14 6	If you're reading this sign, it's already too late.
6	151 177 96 164 188 78 26 40 195 4 6	white flowers.. i bet they dont deserve the colour.. infact , much better ones
6	124 119 171 156 50 41 35 118 68 157 6	Look at all the missiles exploding in the air.
6	161 156 68 139 63 39 162 153 133 141 6	Well I bet this is tasty even if it does look like puke.
6	166 91 16 57 79 28 181 209 135 109 6	Looks like this person's lost.
6	79 64 174 125 170 43 32 202 109 164 6	William Wallace was such a great man he got a plaque.  NOT.
6	63 140 164 205 8 195 144 198 103 112 6	Little yellow food, I mean fish.
6	118 129 156 4 193 139 120 59 15 54 6	Nice short-shorts, dude.
6	137 99 13 34 119 213 12 160 52 143 6	This looks like a big race.  A race for the loser of the other big race.
6	41 31 76 135 78 57 9 34 55 23 6	Nice hair buddy....
6	138 119 213 111 144 92 123 78 34 143 6	Wonderful picture. I'm green with envy...
6	29 112 148 68 91 66 154 74 18 43 6	I wonder how one can place such smiling male faces alongside gorgeous damsels in the same photo.
6	32 135 133 35 136 4 44 197 1 175 6	I hope he doesn't get bit...
6	24 196 85 66 197 180 157 93 184 122 6	Hey buddy, you got something on your face.
6	125 63 146 54 4 172 212 126 9 198 6	Oh yeah, life is all fun and games.
6	111 165 92 35 4 27 116 68 131 53 6	Ooooooohhhh...another "pretty" sunset. Yaaaawn...
6	115 188 130 33 125 171 209 162 108 73 6	This rigged up swing looks like something a 10 year old put together.
6	48 209 53 29 174 12 82 41 145 1 6	That's right dude, stare down her ex and remind her of what she lost, you know they guy with sponsors.
6	120 57 214 170 100 142 132 160 2 145 6	coffee? or beer :P
6	129 205 173 27 92 156 96 44 102 123 6	As if anyone actually follows arrows painted on the street anymore.
7	127 83 183 90 175 113 92 42 147 63 7	A perfect house has a perfect garden.
7	13 194 97 53 72 12 44 86 198 135 7	My life is like a train track.
7	43 166 183 57 101 151 180 185 105 148 7	Oh wow these are so special and pretty!
7	141 10 212 88 174 155 44 132 198 67 7	Nobody has ever heard of this guy.
7	212 61 98 204 170 105 185 55 26 17 7	Nice gate, I guess.
7	167 112 9 62 169 37 198 105 76 109 7	I like these fancy pillars much more than trees and cliffs.
7	185 79 32 121 169 168 61 2 194 137 7	This picture is made up
7	136 198 191 88 143 114 69 174 154 74 7	wow I've totally been here
7	111 112 178 200 79 38 49 117 37 113 7	really looks like so much fun with those hot sweaty people. yay crowds!
7	55 36 15 138 92 107 204 95 133 10 7	This is great perspective!
7	134 196 23 192 30 113 53 195 173 51 7	The flower is not real
7	24 213 83 171 35 166 158 82 69 70 7	This girls tan and hair are to die for, where can I buy this too
7	86 10 199 91 203 133 103 157 105 94 7	That pot is too old to function anymore. Replace it.
7	112 167 208 63 22 4 68 125 173 39 7	bartle doo gay
7	125 114 68 32 120 14 200 162 121 40 7	This man looks pasted in.
7	178 191 78 26 143 213 29 212 101 77 7	That green paint does not belong in a natural setting.
7	183 121 194 124 176 180 85 140 190 65 7	It is a baby sleeping. I don't see what the need for a picture is.
7	126 83 78 139 138 154 152 127 132 167 7	This show was really really great! SUper job!
7	191 89 177 207 109 37 137 206 30 131 7	They use faux stone instead of real stone.
7	13 151 44 39 186 60 27 124 159 96 7	The view is not real
7	61 14 152 49 35 195 178 206 119 205 7	This photo is clearly staged.
7	67 152 15 155 150 127 5 205 119 196 7	What a dreary day
7	53 162 116 50 100 30 83 11 33 14 7	Gray images with just a tinge of color such as the picture of the girl by the pool look unnatural.
7	189 57 171 134 169 213 155 194 146 54 7	urm yeeeah that a nice car
7	91 86 192 66 115 59 14 130 190 23 7	Rest in peace to this war hero.  You will be missed.
7	166 185 20 54 173 176 113 175 59 50 7	This park is amazing! I recommend it.
7	194 84 38 209 55 26 114 154 170 153 7	These fish are so so unique!
7	55 183 177 187 164 123 90 110 119 95 7	The ball is in the air. The boy will catch the ball.
7	100 6 185 81 47 83 202 70 28 112 7	The children cross the bridge over the field
7	165 202 66 143 114 129 96 195 35 116 7	This is a pretty good picture.
7	1 25 193 167 107 76 147 202 155 134 7	I see this picture here which looks very beautiful but I think it's photoshopped cause it's too perfect.
7	29 136 74 159 51 13 4 132 191 200 7	What a cutie pie!!!!!!
7	27 121 52 122 173 40 167 56 133 142 7	The plane is fake
7	23 134 31 197 58 99 82 24 123 52 7	Oh what a lovely market!
7	134 78 100 146 104 64 22 210 54 206 7	He's not a real monkey!
7	75 79 198 128 31 24 140 19 4 155 7	I rarely drink instant coffee, I much prefer cold-press.
7	203 20 186 187 128 143 197 181 169 97 7	Man, I'd love to hear that baby purr.
7	5 50 31 14 73 117 206 20 138 128 7	Oh that bottle of liquor looks so tasty.
7	10 173 191 133 194 144 102 135 198 20 7	As you can see, my sister-in-law lives in an ordinary neighborhood unlike my gated community.
7	53 69 9 110 100 49 158 20 46 188 7	This is very clear and easy to understand.
7	93 137 193 160 49 127 188 55 174 95 7	Lots of rocks in the sand. Probably a terrible beach to lounge at.
7	65 34 174 168 88 27 64 62 147 18 7	The plant is not real
7	170 197 15 25 76 153 146 206 167 9 7	Two doors, one larger than the other. The second one is a double door, for opening larger. Maybe during a large gathering.
7	45 90 22 13 9 174 85 165 154 54 7	Oh this looks like fun.
7	213 167 208 66 207 168 49 104 179 119 7	Ok. When I first saw this , I swore this guy was a wax figure at a museum. Look how flawless his skin looks. lol. Too funny.
7	99 37 163 6 47 41 49 121 122 4 7	The flowers can be seen
7	176 152 14 48 98 182 165 179 75 52 7	Oh, isn't that just a lovely fan!  I must see where I can get one of those!
7	206 182 215 17 100 101 210 145 112 161 7	not a natural green
7	136 8 31 205 156 129 64 160 65 123 7	The view can be seen
7	211 11 215 137 42 82 176 141 178 188 7	The view is nice
7	212 100 154 30 83 60 121 136 168 75 7	The poster looks real to me
7	121 15 163 118 43 200 197 95 175 152 7	New media vans parked on street for unknown reason
7	150 75 82 98 51 199 196 126 116 57 7	World is filled with man made things!
7	71 106 101 46 44 161 99 97 169 9 7	This picture is very pleasing
7	32 151 135 134 136 103 183 208 39 111 7	Nice yellow jacket you've got there. No, I mean it, it totally isn't tacky. It looks great on you, banana face.
7	34 58 203 144 185 14 197 193 71 190 7	This photo is too grainy, who cares.
7	48 190 145 9 45 85 193 211 118 124 7	There is so much imitation of life in this.
7	86 46 125 127 32 119 148 191 95 184 7	Such a greaaat picture. lol
7	121 90 78 69 106 185 203 204 190 139 7	Awww wow what pretty artwork! haha
7	33 134 130 116 174 10 57 188 108 146 7	The leaves are brown.
7	63 5 138 123 146 62 16 61 67 37 7	THIS BABY IS LOOKING  VERY BEAUTY FUL
7	44 86 109 200 139 125 129 140 19 62 7	Bright lights, steel and machinery represent our society.
7	35 92 64 87 76 135 156 130 179 120 7	Only caring people will smile infront of others with a genuine amount of eye contact. Artificial people wont
7	82 89 23 106 3 189 120 128 67 193 7	This is such a shiny rock formation.
7	175 138 184 60 137 124 164 170 169 147 7	What a fake walking area.
7	46 166 183 43 169 96 88 139 212 173 7	I really like how the lighting makes the shadows appear two different colors.
7	81 89 16 204 157 164 214 179 14 49 7	some people just show off by wearing helmets on two wheelers and riding bikes to impress others but it is not always the case
7	10 99 15 72 93 56 150 125 100 35 7	I'm so outdoorsy. That's where this is, right? Outdoors?
7	64 126 156 177 123 203 4 201 213 144 7	Looks like a doll
7	70 128 172 5 215 55 173 22 167 88 7	The stairs are actually made of plasitc
7	204 67 137 195 48 184 215 86 79 88 7	I want to see the hockey players score a touchdown.
7	27 28 168 174 71 66 177 8 181 165 7	i can come and help. If i had a car
7	137 156 13 93 21 71 35 108 114 168 7	The Empire State Building is a marvel of concrete and steel
7	86 23 145 177 137 129 195 13 186 183 7	This place looks cheap.
7	77 22 143 4 54 133 189 28 130 2 7	Oh my goodness, this is so great!
7	204 50 127 68 173 165 186 40 60 92 7	looks ok to me
7	132 44 79 62 118 131 75 13 96 169 7	They should make those graves a prettier color.
7	213 57 109 194 197 17 187 11 48 168 7	I have no idea about the game of hockey but I came because I got these tickets for free.
7	44 37 43 24 107 180 93 42 12 150 7	Wow, so awesome to look at.
7	33 183 201 149 18 52 110 10 130 99 7	Oh, so cool to have one of these in our town.
7	137 96 68 173 164 115 85 88 139 101 7	She should be a model, great future ahead of her.
7	151 171 183 73 115 162 132 6 53 141 7	Designate "child" seems to be preparing to throw an object.  Recommend seeking shelter or taking said object away from his grasp.
7	192 56 213 109 122 23 74 10 191 22 7	She should wear a prettier jacket.
7	141 43 150 130 30 23 187 86 51 111 7	They're probably just out for a stroll.
7	50 10 15 73 158 192 76 114 84 108 7	These people look so boring
7	132 179 113 180 95 203 106 102 124 145 7	Two women standing near each other.
7	165 106 74 212 137 156 185 127 206 205 7	Anchors need to rest somewhere in the sea, not the rocky pavements.
7	28 179 185 137 99 30 59 138 117 68 7	A bridge is hanging.
7	140 43 98 197 97 21 25 174 49 149 7	His smile is not nature
7	167 138 181 63 106 126 35 202 136 100 7	That's a great looking fake owl.
7	12 15 118 2 164 87 124 20 106 104 7	Fancy breeds of dogs are real dogs.
7	98 69 6 9 43 206 4 81 138 36 7	I can make a float ten times better, wait and see.
7	121 193 65 114 130 33 152 168 13 56 7	I'd really like to visit this wonderful place
7	140 200 40 141 181 176 46 27 184 179 7	Wow.  A beach.
7	17 24 213 21 138 128 191 168 123 97 7	These robots are not very good.
7	21 39 76 127 16 68 107 60 152 175 7	Airlines aren't viable businesses anymore.
7	79 212 106 50 63 103 177 52 34 1 7	I think people are all just doing a mental dance, nobody has real conversations
7	65 32 188 146 24 157 81 84 205 34 7	This looks more like a movie than real life.
7	167 62 68 197 118 128 212 172 37 4 7	This water is so great to use as a mirror for doing makeup!
7	19 76 155 20 172 36 173 90 134 106 7	Those chairs and not the original ones the table came with.
7	210 63 40 127 167 162 147 89 193 119 7	THAT FAMILY LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE NOT RELATED
7	9 142 34 212 42 159 50 57 130 180 7	This looks like a fancy building.
7	39 204 87 151 108 103 22 181 89 60 7	Pam, your hair is looking extra tall today!
7	109 26 15 176 197 49 62 54 101 61 7	This looks like it is new.
7	213 73 185 145 21 97 111 134 68 35 7	The tunnel looks fake
7	124 178 204 60 12 94 97 67 68 14 7	Sometimes you can't fake interest.
7	33 157 145 142 169 68 200 50 147 45 7	This road is too congested.
7	98 56 180 118 39 88 111 70 81 116 7	The banks of every river are clean and attractive as they are maintained by humans.
7	204 201 153 12 155 105 200 49 117 213 7	This appears to be a gathering of humans for the purpose of entertainment.
7	9 96 86 183 209 172 29 177 58 41 7	This place would be brighter with more lighting.
7	78 134 4 182 148 87 90 82 67 33 7	Sir, I do not think they wish to play patty cake with you.
7	146 35 80 39 116 174 1 61 199 134 7	This looks very plain to me.
7	176 118 103 61 69 193 32 159 125 132 7	Those plants are just THE most beautiful thing I have, like, ever seen! Evah!
7	19 202 26 138 94 159 167 84 201 15 7	This scene reminds me of the 17th century.
7	143 183 138 35 46 36 72 130 203 115 7	I think that boat looks fake and doesn't work.
7	22 79 59 28 8 139 39 50 148 34 7	This picture is so washed out it doesn't even look real.
7	126 170 29 172 148 75 149 100 120 117 7	This looks like fake paint.
7	106 166 59 156 147 171 149 31 20 14 7	A lovely exhibit for man made material.
7	48 51 118 31 200 52 159 92 195 101 7	Where are the pretty colors in this city?
7	201 169 35 80 126 159 183 78 45 147 7	These rocks form a wall of fear.
7	21 55 58 19 214 37 122 213 158 40 7	A baby is cute.
7	149 97 17 211 84 150 44 71 53 9 7	I can't stand the sun.
7	194 143 149 50 156 152 101 76 61 199 7	I could play that better than him
7	88 146 28 102 195 11 105 35 150 43 7	Cant wait for the next suare
7	133 150 146 56 68 134 19 163 131 157 7	Aww that dog looks so sad, I really really do care for it even if it sounds like I don't...
7	26 30 126 166 198 66 181 41 13 129 7	Is this guy a robot?
7	28 121 1 40 124 134 145 5 214 179 7	Great sign there!
7	77 69 189 101 22 109 162 149 84 166 7	Flying birds are flying.
7	73 14 57 17 103 200 12 151 176 113 7	A red and white flag on the beach.
7	214 135 80 99 46 179 191 100 33 197 7	He seems to be get tired.
7	195 150 99 85 191 169 27 165 126 203 7	What does this even mean?
7	51 127 21 142 26 109 159 72 89 199 7	Such a bland building.
7	93 159 71 53 31 177 161 126 28 30 7	I have those exact lights in my mansion
7	53 177 170 160 44 27 130 116 40 61 7	Doggo, here. Woof.
7	9 161 2 85 187 153 128 41 171 106 7	I could do this
7	114 168 45 128 196 75 192 61 156 57 7	Looks photoshopped to me
7	126 153 186 86 93 85 83 211 183 103 7	Are these flowers?
7	99 185 90 19 124 78 181 127 104 188 7	The paint on the slide seems to be flaking off some.
7	165 146 23 4 98 120 203 58 192 177 7	That has to be the ugliest statue I have ever seen.
7	182 157 35 36 152 5 98 85 57 16 7	Nice job rider.
7	86 146 82 10 41 46 185 191 102 142 7	This deep blue well above, with these white webs of miraculous beauty. I shall like to gaze upon it for I'm not certain of it's mysterious sight
7	204 3 157 91 154 30 66 79 9 126 7	Translating. Error.  Language unrecognized.
7	181 175 85 22 214 71 39 30 51 47 7	This is definitely something I do all the time
7	187 56 37 179 105 69 150 146 103 138 7	All land like this will be industrialized.
7	76 215 33 153 143 212 39 22 104 214 7	This photo is GREAAAT. So lively, and beautiful to look at.
7	168 211 199 66 121 103 173 187 170 25 7	I think she needs a total makeover.
7	14 174 118 158 6 54 138 67 47 211 7	This is SO great! It makes me want to get up and dance. . . .
7	102 162 83 145 90 13 183 197 167 33 7	Bird, fly bird fly.
7	107 166 106 209 21 102 184 137 37 98 7	This site needs some life. Some buildings should make it more attractive.
7	152 162 96 19 131 117 108 165 148 101 7	The building magically disappeared into the fog and/or clouds.
7	184 27 212 123 174 156 18 171 4 98 7	Two kids doing work.
7	168 21 110 169 108 146 194 63 121 18 7	A human standing on the floor it seems.
7	108 42 158 59 36 62 11 61 55 168 7	This looks like a great place to take a selfie.  It would make me look very outdoorsy.
7	80 5 22 120 159 16 64 178 186 20 7	I really love to be in an enclosed space much like the people in the photograph, I mean who needs the wide open spaces.
7	165 205 88 39 75 164 176 148 136 20 7	I don't think he's as drunk as he's letting on.
7	17 119 11 135 184 3 212 56 44 132 7	Designate "human" is holding a bag of plastic filled with balls of latex.

7	14 156 143 9 181 182 94 89 51 38 7	He's so fast! (I hope he falls)
7	117 179 180 161 22 24 184 87 200 42 7	the leaves look so saturated they could be fake
7	82 215 74 132 89 198 189 12 180 1 7	I LOVE his tee-shirt!
7	65 63 42 22 186 36 9 210 194 212 7	What are they wearing?
7	35 210 159 203 77 93 56 189 161 167 7	I think I see strawberries
7	126 75 79 53 3 55 197 102 88 38 7	This is a man with a blue table.
7	111 48 36 26 119 46 121 167 173 122 7	Fun land, we become kids all over again
7	5 67 144 24 112 72 215 110 156 92 7	This ship is the ship from Gilligan's Island, like, for real.
7	141 119 22 11 135 57 50 159 42 67 7	Men are better at cooking than robots and machines.
7	13 177 120 116 30 69 99 42 193 130 7	You should go there dear, it's so you.
7	176 54 6 71 77 191 201 33 152 168 7	Robot camera mode, activated.
7	212 116 130 211 84 18 162 70 196 119 7	they're secretly all lip singing
7	66 108 38 72 91 31 113 150 112 146 7	Thats not real its a fake
7	17 71 58 171 201 55 154 150 94 198 7	Is grain stored in that silo?
7	42 214 137 88 76 172 204 52 142 202 7	What an organized and captivation scene.
7	33 192 126 86 15 103 136 115 165 186 7	She looks happy, really!
7	21 167 56 134 4 121 113 209 190 43 7	I eat star fish in my dreams
7	15 33 11 93 82 76 149 206 171 26 7	This looks like a man made substance.
7	166 60 75 97 185 164 44 138 4 3 7	Is that a dumpy school or what?
7	201 157 6 104 126 171 190 136 85 114 7	This was made with a panorama app.
7	87 173 9 13 10 155 27 98 157 17 7	This photo is very poorly made.
7	42 103 25 88 136 71 134 139 52 148 7	Surrounded by faceless people.
7	168 214 101 147 37 106 6 28 9 185 7	Remember the fun summers we would have? It looks like we could have some fun with this!
7	213 69 66 132 52 200 214 207 90 149 7	What are all these fools listening to?
7	175 47 83 130 8 69 111 104 98 20 7	What a pretty boat!
7	80 82 75 70 53 136 15 180 106 78 7	This is the most phony looking audience of deckchair vacationers I've ever seen.
7	81 201 203 104 147 158 52 100 39 43 7	This is exactly how I look.
7	195 59 64 82 19 96 147 35 165 58 7	What a marvelously delightful setting, quite fetching
7	105 79 179 97 126 33 178 26 8 114 7	THis plane is made of plastic.
7	195 167 51 127 185 101 39 73 11 89 7	Oh what a cool picture!! Thanks for sharing! :)
8	19 87 161 91 136 109 101 24 194 26 8	What interesting pice of art work.
8	205 80 192 105 56 109 45 54 123 15 8	What a nice boat ride, they're enjoying themselves.
8	190 111 163 150 47 41 205 45 66 200 8	The way exposed Ice chills a beer, and sets the scene for relaxed times with many friends, is not to be underestimated.
8	44 215 97 152 34 161 177 181 169 145 8	This must be some sort of art to distinguish the many different culture's we have in this world.
8	172 18 60 178 186 108 64 170 168 160 8	When people come together like this, we are reminded of the most important lesson in life: Happiness is only real when shared.
8	21 86 87 37 204 114 188 165 179 150 8	The man is well spoken
8	20 91 210 15 177 110 3 128 211 32 8	The most beautiful site in California.
8	25 92 191 154 82 167 44 114 58 122 8	this camera is eloquent
8	54 140 30 196 55 172 35 120 138 58 8	This reminds me of the homes and families I saw on my trip to Haiti. What an emotionally draining day that was.
8	127 34 119 15 2 160 76 202 5 60 8	It was stated that the building represented the era of the impressionist.
8	107 23 171 207 88 215 98 210 122 172 8	why only one lady on the team
8	165 82 134 43 44 95 156 102 57 113 8	The font used on that sign reminds me of Jazz and I can hear the sounds of the saxophone wafting through the air.
8	186 154 180 41 202 6 215 205 167 196 8	Very nice perspective here.
8	12 144 83 113 57 189 39 201 51 75 8	Wow, this photo is wonderfully captured.
8	32 131 105 90 192 80 162 50 128 1 8	The beautiful instrument beheld here would be able to create such resonating sounds.
8	93 31 83 69 114 201 1 176 198 95 8	I think this photo was a mistake.
8	112 110 136 67 189 80 210 124 17 133 8	A photographer who can capture nature is a true artist.
8	152 141 96 34 160 99 79 63 27 38 8	The phrase "youth is wasted on the young" becomes more true to me the older I get.
8	134 76 57 204 141 87 201 19 50 113 8	What a lovely light green.
8	169 22 200 117 20 202 140 10 45 29 8	We can never build anything as beautiful as the trees.
8	3 195 57 197 72 86 182 88 59 108 8	I would hate to get stuck in there
8	35 7 145 148 89 83 38 20 57 75 8	The town of Swallow Falls has never seen a more glorious self-portrait. How outstanding to have you representing their interests!
8	47 1 79 114 210 185 49 80 39 84 8	This reminds me of the Alamo. I love the Spanish Architecture.
8	35 51 18 138 113 152 201 11 136 202 8	What a perfect composition, negative space is two quadrants and strong images in the other two.
8	90 7 31 64 43 65 149 17 70 50 8	Only on social media would such an irrelevant photo of nothing make it's appearance in my newsfeed.
8	56 50 192 205 38 16 98 153 1 115 8	There is power in her stance and readiness in her eyes.

8	143 144 78 210 9 69 196 153 104 189 8	We should respect the traditions our ancestors set forth.
8	64 40 211 54 45 10 160 110 199 162 8	This young gentleman has confidence as he steps up to the plate. You can see the focus on his face as he watches the ball. You can feel his excitement as the ball comes towards him and he swings with grace.
8	10 192 112 18 60 51 91 186 208 14 8	The desert. Inhospitable, yet filled with vibrant life in unexpected corners.
8	155 14 196 93 106 119 64 174 44 78 8	This old engine looks to be of an 1800s vintage, quite lovely detailing in the metalwork.
8	214 169 160 163 204 113 213 198 84 70 8	Good people enjoying themselves, and at such a lovely place.
8	17 51 95 2 97 109 25 43 188 5 8	The man seems expressive
8	195 43 5 37 31 81 18 13 99 181 8	The waterfall is quite beautiful, a true marvel of this earth's design.
8	63 156 194 140 85 130 78 1 11 196 8	They can do as they please I'll just stand right here and be myself.
8	68 196 2 186 142 105 114 36 63 191 8	Fascinating angle of shot here.
8	76 16 178 43 145 96 88 65 103 144 8	This babe is quite impressed with themselves.

9	187 153 5 166 72 111 1 107 157 8 9	With my first big check, I plan on taking care of my family.
9	26 159 147 154 151 176 155 170 103 132 9	I hope he doesn't drown.

9	3 154 160 36 128 63 135 17 159 27 9	The family that owns this store deserves all the praise they get.
9	195 177 59 141 60 41 84 7 38 109 9	Someone is going to get hurt by that tree.
9	91 194 185 173 8 46 195 147 108 215 9	I hope they take him to a vet.
9	82 115 81 175 118 29 167 143 31 8 9	Such a lovely sky.

9	128 56 98 169 181 124 83 67 186 154 9	These giant creatures are a part of history so I'm glad they are preserved and displayed for our education
9	50 65 96 91 131 160 55 48 99 69 9	That's a really rough sport... I hope they don't get hurt
9	157 209 163 116 159 16 78 184 111 137 9	You can just see the love in the smile on her face.
9	58 85 152 28 108 109 57 112 45 1 9	I will catch you if you fall, I'll be right there whenever you need me.
9	110 206 108 54 77 2 14 25 17 109 9	I hope he's watching his carb count and staying healthy!
9	12 143 165 14 86 185 125 152 11 22 9	I hope that whoever took this picture is eating enough.  His hands seems mighty shaky I hope hes not malnourished

11	156 173 46 19 70 146 31 126 65 69 11	This is just a plain old pig.
11	71 81 203 51 98 126 200 181 107 117 11	Just a lot of brush.
11	68 202 101 179 163 206 152 52 125 148 11	Sounds like a great day to drive a tractor.
11	53 112 164 199 168 131 207 161 208 205 11	This beach is nothing special.
11	133 93 5 156 145 160 166 65 79 120 11	I close my eyes when I touch heads
11	207 66 28 171 202 27 143 212 18 5 11	Wait, what's happening here?
11	60 6 160 121 69 208 5 101 42 119 11	Look like an interesting race.
11	35 82 174 78 169 148 157 81 90 205 11	What a typical office setting, popcorn looks good.
11	158 93 100 109 139 92 184 128 45 2 11	That is a nice view of the city.
11	22 97 133 50 130 201 155 70 174 185 11	These are young children.
11	131 157 178 98 210 74 215 33 154 170 11	This is wall with some art on it.
11	38 101 195 67 106 16 207 108 135 107 11	Does a bear poop in the woods?
11	187 121 114 214 42 74 162 213 19 120 11	That looks like a tiger face mixed with a human face
11	70 143 60 206 15 202 167 132 205 88 11	Exactly the typical cathedral hallway in Europe.
11	136 168 76 173 126 135 142 74 36 160 11	Look at this, it is a small elephant.
11	201 76 157 199 91 182 62 191 193 34 11	This is definitely a body of water.
11	182 61 76 203 112 55 177 40 83 53 11	Another day rowing on the lake.
11	17 150 56 131 171 6 155 111 153 57 11	Looks like y'all are having a great night
11	71 197 204 173 32 158 62 180 63 24 11	Is this a back alley?
11	114 192 71 46 164 74 178 111 184 211 11	It's a perfectly decent hallway.
11	149 134 64 22 201 129 140 152 53 83 11	That look fairly interesting.
11	161 33 6 115 21 186 3 138 133 204 11	A picture taken at a farm.
11	98 109 211 154 44 60 47 162 203 89 11	Balloon tricks never get old - even for adults.
11	139 82 114 49 213 160 199 147 18 173 11	Just some lady taking a picture of someone taking a picture.
11	31 105 191 150 126 169 10 125 129 29 11	Pictures of people running probably aren't the best for making a clear picture
11	144 215 122 123 138 100 98 150 40 30 11	Stock photo of a stock rapper
11	64 189 45 135 198 67 81 215 191 192 11	This is a neat view.
11	36 2 106 162 75 14 34 181 16 136 11	Nice old car!
11	66 72 111 73 196 190 170 116 184 100 11	The woman on the left forgot to dress for the occasion.
11	62 66 111 29 59 140 127 122 161 12 11	OH I SO NEED A DRINK
11	25 14 80 183 131 69 89 65 59 10 11	NICE GREEN COLOR
11	32 58 212 45 154 54 114 43 56 119 11	The lion will have the duck for dinner.
11	102 85 73 17 200 178 119 147 82 212 11	This looks edited.
11	109 123 10 166 64 24 72 207 168 16 11	They are dressed okay.
11	10 61 5 131 175 130 55 34 188 52 11	looks like a good time
11	28 62 73 150 40 110 115 178 94 125 11	That's a pretty woman on the sign. Wonder what its advertising?
11	183 189 212 201 21 27 35 113 100 130 11	I've always wanted to try offroading one day.
11	83 121 177 141 136 162 51 203 167 123 11	That's a huge crowd of people.
11	192 101 66 17 174 151 159 103 212 141 11	Just a lazy day for the animals.
11	154 201 213 102 163 200 215 96 73 1 11	It looks like a tense game.
11	71 20 54 94 185 17 112 210 55 145 11	I'm pretty sure this is from Korea or China.
11	99 30 165 180 147 32 68 208 109 56 11	I hope my team wins!
11	212 39 56 98 195 5 18 146 109 13 11	That's a big, strange bird.
11	55 165 128 196 104 18 210 117 105 84 11	Those are some pretty wild flowers.
11	155 48 170 171 180 73 203 213 201 30 11	That looks like a toy dropped in the back yard.
11	90 46 24 107 91 163 113 186 134 47 11	This is just a typical run down area of town.
11	191 174 128 94 151 169 184 52 47 43 11	I wonder what KMA stands for.
11	26 120 111 173 83 136 102 56 2 110 11	Nice sunset. I've seen many though.
11	183 6 199 159 19 105 12 168 63 28 11	It's always a good time to celebrate the Season!
11	106 44 43 163 89 67 172 22 154 75 11	That sure is an old car.
11	75 137 116 70 23 120 187 49 136 73 11	Just a normal beach.
11	83 151 176 36 98 52 174 64 12 180 11	Oh no not again
11	95 128 185 50 78 135 67 94 204 161 11	Just your typical European scene.
11	142 24 63 183 189 85 39 64 150 83 11	That is a horse jumping.
11	61 105 135 169 156 14 69 184 180 16 11	Those plains look like birds.
11	108 15 160 184 68 84 18 50 129 25 11	What a boring ancient document.
11	151 168 82 101 73 190 3 121 128 186 11	What a nice shot.  I really like those pants.
11	74 25 36 88 104 188 135 3 211 201 11	I really like the look of his metal chain.
11	64 35 214 102 85 53 131 119 154 199 11	I would love to ride a horse through the countryside.
11	44 179 211 158 109 157 156 150 80 175 11	It was a really great family get together getting to see everyone.
11	136 194 109 5 204 31 111 114 143 165 11	I like this picture a lot.
11	62 92 176 19 17 96 156 49 91 74 11	That's cool. I like the congruity.
11	54 142 157 186 169 60 52 112 173 136 11	I think he is winning the bike race
11	195 191 189 2 42 68 143 66 171 80 11	I've seen this pattern before. It's been used quite a lot.
11	24 135 99 160 69 146 84 138 27 42 11	Beautiful city night hindered by pollution
11	53 183 115 206 155 143 111 4 173 209 11	Nice place for a wedding
11	39 98 60 52 30 22 121 65 193 110 11	It looks like an airplane with a tree in the background.
11	156 10 148 172 21 184 18 71 96 83 11	An instant picture.
11	41 80 191 59 183 44 178 61 148 69 11	The children just love that swing.  Look at that line!
11	114 210 154 21 79 133 161 189 32 142 11	She is a singer.
11	115 208 37 91 137 27 94 184 72 56 11	Somebody's ready to make a toast.
11	104 134 184 45 79 111 65 50 54 182 11	That's a pretty piece of art.
11	30 51 38 214 131 106 5 186 156 212 11	What is that? Are those numbers?
11	144 142 99 104 109 156 159 33 29 113 11	What is it? Is it metal?
11	125 156 104 10 155 175 102 110 181 2 11	What a lovely scenery, maybe the set of a movie.
11	4 57 209 121 9 39 94 199 129 13 11	I feel that this is a normal scene.
11	66 126 59 198 93 84 117 83 32 147 11	Nice apartments, good neighborhood
11	8 168 125 170 24 160 69 57 112 153 11	I couldn't wear a shirt like that. It would be way out of character for me.
11	86 175 122 142 188 111 191 69 158 45 11	I like this picture of you at the gas station.
11	197 94 139 150 58 67 92 130 152 109 11	Another random group of people protesting something they probably know nothing about.
11	169 62 24 39 135 42 145 125 130 109 11	This flower is quite nice, I have seen better I have seen worse, a very average flower.
11	151 117 169 71 124 37 207 87 35 138 11	Another place to go and sit on a roack.
11	28 67 167 10 59 189 155 44 142 211 11	Why don't they include all the letters of the alphabet?
11	215 89 2 168 84 131 62 71 36 102 11	a good night out with friends
11	150 74 110 55 128 120 32 177 53 174 11	As a child I would have climbed that tree.
11	76 7 146 185 197 35 124 67 66 175 11	Nice paint job.
11	172 55 209 112 100 76 12 3 141 150 11	Nice picture of this scene from life.
11	145 151 135 155 33 215 133 100 127 32 11	Just a normal day, out for a normal drive, in a normal neighborhood.
11	215 33 129 3 125 109 79 171 148 118 11	It is my everyday routine to come and overlook my notes in the books.
11	1 151 8 78 85 143 213 98 33 192 11	Another boy playing the guitar.
11	95 52 153 62 196 107 9 112 211 87 11	This is just an average drawing.
11	185 98 64 197 141 189 198 72 37 159 11	Is that a rock or a snack?
11	44 26 7 20 28 23 15 104 13 135 11	This room looks like my grandmas.
11	168 117 204 209 38 2 80 55 77 31 11	This is so blue
11	10 20 98 198 19 210 37 106 73 158 11	This bird has a long beak.
11	134 87 52 178 94 156 32 33 31 113 11	Pretty nice drawing, I'd say.
11	147 82 182 37 124 97 155 83 102 179 11	It's a cute bird.
11	200 150 210 171 143 79 1 181 63 155 11	this looks ok i guess.
11	93 20 14 148 27 162 19 73 99 108 11	the green is nothing to explain
11	139 168 100 123 190 196 13 210 69 176 11	This picture does not make me feel anything in particular.
11	13 50 62 115 162 47 155 33 203 70 11	Well this is just another normal sight for us.
11	194 179 80 14 94 9 112 4 97 22 11	Those are some cool piece of swimwear.
11	1 136 211 180 10 95 56 178 9 185 11	It's a close up of a plane engine.
11	7 100 210 65 15 9 150 117 71 68 11	Another day, another generic castle.
11	188 24 204 143 26 203 63 200 116 211 11	She looks like a nice rocker.
11	141 167 18 22 26 104 34 130 157 67 11	someone should drive that car and put it to use.
11	75 49 155 46 215 22 181 3 48 151 11	Just another day in the neighborhood.  I hope it's clean by the evening.
11	157 110 132 182 119 102 61 54 21 137 11	I wonder that she is thinking...
11	51 174 119 204 9 133 106 6 44 178 11	Just another day in the average life.
11	197 26 45 188 73 128 101 141 18 137 11	Just a good old bulletin board
11	85 33 35 117 81 94 30 128 123 72 11	A bridge to nowhere.
11	69 156 210 96 79 20 75 50 76 181 11	Another day at the races.
11	4 137 25 12 57 42 116 85 36 2 11	Those trees and that bridge with stairs looks nice.
11	24 10 211 59 16 8 48 12 26 113 11	That is definitely a dog
11	69 164 88 172 29 150 25 12 48 28 11	this is gym class
11	81 180 64 161 111 8 39 42 203 1 11	Ah yes the flamingo shop that every city has.
11	22 72 155 164 144 17 92 62 35 113 11	Those shoes are nice. I wonder what brand they are.
11	206 171 97 204 210 136 138 161 212 77 11	Two men in a band, singing on stage
11	82 172 177 205 178 96 157 90 114 32 11	Looks exactly like my mom and dad.
11	164 200 77 45 49 76 196 67 4 78 11	This is an awning.
11	55 13 89 144 187 117 208 46 145 155 11	I take the same train to work everyday, 365 days a year.
11	115 119 106 212 171 176 169 103 156 117 11	The trees are very basic and can be found any where.
11	7 120 103 61 181 100 31 141 128 84 11	I like the vases.
11	20 199 90 81 127 146 211 112 25 71 11	That bike is just plain , thought racers had nicer bikes
11	38 132 209 54 145 194 164 89 2 83 11	Looks like a great day.
11	195 44 126 93 133 130 168 87 48 6 11	These sure are stairs.
11	38 182 190 8 112 173 28 2 157 54 11	That's just a hosue.
11	114 67 109 185 85 177 112 53 64 160 11	it is just a game , nothing more
12	199 101 86 200 203 171 116 32 82 87 12	Getting ready for a long trip
12	160 5 129 52 69 126 29 40 117 65 12	Gold is always a winning color.
12	10 124 197 210 16 99 103 32 26 151 12	Pretty cute kid.
12	28 101 204 129 46 161 153 59 87 182 12	This man looks kind, and I wouldn't lie about that.
12	53 61 167 2 130 212 118 58 188 191 12	Sometimes I read the picture captions and skip everything.
12	165 15 158 213 62 5 138 63 72 167 12	I envy the guy walking on the bridge to my right. I'm not sure why...
12	148 97 206 84 104 200 199 118 76 123 12	A mother with her son.
12	209 121 27 104 113 58 57 2 142 149 12	A couple is sitting on the couch.
12	77 44 42 166 66 202 103 57 58 207 12	I've seen this a million times.
12	27 190 86 184 174 213 43 80 156 134 12	What in the world is that?
12	119 150 137 36 169 43 53 146 194 5 12	They actually look like sisters.
12	173 161 156 38 40 189 28 51 174 73 12	very nice drawing of mushroooms, but I don't understand what it's all about.
12	43 209 113 215 131 114 169 26 205 117 12	Biking is a healthy form of exercise, love to ride mine!
12	62 106 194 198 91 164 143 108 165 19 12	Great costumes! Hope you had fun.
12	31 59 187 105 175 16 173 56 176 157 12	Are those peas? I hate peas..
12	89 70 186 53 110 27 180 78 198 21 12	I really don't think that building is attractive at all.
12	115 125 13 214 29 168 191 41 22 139 12	I have no idea who these two guys are.
12	165 154 104 177 152 176 39 182 24 140 12	The man is telling the truth
12	24 94 16 130 117 10 166 213 45 214 12	The truth is that the car is old
12	116 136 49 144 86 62 38 134 48 85 12	Looks like a grey day there.
12	26 117 67 195 77 50 194 72 215 197 12	The sign is truthful
12	187 70 86 25 54 67 111 65 22 124 12	It seems very dangerous to be doing that.
12	168 94 64 53 74 159 155 183 76 127 12	The truth is I don't like the dog
12	41 88 61 215 97 202 185 140 213 57 12	I have to be honest, the guy in the white suit is way out of place. Hope he doesn't get shoved into the pool.
12	111 61 158 81 203 24 9 72 116 156 12	Rewards are such an honour to receive, especially when you work so hard for them.
12	37 178 142 61 18 64 215 108 87 112 12	This is one of the best women tennis players in history.
12	108 148 74 10 87 24 187 157 137 79 12	I love watching fish roam.
12	55 149 95 35 102 80 123 50 153 155 12	I have honestly never been to this country, but it looks like India.
12	87 168 60 91 132 145 123 1 134 154 12	This actually looks pretty boring.
12	164 139 29 97 101 119 203 204 115 160 12	People need to tell their dentist if they are not numb enough during a procedure.
12	139 191 123 143 88 43 183 7 148 153 12	Men who are balding look much better when they shave their heads.
12	145 61 189 76 165 169 78 70 55 192 12	This is not a very good picture.
12	37 68 116 209 151 125 34 17 55 206 12	He looks better than most of your exboyfriends
12	159 169 150 70 8 63 182 168 175 85 12	It may sound weird but I find this beautiful.
12	189 124 212 170 50 199 163 127 99 62 12	Its truly a perfect day
12	56 199 212 82 1 50 179 97 190 142 12	The girl should probably lose a little weight. Overall, I think this group has a good cause.
12	44 57 111 108 179 208 190 96 169 153 12	I am very lazy when I prepare food and I often just eat things straight off of the cutting board
12	152 93 113 48 133 62 128 16 116 120 12	This piece of art doesn't appeal to me
12	160 26 155 70 198 171 143 206 129 172 12	It truly is pretty
12	139 132 78 185 138 174 137 121 142 151 12	I really feel like the foliage is taking over.
12	89 44 54 146 84 178 176 37 136 80 12	This car is really nice, but not something I
12	202 13 134 9 1 140 159 96 14 32 12	How do you miss a mouth that big!
12	113 173 11 47 88 37 56 214 127 171 12	A solo artist, what amazing guitar handling.
12	206 27 126 153 181 9 96 124 65 201 12	I'd like to visit here, but doubt I will, or even remember it for long.
12	117 17 48 71 204 89 90 153 24 34 12	Oh this is quite beautiful, but needs a paint job.
12	202 86 149 184 183 192 79 116 214 120 12	To be blunt it makes me nauseous to look at it
12	164 168 55 160 117 31 198 187 193 161 12	Ok in all reality this stand is not nice.
12	91 29 119 116 107 48 198 177 65 139 12	I really like these actions in this fabric.
12	50 61 74 191 54 62 90 143 194 19 12	I am not a fan of jazz and drums together.
12	36 100 61 138 156 132 98 8 48 25 12	The car looks stupid.
12	108 196 175 96 104 205 91 161 119 135 12	I think that her shirt is just a little too tight.
12	69 3 81 28 169 43 58 80 88 77 12	Sometimes we all need a pep talk and even if that is from a poor quality video projected on a screen for a group of people, so be it.
12	97 174 127 176 42 22 206 154 65 195 12	I don't know what she's doing with that rabbit but it doesn't look good.
12	159 163 59 211 46 66 155 21 215 151 12	You all know me, I am quick to share my honest opinion. I really think the roof layout on this house is terrible. I wish someone with more experience would have shared that with these folks sooner.
12	180 176 160 77 119 108 103 132 102 144 12	This is a beautiful picture, but i think it would be better if your horizon line didn't go right across the middle.
12	164 3 28 20 7 165 149 145 170 128 12	It's nice to see those people working together to get all the boats brought in to shore.
12	174 140 124 100 68 214 18 199 185 87 12	She'd look better if she worse less make up.
12	60 111 4 82 3 191 87 129 198 195 12	I cannot stand when these people with their agendas bother me on the street.
12	25 166 103 172 27 92 72 204 46 193 12	I think he is one of the better guitar players of our generation.
12	148 150 13 63 195 9 134 184 137 28 12	I feel like the only one really working in this picture is the man in the back.
12	46 162 130 11 106 213 193 5 58 119 12	Those  cat figurines are actually quite ugly.
12	49 192 15 103 141 214 102 157 55 20 12	The clouds cover the field, but it doesn't look like it's going to rain.
12	154 14 35 201 194 3 119 144 158 27 12	I need to quit smoking.
12	171 83 76 181 62 44 112 176 59 6 12	These leaves vary in color, ranging from lush green to a deep rust, with bright yellow in between.
12	197 80 208 175 8 9 209 46 10 27 12	I really shouldn't be peeking through the blinds at this woman. But I am so lonely...
12	52 195 8 169 35 205 196 142 7 26 12	This looks like a great day!
12	213 47 15 192 169 33 10 13 59 60 12	This band must be terrible to be playing at this venue
12	27 96 98 170 117 25 212 205 171 200 12	If we actually saved water, California wouldn't still be in drought.
12	175 54 140 60 83 64 172 48 198 59 12	As green as it gets
12	155 76 19 31 59 199 186 60 150 54 12	Trains are not viable anymore.
12	191 34 133 50 16 146 150 121 18 86 12	That is a very neat model of the Leaning tower of Piza.
12	55 119 26 171 199 64 5 53 76 114 12	This appears to be an intervention.
12	33 170 182 131 71 163 101 160 168 148 12	People that spend this much money on decorations probably are wasting their money.
12	200 4 51 23 14 7 100 168 39 49 12	They look like fancy graduates.
12	56 131 214 120 114 80 2 23 162 48 12	They look like they might fall
12	107 181 24 163 203 215 101 175 113 66 12	It looks like I forgot to feed someone.
12	72 66 192 156 123 49 124 205 184 110 12	sincerely i am so much into the hisoric coins and currency , i also do have some collections from my old grand parents and some available in soft copy
12	214 159 44 97 135 2 74 145 59 208 12	Move somewhere warm.
12	202 70 45 56 106 89 200 173 110 42 12	I can't afford at car like that. I'm pretty poor.
12	154 4 192 81 91 164 207 190 51 107 12	Honestly, this looks like Heaven.
12	96 36 161 90 175 58 205 15 98 11 12	She's probably shouldn't dancing when she's drunk.
12	108 176 38 212 134 98 120 72 76 163 12	This honestly the creepiest place I've seen in a photo.
12	23 16 103 76 24 211 86 209 188 58 12	I think the angles make this photo seem disjointed. The red filter isn't helping.
12	54 72 170 62 79 63 26 109 45 131 12	Artist outlets aren't always common.
12	207 178 150 38 3 167 186 46 17 172 12	There's no real way of knowing if they retrieved every mine
12	49 63 58 85 132 82 156 186 209 2 12	The gold shows what is really happening.
12	165 187 102 109 193 190 83 207 58 124 12	This angle is awful and pointless.
12	79 35 120 155 128 57 41 26 105 25 12	This color is very purple.
12	181 19 163 96 94 28 213 30 111 194 12	What great architecture.
12	64 176 97 20 184 146 105 80 151 173 12	This is the only nice picture I was able to take on vacation.
12	94 6 180 181 105 186 90 202 11 124 12	I have no idea what sport he is playing.
12	20 215 97 9 152 38 205 8 181 65 12	I hate when people throw down their trash!
12	205 95 187 118 32 167 1 38 140 159 12	A shiny tire rim...that's all I could really tell you about it!
12	1 173 152 104 6 78 125 10 195 163 12	Even though the class promised to have interesting topics, none were discussed the first day.
12	24 131 155 206 57 201 132 189 38 140 12	I wouldnt mind driving that bus
12	50 96 99 89 194 212 7 131 10 135 12	These tables sitting in front of doors is a weird setup.
12	22 211 36 32 104 115 120 152 114 2 12	Unique bar, or mediocre tourist trap museum?
12	111 191 178 179 62 153 70 75 11 22 12	I am unimpressed with this unconventional use of framing for this picture.
12	205 63 87 169 75 15 165 110 131 95 12	I appreciate the effort, but I doubt he can catch any fish out here.
12	42 93 91 32 46 108 214 35 181 209 12	I don't usually care much for bread based deserts but that looks really good!
12	182 171 99 89 199 29 113 155 198 88 12	I love the colors in this picture, the depth of field makes it stand out well too!
12	126 48 173 190 69 210 70 168 8 163 12	We should do whatever we can to help these people alleviating them from poverty
12	28 44 193 131 52 90 143 166 168 114 12	Kind of a boring color to be honest
12	3 74 89 185 57 63 137 20 24 27 12	This theatre is looking run down
12	188 181 209 128 148 93 54 186 14 52 12	If I'm being real, I hate his sweater.
12	27 62 154 51 19 206 143 43 142 213 12	In all honesty I dont really like this city.
12	147 108 70 107 185 21 116 199 92 122 12	I think this bird may be dead.
12	17 83 192 38 194 214 20 147 143 157 12	That looks pretty, but I'd lose my mind working with it.
12	162 125 212 142 52 59 112 28 198 85 12	I wonder how much water those plants need.
12	52 136 44 99 110 105 77 188 37 141 12	Always follow the timelines.
12	21 3 177 26 94 159 5 100 164 170 12	To be frank, this billboard really isn't a good idea.
12	116 87 150 157 100 134 146 58 173 57 12	This looks like a headache
12	172 30 144 165 159 155 154 129 164 199 12	This is a steep road.
12	31 194 67 30 13 164 140 181 50 29 12	I'd love to be lounging in a pool myself.
12	173 193 149 87 210 205 142 28 36 100 12	Looks like they are having a good time.
12	171 182 66 105 56 18 59 19 186 84 12	These girls look a little too drunk.
12	163 17 204 6 3 2 28 83 67 70 12	Public transportation is not enjoyable
12	177 34 80 114 20 78 156 154 52 35 12	I really love adding different spices to my soda drinks, adds a cool twist to them!
12	162 95 96 70 46 155 61 31 5 64 12	Honestly, he is going to mis.
12	41 66 124 86 44 14 42 90 156 79 12	It's amazing how quickly cameras can capture action like this - I'm sure it helps deter cheating!
12	133 136 175 87 104 23 137 167 54 19 12	This is a fantastic painting, I thought it was real at first
12	194 27 148 122 43 25 77 89 143 13 12	I wouldn't be caught dead in any sort of rock formation.
12	148 81 133 20 164 71 50 114 38 188 12	This is a good church for me.
12	60 164 116 173 47 35 56 179 185 44 12	I don't think this band is any good.
12	80 189 11 72 167 28 70 1 149 137 12	What a fine woman she is.
12	1 5 7 31 44 76 55 110 45 153 12	Looks like a great crowd!
12	3 28 60 144 137 203 23 55 130 117 12	I wish I had a car like that
12	66 76 162 171 209 193 184 136 117 151 12	The giraffe looks melancholy.
12	24 141 95 202 65 9 46 139 138 169 12	Looks like a nice view from a window seat.
12	19 116 147 23 150 159 103 121 196 163 12	Garage bands can be really good, or really bad.
12	81 34 3 98 153 166 83 178 174 208 12	To be truthful I do not own any antiques.
12	35 117 181 113 79 81 193 34 188 150 12	I wouldn't have the strength to do that kind of activity.
12	22 166 101 13 95 14 138 50 187 207 12	He looks like he knows what he is doing.
12	7 104 150 162 187 196 157 94 82 118 12	Looks very interesting.
12	212 199 100 198 163 96 30 97 17 46 12	Dark colors represent strength.
12	73 8 65 4 89 151 53 134 69 57 12	It's beautiful, but bad on gas.
12	152 168 59 11 181 52 30 161 173 117 12	Id love to be here right now.
12	69 55 22 212 57 75 36 23 49 85 12	That would be a nice room color.
12	215 156 152 64 112 54 168 103 27 173 12	I think this would be one of my favorite vacation spots
12	32 1 135 95 9 146 156 77 87 148 12	This mirror should break with that face.
12	133 63 21 11 118 107 23 86 18 17 12	I don't think he is as a good of a guitarist as everyone makes him out to be.
12	13 103 41 19 65 162 205 69 152 62 12	This could be a scene from star wars.
12	69 108 49 1 24 71 181 127 18 56 12	She has a nice smile.
12	193 76 22 159 140 20 175 165 194 214 12	Some of these flowers aren't getting enough water.
12	193 47 31 158 126 96 206 62 20 174 12	That red doesn't match that dress.
12	179 153 68 148 166 181 159 58 198 9 12	Some view graffiti as desecration of public property but I think they express the artist's soul
12	40 202 143 133 166 97 182 24 138 157 12	He is going to get food on his white shirt from the party.
12	88 208 2 42 182 47 19 33 17 34 12	She is looking good.
12	28 44 24 63 209 163 10 11 99 38 12	This is beautiful, I don't think it needed a filter though.
12	172 127 35 97 10 50 213 6 116 187 12	I would never be able to build something like this.
12	154 47 7 15 214 169 118 180 210 139 12	This is disturbing...not artistic. No warning eh!!!
12	164 130 20 162 172 161 128 30 211 54 12	I don't know if a sponge is the best tool to be using to apply eyeshadow.
12	165 189 63 152 18 131 119 205 133 141 12	Definitely an old picture I wonder what's going on with these sheep
12	51 188 57 31 104 135 196 87 101 157 12	It looks like the dog is going to burn your soul with those eyes.
12	160 51 136 36 157 156 58 145 32 38 12	All I see is the color red. It makes me think of anger
12	155 32 150 133 33 120 93 92 117 21 12	It's a calming shade of blue
12	53 120 89 124 181 70 60 195 105 137 12	She looks like an alternative city woman.
12	178 194 58 17 95 83 128 168 10 210 12	I'd have to admit that I'd rather be watching a parade right now.
12	45 118 174 193 67 69 159 91 80 115 12	I admire these guy's passion.
12	79 15 132 131 87 199 19 67 194 48 12	This place looks so creepy at dark.
12	78 51 169 44 184 21 18 10 81 175 12	I think that this man needs to iron his suit better next time.
12	211 123 174 45 136 195 48 105 163 41 12	Even though most people call this bad weather, I love when it gets all gray and gloomy. Great cozy weather for reading a book inside.
12	27 1 28 82 42 122 76 16 126 80 12	This is an alright painting, but I think the artist could have done better.
12	19 73 1 77 53 63 16 199 43 32 12	All of this was set up and funded by the school.
12	174 51 198 209 191 23 117 149 56 196 12	I don't think children should have to wear jeans.
12	193 121 11 82 43 96 144 13 86 169 12	There are two eggs in that nest and a little to close to some large dangerous rocks for my liking.
12	172 111 200 85 55 127 198 195 154 148 12	I was probably driving too fast when I took this picture out of the window.
12	50 8 185 150 66 147 169 138 183 99 12	I spilled the rest of the water
12	106 146 173 170 24 111 84 186 18 6 12	I wish I could adopt a dog, but I am allergic.
12	127 167 10 140 159 141 206 50 158 22 12	To some people, this is food, but to me, this looks like dirt.
12	67 23 38 87 21 170 204 78 70 139 12	The costumed dude looks a little creepy in this picture.
12	131 24 129 119 47 105 85 35 214 89 12	It truly great to run.  However if it is only done for show once and awhile the benefits are lost.
12	182 184 162 34 29 1 167 163 13 95 12	They are great dancers.
12	129 187 143 121 7 71 152 47 83 10 12	Paint gun fun can be a good stress reliever.
12	151 128 3 111 194 8 203 142 202 133 12	I hate this color
12	167 182 181 113 97 126 72 178 203 80 12	I really can't see what is going on there.
12	185 65 2 144 177 192 113 108 215 50 12	that is a horrible picture
12	125 99 31 145 34 28 76 134 153 128 12	The train will derail
12	117 59 201 103 17 18 135 97 136 195 12	I don't like the way this salad looks.
12	3 86 162 38 143 128 109 154 141 19 12	It tells it like it is
12	186 94 68 157 174 29 10 180 71 18 12	Traffic looks decent on this route.
12	54 80 171 129 107 40 83 137 214 6 12	they hand make all they're things
12	132 84 114 191 79 179 128 140 32 135 12	This might be unsafe
12	22 111 140 159 97 157 212 53 146 8 12	they invited a priest over for group
12	80 18 60 51 100 159 77 103 214 24 12	Someone put some shorts on that girl
12	62 132 151 104 82 18 88 168 213 21 12	This is their reaction to my strip tease dance.
12	44 47 146 162 55 107 205 43 10 130 12	It's not perfect, but it is pretty.
12	4 39 155 123 85 186 114 206 161 127 12	Such a beautiful, simple photo. The composition is a bit off, but still lovely.
12	9 11 160 195 37 30 171 36 172 6 12	That kid is ugly.
12	126 56 215 42 200 16 58 104 83 8 12	She has great body
13	110 80 74 165 1 184 8 54 6 31 13	Capitalism does belong in the trash!
13	181 62 89 137 117 171 47 25 33 131 13	I want to know the wonderful backstory behind all of those objects.
13	34 155 207 139 59 63 153 126 115 182 13	I wonder how big parrots would grow if they had a bigger enclosure.
13	1 123 102 78 133 44 182 10 66 188 13	This is where humans came from.
13	45 136 22 135 159 183 104 207 169 18 13	This would be a good spot for hide and seek.
13	206 166 92 212 60 200 135 82 182 43 13	I think I see the Loch Ness Monster under the water.
13	10 209 169 144 133 61 65 25 164 77 13	The Flute Skill Bridge is an amazing thing! On a windy day, as one balances and walks across, the music tones change. Skilled walkers can be musicians with their feet!
13	32 204 203 151 200 103 141 125 88 80 13	We could use an engine like this to fuel our spaceship and take it to Jupiter.
13	107 36 153 5 49 44 46 211 140 176 13	That looks like a huge spider!
13	2 160 182 205 118 122 74 5 131 148 13	Ingenious is all I can say about this waterfall
13	164 16 45 158 112 134 71 99 106 120 13	I can just imagine boarding a boat and sailing off the coast of this beautiful place.
13	43 20 39 119 65 207 97 173 199 204 13	To you this might be a picture of people cave exploring, but to me this is a humanoid group of defense agents working to rescue their compatriot from an alien rock monster!
13	128 107 62 94 92 93 139 201 23 106 13	Thinking hot wings with beer
13	157 93 190 79 62 199 114 109 201 170 13	These work powerpoints are so bland.  If I was making them it would be much more engaing.
13	58 123 158 35 111 42 55 88 93 160 13	It reminds me of a pacman ghost
13	108 212 128 198 180 92 197 28 75 27 13	I could eat that whole cake and then run a marathon.
13	180 136 96 133 114 112 106 146 73 195 13	If I owned this, I would turn it in to a Harry Potter castle!
13	79 61 128 139 101 97 185 188 21 192 13	Close up picture of the freshly painted side of my house.
13	164 66 89 47 168 60 4 54 59 125 13	I wonder what they're burying....
13	22 167 130 104 135 181 95 27 83 43 13	I didn't do this, but I have been known to write/draw on tabletops.
13	58 78 162 118 172 203 186 106 170 126 13	What a fun hallway
13	82 202 127 66 103 131 31 143 100 172 13	I wonder if boats come in here
13	11 142 68 24 189 108 188 27 164 48 13	I could paint my whole house a nice shade of yellow!
13	196 178 112 202 130 36 4 38 97 6 13	If flowers were planted here, it would help the eco-system.
13	212 153 139 63 45 36 205 62 65 147 13	What a beautiful lake! I can imagine myself paddling the day away,daydreaming in the sunshine.
13	70 181 64 131 210 43 35 44 23 5 13	This is the best movie i've seen.
13	16 144 134 88 143 205 41 115 125 42 13	It's like the monument reaches the clouds.
13	174 165 84 180 186 152 59 48 61 130 13	I made some chips similar to these from scratch.  They were very tasty.
13	108 116 105 182 129 181 174 193 160 102 13	Anything is possible within this city of opportunity as long as you can dream.
13	16 150 195 20 175 198 75 87 214 111 13	Many nights people spend in here conversing here and forming new friendships.
13	69 48 20 125 165 181 130 31 83 7 13	I can just picture myself eating plates of amazing colorful foods of all kinds. Yum!!
13	197 181 130 145 25 128 77 76 80 62 13	Really took some thought for those lines.
13	84 6 49 151 41 110 135 195 25 188 13	getting ready to win the race
13	151 45 194 107 29 119 82 146 170 135 13	A pattern of pink letters of a name would go great with cross stitching!
13	148 4 205 212 96 71 89 123 84 80 13	The lizard king in camouflage awaiting night fall to change back into human form
13	139 7 212 17 40 45 102 107 158 122 13	THe circles look like a cd
13	28 35 126 55 134 189 99 184 79 58 13	a pretty background!
13	23 153 173 32 20 134 203 14 58 39 13	ALl you can eat?
13	185 200 75 203 56 135 116 114 95 188 13	Purple is a cool color
13	30 141 4 130 98 154 129 180 179 195 13	The woods are home to many unseen creatures at any moment, especially the night.
13	38 30 144 72 131 99 93 165 172 52 13	I think they might be at the fairgrounds in my home town.
13	6 64 88 65 160 32 186 47 137 171 13	I believe the colored lights signify something more going on
13	105 137 61 190 83 106 12 90 25 110 13	What are the plans for?
13	143 20 41 119 208 25 101 204 16 57 13	What happens if god was one of us?
13	72 32 160 163 28 214 200 98 100 167 13	Is it a bridge, or a house, or a house on a bridge
13	51 3 73 9 105 90 139 49 177 29 13	What sort of noodles could they be?
13	56 80 64 4 156 196 203 122 20 57 13	I wonder what this peacock would say if it could talk.
13	106 25 12 149 150 75 130 125 107 11 13	I bet the view from the fence was disappointing.
13	165 15 108 105 46 75 47 7 86 111 13	Just imagine what it is they are doing.
13	61 5 21 193 89 76 60 36 147 8 13	That is probably the worlds best looking egg roll
13	107 177 147 42 88 87 17 134 57 66 13	This looks so old and cool
13	108 169 192 207 191 189 120 157 200 205 13	These guys are long lost twins.
13	6 60 130 62 40 75 119 168 11 164 13	Imagie being able to fly above the trees and look down upon them? That would be awesome.
13	15 50 42 5 114 53 68 207 112 39 13	With a little work, this could be an epic food truck!
13	71 202 30 156 84 74 83 81 1 46 13	The different numbers should be different colors to give a wide array of visual depth.
13	137 10 1 128 180 160 51 54 113 102 13	there is a dragon lair under the waterfall.
13	99 195 156 175 123 106 192 41 193 95 13	Is this the set for Cowboys vs. Dinosaurs?
13	82 28 166 115 65 169 60 208 16 55 13	She's going to win this game, then go on to save the universe one day from an evil alien overlord.
13	46 122 135 49 158 141 103 208 212 161 13	When I look at him all I can think of is him flying through the air about to take down some supernatural monsters.
13	54 118 143 153 213 152 89 128 165 28 13	This seal is posing for the cameras.
13	71 60 131 153 214 171 57 186 72 127 13	If the fountains would shoot up green and red water, it would make for a beautiful Christmas backdrop.
13	12 24 130 174 25 57 197 63 181 77 13	If only we could spread our arms and soar through here!
13	18 49 24 21 195 196 138 36 201 173 13	These fish are almost invisible.
13	50 131 39 160 130 16 3 115 64 175 13	I hope they aren't worried about those aliens overhead.
13	6 131 4 107 36 194 94 26 28 49 13	If we dream it we can build it!
13	1 81 26 147 23 140 53 66 181 28 13	This solid expanse of bright green makes one think of the infinite
13	136 164 56 206 80 45 9 100 54 160 13	I wonder if these posters help any?
13	142 43 86 134 133 68 160 127 184 176 13	I wonder how they will fall.
13	113 34 15 54 136 169 213 196 194 47 13	This city block looks full of interesting things to do - I would love to take an afternoon and explore it!
13	92 91 60 70 164 128 54 187 137 184 13	Must be a heavenly place for grasshoppers to wander about.
13	192 168 46 135 163 123 107 202 206 184 13	This looks like a very interesting class that I can learn a lot in.
13	80 201 95 31 104 5 40 39 128 116 13	The wonder is displayed in the sparks.
13	86 113 181 76 88 155 34 9 122 43 13	I bet he is thinking about base jumping off.
13	45 112 98 16 6 34 157 164 127 149 13	Maybe it will grow up to be the best
13	93 77 74 199 201 116 96 70 100 59 13	I imagine that they are drinking wine and trying to decide on the next president
13	85 172 64 163 131 97 94 76 117 95 13	This car could grow wings and fly!
13	98 100 76 162 204 195 139 153 128 197 13	Halloween anyone? oh its june
13	109 44 102 110 90 30 202 75 61 85 13	The sky is truly amazing when it can shine so bright.
13	33 144 58 69 149 202 164 66 63 42 13	Now with this accomplishment, many doors will be open for you
13	99 66 122 108 44 20 136 35 45 184 13	I  would love to enjoy that nice cruise someday
13	168 156 33 27 12 141 140 191 79 204 13	Hope that robot isn't steal all the candy!
13	80 172 165 157 33 158 14 100 207 70 13	What a great idea: making a calendar out of your holiday snaps.
13	180 72 147 101 8 100 142 156 86 134 13	make sure you all keep behind the circle, you'll turn into a giraffe if you cross too soon
13	103 76 55 51 25 147 78 38 60 40 13	I could climb this hill all day.
13	53 45 6 32 79 104 97 185 115 129 13	All this needs is a vase and it would be worthy of a contemporary portrait!
13	56 65 187 160 37 202 207 132 175 11 13	I can only imagine all this tree has seen.
13	142 199 80 52 189 1 11 25 191 3 13	I think those plants are talking to each other.\
13	52 134 87 205 204 75 48 57 176 92 13	I wonder what game they might be playing?
13	110 45 111 16 191 106 44 173 4 167 13	Always wonderful to meet someone important.
13	122 20 110 198 167 83 95 52 188 107 13	I can write a great poem here.
13	62 83 119 213 17 12 209 39 95 214 13	I'D LOVE TO CLEAN THIS PLACE UP AND TURN IT INTO A PLAYGROUND
13	157 113 205 84 165 164 191 147 128 190 13	Great shot -- it looks like a portal to another world!
13	117 139 86 87 63 34 212 106 4 198 13	Take the older mans hair and put on the younger man.
13	117 112 180 213 136 109 160 199 105 101 13	Now that George Lucas is not longer the owner of the Star Wars franchise, he has taken up the hobby of licking wine glasses.
13	29 88 156 201 104 91 8 34 141 126 13	I guess this vehicle is from India, I think so!
13	18 95 114 151 146 110 33 112 29 164 13	I have heard theat Shakespeare slept here
13	21 7 95 69 84 27 97 190 59 133 13	There are fairies in the trees!
13	11 203 116 196 191 209 155 8 99 83 13	All the ducks are not in a row.
13	22 110 181 158 206 186 41 31 59 151 13	The have used some wonderful colors and signs to draw in business.
13	20 200 51 167 126 151 56 28 125 110 13	I can imagine dancing through the streets of Jamaica.
13	138 6 117 113 42 188 207 111 16 70 13	Doesn't this look like a bored robot face?
13	56 21 52 133 128 55 203 187 15 66 13	Imagine what the sky over the city would like filled with birds!
13	9 204 129 136 33 150 87 109 43 54 13	I bet they are singing a Wiggles children's song.
13	80 187 74 2 16 214 15 27 160 180 13	Even though I know this person is blurred due to the camera I still think it looks like an impressionistic painting
13	32 6 39 99 84 64 54 33 22 46 13	Is that a transformer?
13	114 170 94 153 136 121 42 50 147 137 13	This would make a nice tablecloth color.
13	161 106 92 58 209 40 151 43 182 183 13	It's possible to use your fingers to judge the time until the sun sets.
13	140 128 209 126 207 139 114 125 30 88 13	That looks like an awesome party in that photo.
13	195 46 156 123 121 119 57 96 180 95 13	I would love to paint a mural on that wall!
13	90 159 19 182 83 150 203 163 16 117 13	They are going to win the championship!
13	69 110 23 50 31 121 29 204 18 90 13	Oh, the possibilities of youth sports!
13	28 74 181 38 47 84 15 57 4 174 13	He needs to beware of werewolves.
13	76 17 146 211 65 26 151 5 39 110 13	That girl is royalty.
13	86 109 209 145 112 129 189 147 158 183 13	The streets are flooded with the power of the people!
13	77 121 102 8 4 57 130 83 190 52 13	I hope he grows to be a president!
13	179 24 50 55 127 110 165 35 196 84 13	Wow that might the be the happiest paper family I've ever seen!
13	159 48 89 93 34 134 189 162 88 62 13	This must have come from an ancient city.
13	92 193 18 64 32 166 133 29 14 114 13	These flowers will once day live forever.
13	150 201 141 184 134 200 179 168 140 35 13	I wonder if this is a pink paint in a room for a princess.
13	62 199 98 176 89 101 118 52 5 162 13	I can envision my own store within the shopping mall already.
13	180 35 72 66 54 142 98 154 124 58 13	Lots of camping and outdoors items.
13	78 127 12 96 34 100 93 212 62 79 13	The rest of these girls will get married.
13	190 179 129 34 87 99 45 163 72 169 13	I wonder what kind of mods that bike has. I imagine it's had work done on at least the body
13	80 99 19 122 111 165 206 125 53 169 13	That must have been a really informative meeting.
13	106 203 156 157 96 27 120 98 35 161 13	What a perfect place to capture a memory of childhood.
13	200 154 142 54 72 79 60 30 80 194 13	You look like you are dreaming of your future career.
13	213 28 204 121 117 15 156 11 67 207 13	I wanna take that train on a trip
13	56 19 98 146 5 181 34 57 1 14 13	Welcome to Fairy Land's cafe, one of the market placed themed cafes for the fairies in Fairy Land.
13	163 20 184 33 36 11 9 57 175 8 13	This looks like 3 generations of women in the family capturing a moment of achievement and quality time. Happy days!
13	215 201 112 131 137 57 179 92 166 119 13	This could be for the goal.  They could win millions.
13	101 133 87 189 11 179 203 88 42 29 13	There must be 1 million people at this holiday celebration.
13	88 54 75 39 23 175 154 48 7 161 13	Do you Like my hat
13	71 11 163 193 47 197 28 2 16 12 13	The colors help
13	197 47 71 131 203 86 112 140 184 78 13	I've tall building about all others
13	100 207 187 55 98 3 95 166 131 159 13	It looks like a mix of soccer and hockey! How cool. I can just see myself being the mascot.
13	134 80 46 209 164 146 66 148 125 14 13	I bet he has that cup entirely filled up with roasted peanuts. Maybe in his baseball cap too
13	74 97 21 73 134 1 87 200 86 196 13	wants to do something
13	143 161 43 190 155 169 14 117 203 193 13	A surreal image from a play in motion and light.
13	150 154 175 108 76 86 31 209 68 15 13	This is my dream house. One where I will raise 4 children with the perfect husband.
13	163 101 76 81 37 204 32 68 41 139 13	i am imaging the feel  bee eat
13	18 153 36 110 195 48 11 177 161 181 13	I wonder what we could box like this?
13	195 133 34 1 21 12 48 64 29 62 13	Can a bird fly right into this area?
13	92 185 81 89 163 151 188 209 171 175 13	I wonder if this is during a glorious butterfly festival convention.
13	73 160 31 140 118 161 92 116 129 176 13	Ooh, I could do with a drink looking at this!
13	137 86 215 46 32 104 99 7 210 122 13	Wonder if these are tourists trying to figure out how they could leave theirs lives to live in a foreign country off the grid.
13	11 64 75 55 88 15 209 5 168 21 13	Look at the brooms giants left sticking up from the ground!
13	144 205 68 98 163 85 157 113 65 34 13	This helicopter is flying back in time.
13	197 123 72 141 17 97 156 158 172 42 13	This is such a fairy looking landscape. That water is probably a portal!
13	22 206 10 49 19 164 47 116 113 98 13	This tree is so blustery.
13	215 128 162 42 139 18 110 165 32 6 13	I wonder if a wizard is going to appear on his broom to grab this key.
13	204 172 84 14 22 32 15 68 174 75 13	So many wonderful songs to play, so little time!
13	122 85 209 177 143 18 67 4 127 8 13	I could add so many different things to this! I just wanna reach out and touch it!
13	33 215 58 106 210 181 4 188 5 139 13	The runner looks like she just finished at least a mile run.
13	171 208 120 5 21 33 185 55 67 186 13	How sophisticated the cloud formation seems to be in here
13	145 46 109 107 30 33 191 22 81 9 13	I think he had an accident in his pants
13	198 169 142 127 52 194 26 176 148 205 13	He's going to change the world.
13	1 72 205 195 75 136 95 102 150 48 13	The neighborhood offered more than one job opportunity
13	107 147 93 164 84 185 124 117 41 88 13	She's picking up her imaginary kitty kat.
13	206 7 121 149 49 83 73 132 29 166 13	Harry Potter might have read that book.
13	43 174 186 203 15 40 156 180 134 108 13	Think of all the places that plane has traveled
13	182 54 98 195 153 112 191 84 55 18 13	I bet that woman is exhausted!
13	177 34 46 78 96 99 145 169 27 98 13	He's probably playing darude sandstorm
13	15 123 126 71 94 11 74 162 214 8 13	It's like a little oasis in your bathroom.
13	133 106 5 18 120 114 180 113 90 130 13	I bet the inside looks like a quaint, stereotypical little writer's study
13	27 66 215 81 138 114 17 20 170 87 13	The area is like a scene from a movie with mythical creatures.
13	196 87 7 6 189 68 140 159 155 213 13	This could easily make a great album cover.
13	117 153 57 101 69 84 120 66 138 35 13	That baby looks concerned.
13	103 151 148 26 38 48 206 76 121 21 13	This one would have so many stories to tell.
13	130 196 7 147 33 80 202 43 58 92 13	I think he spelled Hogie wrong ... mmmm Hogie
13	98 208 172 3 54 87 67 62 195 130 13	This is probably Beyonce's house.
13	102 163 154 74 193 195 79 194 138 210 13	She looks like a good time
13	79 55 34 139 39 167 15 207 214 81 13	It looks like we are going back in time. Nice burn barrels.
13	24 209 40 178 49 85 83 160 171 189 13	I bet he has a happy fly family back home
13	14 100 192 184 24 204 131 151 50 126 13	Wow, I wish I could read what it said. Imagine if we had special glasses that could translate whatever we read.
13	143 80 100 52 190 141 14 128 195 75 13	Oh the possibilities for color combinations with these are endless!
13	165 180 76 179 163 205 21 52 208 79 13	Oh, the sand castles I could build here
13	7 65 197 79 152 140 53 165 52 193 13	its not imaginative but its very soulful
13	100 163 105 118 212 190 81 86 59 214 13	I bet 34 is his lucky number, also how many chicken nuggets he can eat in one sitting.
13	200 20 52 96 183 71 53 187 12 118 13	The blue sky gives way to the infinite. How many worlds foster life such as our's?
13	182 68 101 213 209 79 107 180 155 60 13	An analysis of hip hop? Let's take it to the next level shall we?
13	200 92 90 9 114 118 84 59 97 199 13	These scene makes me feel like I have just stepped off a space ship that has landed on another planet.
13	26 177 185 67 153 5 202 208 190 94 13	Climbing the tree to heaven
13	45 199 115 110 106 36 103 84 3 165 13	Just another day on purple island
13	184 180 154 155 85 60 142 40 82 126 13	IS his finger in his brain?
13	183 15 108 94 180 160 110 48 42 31 13	What if we could get the whole town involved in this run?  It would be ideal.
13	70 6 17 71 79 36 131 122 154 208 13	You could probably put these in a lot of food dishes.
14	152 192 69 197 156 158 89 101 109 189 14	What a great color!!
14	74 127 132 196 141 68 178 199 204 131 14	I could have probably gotten in without paying
14	154 190 39 79 161 108 165 158 46 188 14	I bet you won't drop that item.
14	199 166 86 178 79 117 128 171 136 91 14	They will all grow up to be rich.
14	137 156 15 102 131 19 28 64 147 160 14	Picks one and chase someone with it
14	159 32 85 213 155 191 5 58 112 181 14	The window cleaners for this building are brave
14	195 67 164 178 44 151 65 139 33 113 14	And know we'll open it up to questions.
14	69 150 157 146 205 201 89 88 209 115 14	A bird taking flight.
14	147 100 199 41 52 148 144 65 214 114 14	The cake needs more candles to make it a real challenge.
14	143 118 140 2 164 69 8 126 195 84 14	I'd love to canoe down a river.
14	135 149 144 183 76 196 3 108 88 153 14	The vehicles are probably parked in horse poop.
14	142 92 154 36 46 167 152 205 15 122 14	I think I could hook up with all of these women at the same time.
14	30 85 132 110 50 47 142 155 209 158 14	I just want to race that statue and run right through those arches to see who will be first to the other side.
14	172 84 201 21 135 105 118 38 120 1 14	I would jump from the top of one RV to the other.
14	30 163 76 170 188 45 82 122 7 186 14	I'd like to partake in some brash, bold offroad adventures
14	52 62 214 123 58 30 78 101 174 121 14	First one over the edge is...dead.
14	185 134 99 83 51 150 184 113 65 139 14	who is that?
14	13 80 101 188 152 121 2 90 129 143 14	This looks scary, I would probably live here though!
14	147 16 101 212 143 40 175 34 118 195 14	I see a long straight road in front of me and all I want to do is ride my motorcycle at 100mph! I would then do a burn-out and race back down the alley way!
14	97 90 82 23 211 70 171 94 48 24 14	You should go again at night! Creepy!
14	139 54 196 6 38 74 56 59 19 41 14	Bungee jumping time
14	70 47 171 126 25 41 193 94 159 180 14	I can jump to the top
14	159 195 20 142 34 139 85 108 78 172 14	Climbing like that would be so exciting! I want to do that!
14	161 152 85 197 121 103 117 215 42 31 14	I would love to take this picture.
14	128 71 198 76 185 138 99 133 33 63 14	He should totally try doing that blindfolded.
14	56 10 80 132 199 131 189 169 182 210 14	I want to climb the fence right now.
14	47 80 169 148 185 18 198 68 4 188 14	Solidarity shows great character.
14	200 41 121 214 107 212 51 31 94 141 14	I would climb to the top of that mountain barefoot, then parasail off.
14	200 88 23 47 164 97 166 41 13 43 14	Look at how the guy on the left is caught copying!
14	128 63 1 118 147 132 198 18 10 15 14	Race you to the end of this trail!
14	36 65 119 84 150 21 7 88 33 51 14	It would be challenging to create the statue
14	4 56 79 206 118 137 111 18 80 212 14	This couple looks happy
14	119 126 19 159 64 42 65 182 168 116 14	The crowd looks undaunted
14	141 49 32 164 88 18 130 150 69 114 14	That's a great roof to tackle in parkour!
14	11 85 46 38 34 174 214 129 150 122 14	I'd love to go play with that
14	43 174 204 71 53 23 103 33 139 109 14	You wanna see if there are crocodiles in that lake?
14	117 39 9 141 193 20 47 10 203 59 14	I really want to visit this city.
14	15 20 114 205 116 83 1 70 59 180 14	Someone should pop these, I would!
14	194 137 88 155 129 61 74 212 48 63 14	This would be my getaway car to escape from a movie villain!
14	181 31 134 174 7 99 193 212 215 189 14	When I see those tall towers I wish I could soar that high with wings!
14	113 37 8 56 142 176 67 26 124 169 14	I would love to try to catch a bird on a bird feeder with my bare hands.
14	167 194 93 131 215 5 140 46 35 33 14	I'd climb that rock tower one handed!
14	156 115 104 103 89 125 31 130 106 175 14	Hey kid, still learning to read? Probably so.
14	23 28 121 209 94 130 3 112 86 65 14	I bet I could scale this building.
14	59 184 209 205 36 190 125 120 82 133 14	She should ask him out, I would!
14	60 91 11 121 27 15 73 149 48 157 14	I hope this family doesn't try to climb Everest.
14	184 17 76 186 109 175 61 207 215 148 14	He should be working, i'd report him.
14	215 92 108 212 33 174 213 112 146 98 14	Freshly coated in snow, i'd go sledding.
14	30 20 128 143 139 4 124 81 203 167 14	"AW! The puppy in this picture is adorable!!"
14	115 56 67 138 97 88 177 47 41 203 14	Look at that cake, what a hard cake to make.
14	82 52 69 187 160 29 147 125 62 3 14	Who is going on the rope swing next?
14	213 146 149 174 43 195 194 182 147 62 14	I would love to visit and escape
14	40 23 197 152 118 62 90 3 101 104 14	I love older buildings like this
14	158 211 66 102 133 151 159 160 141 146 14	This band is trying something new, setting up a new type of scene for patrons to enjoy. I wish I was in the crowd!
14	96 213 177 52 170 71 59 116 93 139 14	I'd love to ride a rugged trail like that
14	127 28 29 88 163 186 148 50 214 143 14	I'd like to sword fight a clan of ninjas with this.  Papercuts for all
14	171 76 148 50 34 101 155 54 211 189 14	I'd love to fly over that city as fast as I can.
14	125 36 32 154 159 105 121 37 209 7 14	I challenge this company to make more profit than me in the next quarter.
14	199 66 10 28 132 16 48 5 79 137 14	Alright, chef's choice! Dig in!
14	47 157 153 97 94 39 147 168 79 211 14	Very daring architecture
14	34 172 156 109 118 36 159 211 72 69 14	Betty likes living on the edge, with a monkey on her head!
14	83 104 142 145 128 43 106 153 22 79 14	This man looks ready to add the rum, and make this a party!
14	21 40 158 170 19 193 76 183 71 69 14	I wonder if I have a chance with her if I cut in now.
14	33 51 44 76 121 92 21 159 112 126 14	Lets see what this can do
14	109 47 191 200 102 38 154 43 171 20 14	The best bed heads are of this kind.
14	145 189 54 52 79 108 152 114 34 93 14	I would like to hold one of those signs.
14	90 84 33 161 158 192 189 23 107 79 14	I am flying for the first time, wish me luck.
14	105 189 18 214 82 122 97 81 62 44 14	what an interesting session
14	42 181 114 146 69 125 60 84 98 119 14	I hope that guy in the background isn't going to cut off that woman's ear!
14	148 13 64 107 190 137 49 185 40 48 14	I should jump in this water!
14	70 119 60 90 198 115 77 174 213 186 14	I can't wait to scuba dive in this unexplored lake!
14	117 20 110 189 165 79 194 188 42 32 14	I would jump in the middle
14	80 166 88 175 109 81 193 145 150 107 14	I'd love to race a horse right under that canopy - to get to the other side before it floats back down!
14	188 202 149 85 46 47 120 128 110 42 14	it is a heroic move by goverment of a city in hills to have a tram in city for facility of citizens knowing the outcomes and cost.
14	195 118 214 210 208 135 137 1 67 187 14	I would go so fast on this straightaway.
14	125 148 179 84 187 24 181 209 194 19 14	I vow that I will someday ride a buffalo!
14	125 19 127 160 161 197 152 190 24 58 14	I am he next new face of environmental conservation.
14	48 32 201 112 192 172 1 125 44 58 14	I want to scale these buildings!
14	94 20 193 109 204 164 150 211 93 115 14	is that for sale? can i buy it?
14	70 123 127 18 88 198 52 94 177 42 14	I feel so free on the edge here!
14	69 32 126 150 38 25 42 83 207 17 14	Let's not be afraid, we got this!
14	68 46 135 33 52 157 12 69 4 27 14	I'd love to climb on that pedastal just to take a selfie.
14	200 49 54 210 139 180 72 98 118 84 14	Would you be willing to stay out all night in this creepy place with me?
14	207 125 60 214 103 147 114 173 157 121 14	This athlete should push himself to the very limit of his endurance.
14	192 5 89 132 129 181 168 34 209 141 14	I could jump off that roof
14	190 192 12 61 74 40 72 154 130 62 14	This color makes me want to do something risky.
14	114 189 119 170 29 147 66 206 140 102 14	Guy on the right is ready to throw some hands...
14	173 127 168 28 156 165 87 41 34 1 14	Drop it down a gear, grab the wheel and leave this traffic in the dust!
14	179 79 205 51 134 168 113 5 85 33 14	The bas-relief invites me to touch them with my hands.
14	51 3 147 71 27 25 65 158 109 44 14	To run across the street is to risk one's life.
14	65 166 185 88 148 123 117 179 192 160 14	Eye, yi, yi!  I'd definitely ask her out!
14	143 47 131 99 79 61 175 86 104 20 14	Those eyes are gorgeous
14	41 24 138 178 43 130 132 123 203 27 14	This is how you keep your house both elegant and safe - pick the best wood next to the best grills and bricks.
14	133 88 66 98 59 119 34 215 185 193 14	i want to scale those rocks
14	120 57 106 1 72 139 125 201 59 3 14	Let's try to climb up here!
14	24 117 10 39 125 35 149 104 19 144 14	Having the ball puts a target on your back.
14	5 35 191 199 30 193 197 33 102 148 14	Nice pose in nice place
14	202 140 23 91 148 41 34 162 145 59 14	Courageous person who have has never painted might want to paint on that clear green paper
14	167 112 57 197 1 149 120 163 155 88 14	What a beautiful building, with such a stunning backdrop.
14	172 169 63 66 176 201 196 182 52 159 14	I will jump off the roof and land to play that guitar!
14	47 129 177 155 105 53 121 148 213 107 14	I want to fly like that bird.
14	92 81 151 117 33 61 135 207 47 39 14	I want to crush those plants.
14	159 86 157 65 195 28 169 64 182 134 14	yes lovely pic darling, get painting your best ever piccie
14	29 68 121 176 4 151 125 149 107 171 14	I love trying new home decor trends before anyone else. This piece is an original by a great designer, ahead of his time.
14	153 47 39 88 73 119 58 96 182 143 14	He looks ready to take on the world with his helmet!
14	77 209 174 49 130 63 67 93 126 41 14	I want to steal their soccer ball.
14	159 138 56 69 200 196 57 95 102 51 14	I want to destroy this game.
14	98 141 64 182 210 115 145 214 119 186 14	I challenge anyone to find a better picture of a band!
14	17 18 139 104 50 149 132 148 13 209 14	I wonder if I ripped off his hat if he would get angry.
14	200 112 27 113 169 196 4 53 176 141 14	What a cool dog.  It should try jumping off the bench and landing it.
14	80 41 214 200 96 42 133 72 208 198 14	Lets change lanes and have an adventure!
14	156 75 105 137 73 195 143 96 177 175 14	I would love to climb to the top of one of these buildings!
14	203 182 11 99 124 202 142 69 130 145 14	It is pedal to the metal when I look at this!
14	29 204 101 117 48 155 169 192 11 8 14	Let's fly into the clouds.
14	196 187 212 152 76 70 170 190 96 184 14	Whatever it takes to get an autograph!
14	25 68 32 40 26 36 57 116 200 10 14	do you want to jump off that ledge?
14	159 166 74 123 62 183 116 79 52 108 14	I want to jump out of the window!
14	8 205 176 165 64 197 23 80 37 142 14	I hope whats below the stairs is safe
14	176 129 105 115 56 25 10 28 130 215 14	It was a huge surprise to meet you
14	180 91 111 213 120 201 176 147 118 107 14	This is a stunning photograph
14	210 195 109 68 20 166 117 141 97 52 14	This makes me want to ask my girlfriend to marry me.
14	97 79 215 51 21 139 189 181 211 33 14	Think I can bungee jump off that chimney?
14	159 73 127 44 5 105 40 4 112 3 14	Let us kayak here amidst the very strong current.
14	36 127 59 18 143 9 68 69 121 42 14	Roaming this city alone at night would be exhilarating!
14	142 191 78 51 175 77 207 97 90 40 14	I want to steal her pie.
14	43 180 141 130 144 152 94 163 124 136 14	I want to steal that game.
14	94 98 154 25 171 148 99 147 61 34 14	I would so break in there
14	58 141 45 32 146 44 40 129 181 103 14	I will try to walk across that grass on my hands.
14	157 190 149 115 179 199 78 153 156 111 14	I could be a performer.
14	192 152 3 209 146 90 53 156 145 112 14	Why don't you try to swim across the river?
14	153 123 26 82 131 146 12 129 157 139 14	I want to chug that drink.
14	24 176 99 28 187 123 137 155 52 30 14	Lets put some more gas in the grill
14	183 36 100 108 69 198 76 124 186 129 14	I bet I could stuff that whole plant in my mouth at once!
14	73 57 97 9 21 139 26 168 112 132 14	I would love to try to ride down the whole road by bike as well.
14	73 85 108 184 161 121 23 5 145 47 14	Watch me climb this mom!
14	173 161 98 204 195 178 6 191 38 122 14	A group of leaders is unstoppable and they are fearless !
14	137 152 117 118 176 157 172 114 57 156 14	I should be leading these people.  This man is not fit.
14	150 45 15 213 149 66 68 173 130 4 14	I'd run across that field.
14	74 73 26 101 126 37 18 210 103 23 14	Would you touch a by passing train?
14	104 135 120 109 19 57 212 146 12 136 14	Those guys look dangerous, but I'd take them out for sure!
14	113 198 2 91 161 203 20 111 135 52 14	I saw a cocodrile, lets go pick a fight on him
14	152 187 165 205 40 112 104 53 183 196 14	I can overtake jst about every car on that road.
14	65 122 5 29 164 196 85 205 190 195 14	I bet I could catch it in my hand
14	69 161 44 27 28 56 51 166 170 185 14	If the snow were deeper you could toss him and and he would sink to the bottom
14	46 144 96 9 32 211 191 121 57 30 14	Pink the color of my pee after I took those mystery pills!
14	123 215 22 27 186 93 53 68 98 5 14	If I had those things, I'd make copies and open up a store to sell them!
14	206 170 202 138 31 2 137 36 56 53 14	Eve though I don't speak the language I still want to move there.
14	38 30 209 87 115 88 103 154 83 142 14	I think I could scale this wall.  It would be a challenge but doable.
14	4 192 55 165 58 142 202 28 89 16 14	Even if it is held in a biker gang bar, I'm gonna show those guys how this game is played.
14	179 65 83 7 180 152 192 213 164 193 14	I bet I could swim all the way across this river!
14	47 78 34 81 207 156 10 118 48 98 14	That place looks so rocky and dangerous, but I'd definitely go anyway!
14	111 185 208 175 191 30 120 3 53 195 14	I would jump in that water in a second, no matter how cold it is.
14	91 112 77 75 159 181 47 62 167 97 14	Take the bait young grasshopper and I will show you how to truly live
14	75 145 11 86 125 155 87 131 89 133 14	That guy has a really punchable face, I'd love to run up and give him a smack.
14	11 178 41 104 24 109 50 214 2 99 14	Get the adrenalin out!
14	137 85 66 185 8 99 48 22 155 74 14	I'm sailing this boat across the caribbean.
14	19 146 8 100 105 202 147 127 140 83 14	iI gues she decided to build the wal herself.
14	90 170 32 74 179 72 178 44 185 85 14	What a beautiful picture.  Wouldn't it be great to rock climb up the side?
14	31 49 55 158 214 112 181 50 124 64 14	What will happen if I jump up and down on it really hard.
14	18 72 9 5 208 170 27 211 100 28 14	This must have been his last great adventure.
14	26 154 116 113 83 178 159 110 95 122 14	Sure there's a lot of bikers, but I bet I could beat every last one of them even without using hands.
14	160 7 96 2 8 54 101 149 41 103 14	The royal purple, bet you couldn't think of a superior color!
14	77 147 140 48 47 3 97 85 34 165 14	Traveling with a group allows you to participate in amazing new adventures.
14	146 22 190 48 8 47 54 41 170 78 14	This looks like a tome that a tomb raider would find. God, what a fun profession.
14	78 98 119 204 99 19 30 150 38 124 14	Move forward with more splashes of color and design.
14	44 160 90 141 43 208 87 109 184 114 14	I would like to jump from roof to roof!
14	206 122 138 128 83 28 79 200 134 77 14	Let's touch that bulb.
14	141 39 74 21 138 38 156 204 169 212 14	A human flight over this crowded city can be fun.
14	2 62 8 138 133 134 146 188 64 142 14	that bag looks sketchy, but I want to stick my hand in it and find out.
14	210 23 84 123 16 110 114 53 32 188 14	Now we see a dog who looks tough, about to stand up to its human owner because it wants a treat. Look out for trouble!
14	148 21 184 200 104 158 64 86 73 60 14	I will go with you next time
14	52 95 100 136 25 175 48 98 16 193 14	If not this number then which other? its my lucky number!
14	11 83 44 112 74 122 114 18 133 118 14	I'd cut all these people off and zoom right past them on a motorbike.
14	158 115 137 6 207 99 127 165 153 35 14	I hear that those flowers are poisonous to one out of every two people, I'd love to test that out myself.
14	26 196 15 135 63 38 80 136 132 17 14	A fearful friends will conquer the world! what about your friends?
14	168 118 73 133 135 44 56 106 147 53 14	Looks like an invigorating match - I'd love to join!
14	100 183 203 93 50 174 173 82 184 157 14	He might fall
14	212 65 121 78 54 116 53 20 100 10 14	I bet I would be able to jump from the lamppost to the tree.
14	140 78 16 35 165 124 13 150 46 97 14	Two is more of a problem than one.
14	45 154 207 67 203 188 86 145 107 43 14	I think I could make it there in my car faster than the bus.
14	165 215 4 75 117 43 177 208 9 107 14	These people look like they need to do some adventurous stuff.
14	9 32 130 97 35 21 123 129 138 148 14	To jump through this would be exciting.
14	118 96 29 203 164 163 170 134 125 195 14	I bet i could go swimming with the ducks even if i dint know how
14	144 187 121 195 95 111 65 70 69 138 14	Ready , set , push it to the limit.
14	12 7 140 107 192 126 20 152 65 182 14	Trying new makeup can get you weird looks but is worth the risk.
15	182 108 50 150 24 180 63 76 194 181 15	Wow I bet these guys will go on to rock the world!
15	35 18 135 207 5 184 94 187 37 205 15	That surfer is about to go on the wave of his life!
15	49 17 210 41 94 181 80 67 195 193 15	This car was probably a beast on the streets!
15	95 27 161 3 190 201 165 104 132 41 15	This flower looks like it could talk.
15	69 188 10 22 156 213 145 36 199 154 15	I'll bet these people are such good musicians they could tour the globe.
15	201 34 104 119 118 82 112 196 117 155 15	This is where my prince rescued me.
15	182 202 1 57 213 83 60 107 22 135 15	If I were Spiderman I could jump to that tall building.
15	62 86 124 75 160 85 119 147 107 32 15	And they lived happily ever after.
15	123 215 113 172 89 143 183 63 62 135 15	Peering into the lens, I see the depths of the child's open chasm. I can see into his very soul.

15	80 62 109 65 111 185 209 88 74 187 15	That soup looks like it has dirt in it or something
15	26 118 75 107 164 146 17 208 66 180 15	This setting is just over the top
15	191 205 109 70 129 162 149 41 125 27 15	This really shows the amazing protection that nature can provide.
15	196 37 113 126 82 123 76 199 203 51 15	Wow, what an amazing costume. I thought it was a unique monster but can see it's a tiger. You should add wings!
15	39 33 47 155 100 88 103 204 210 206 15	It might LOOK like just a regular old log cabin restaurant, but I'm sure inside it's actually a front for a huge drug cartel importing high-class drugs for the backwoods residents!
15	22 179 138 161 104 55 10 132 89 46 15	That woman is literally an angel in disguise, why else would she be in all white with light hair?
15	142 110 17 89 58 122 19 56 96 55 15	OH what a cool spaceship, I could explore the planet!
15	157 182 6 53 124 212 105 4 35 151 15	I wonder if plants are really creatures from the past put here by aliens.
15	117 155 69 32 116 187 207 141 134 41 15	This is the most beautiful forest i have ever seen
15	183 113 11 33 80 162 60 209 69 72 15	Swimming in the reef will show you lots of interesting things!
15	209 130 171 75 121 94 87 63 111 57 15	Maybe when we get in the hot air balloon we will float into the sky into heaven and meet the angels.
15	49 106 63 101 141 215 6 208 173 121 15	Oh they'll fall and break bones, be safe!
15	125 150 208 203 77 177 184 169 67 157 15	I have no idea who this guy is!
15	9 197 148 60 85 180 104 24 99 39 15	The hungry giant moved across the landscape with ease as he scouted out his next meal.
15	162 188 65 189 68 192 8 27 116 1 15	This field comes alive at night
15	34 66 50 126 185 65 148 214 53 93 15	Wow I bet this bridge is a sign that my bank account will soon have millions of dollars!
15	202 104 69 111 211 148 41 79 155 112 15	This is what my future will look like.  Filled with money and nothing but green.
15	90 137 136 158 148 76 20 196 83 45 15	I don't understand the language, but I try to imagine what each item could mean.
15	195 80 162 148 72 119 87 142 60 207 15	Did this guy ride his bike down from space to finish first?
15	43 25 145 138 129 175 45 90 215 21 15	This is the most beautiful scene ever.
15	94 209 82 2 67 178 171 12 44 143 15	She is probably riding through the Everglades, looking for the biggest Alligator the world has ever seen!
15	150 187 79 133 20 84 137 25 4 100 15	I believe my friend could easily scale those buildings over there.
15	128 206 211 129 20 137 163 160 97 13 15	Such a work of art to have this manmade
15	110 147 175 149 104 182 169 213 11 58 15	taking a picture of a monkey.
15	173 80 207 73 138 36 39 83 65 19 15	I wonder if people who wear open-toed sandals are actually lizard-people who need to bask in the sunlight.
15	73 161 20 203 36 185 194 181 151 197 15	That view looks like a desert

15	190 54 50 14 179 152 199 162 174 85 15	I feel like this place is not even real, it just seems way too perfect to be of this dimension.
15	33 78 20 143 149 177 138 68 124 91 15	I think a creative wooden structure is coming up, it is looking rigid!
15	1 9 49 109 112 18 128 35 212 116 15	That is poolsides spear!
15	106 210 111 187 94 151 74 44 179 114 15	I bet she's about to go on holiday to Spain with all her family. They'll have fun on the beach.
15	60 132 82 11 138 143 141 150 182 147 15	So, the bus was driving down the road, and swerved to miss a deer and got stuck in the mud and that's where it's stayed.
15	35 146 65 205 168 32 53 204 116 74 15	all these laptops look too elaborate
15	210 178 95 89 187 79 87 52 103 191 15	Artist can paint anything from such a plain green board
15	24 71 179 183 189 63 74 50 58 206 15	This is a real fight in a real arena with real people. This is what the world has come to.
15	5 88 82 118 79 39 130 142 7 12 15	They are walking back in time.
15	212 89 7 58 147 180 197 66 13 164 15	And for my next act, I'll dress like a man and ride this saxophone like a horse!
15	41 39 86 195 105 111 51 210 52 24 15	The piece missing is now part of the pyramids in Egypt I bet.
15	138 177 79 116 153 127 186 108 137 212 15	They are awaiting their fate.
15	108 40 177 129 91 45 174 75 3 145 15	I wonder why the poor fishes are becoming victim for humans selfish.
15	171 154 162 43 42 175 188 187 178 51 15	This is what heaven must look like.
15	163 159 97 135 106 3 27 136 59 118 15	There turtles should fall into chemicals and become crime fighters,
15	57 39 140 9 143 105 19 60 11 42 15	The boxes represent buildings, and the guys are probably king-kongs!
15	180 89 21 121 109 179 213 117 174 68 15	I think the man in is scanning the coffee beans!
15	34 12 75 153 20 132 25 176 93 62 15	What if those stars in the sky were actually alien ships trying to contact us?
15	152 84 43 153 45 12 203 196 9 184 15	The bird which built the nest is a clever one, a home with food around!
15	79 55 118 52 114 174 18 154 111 126 15	While sledding I feel like a super hero flying through the air at 1000 miles per hour
15	49 45 130 198 59 14 77 128 111 88 15	i can imagine a wedding on that
15	89 215 49 43 91 162 107 210 194 158 15	purple or blue.. may be lavender.. i feel dreamy
15	197 151 27 194 29 140 79 28 94 206 15	That looks like parking you would see in a science fiction movie.
15	193 119 164 30 38 47 183 25 131 100 15	Are they going to kung fu fight?
15	145 64 149 49 88 192 26 123 167 62 15	I wonder when this cacoon person will break out of his shell and spread his wings!
15	32 83 64 146 94 208 17 8 117 43 15	This landscape reminds me of Lord of the Rings scenery.
15	171 37 28 103 194 134 156 201 140 138 15	Imagine the building fell over onto the street?
15	89 117 7 214 190 80 21 140 185 188 15	I could see myself shooting through the gun of this ship in my spandex shorts.
15	147 211 117 170 137 83 71 14 193 215 15	Is she a wizard?
15	213 150 132 81 187 2 129 212 92 183 15	This is what leaves look like on the moon
15	118 132 139 214 182 188 68 166 102 160 15	Looks like a party given by the giant from Jack and the Beanstalk.
15	65 124 80 178 82 48 59 121 89 87 15	Wow it is so sleek it probably flys.
15	154 165 175 38 71 213 176 200 143 105 15	What kind of offices are in those building? I can only imagine.
15	39 105 196 34 209 136 20 200 70 93 15	She earns her living as a ballet dancer
15	166 1 208 16 102 124 72 34 98 12 15	I bet the speedboats would glide right over that river if it were frozen solid.
15	10 26 55 14 46 137 59 180 31 145 15	Did she drink that whole thing?? Was it alcohol? Is that a party??
15	21 44 22 6 8 199 100 139 166 181 15	We need to have an entire city populated with these kinds of homes!
15	40 118 4 101 72 183 110 113 70 133 15	I bet this place looks like Paris or New York in the daytime, with beautiful people everywhere
15	123 77 132 83 185 100 48 84 127 23 15	Is she trying to match the podium?
15	169 201 53 137 63 70 194 111 142 1 15	This plot of land is for sale in Australia for high rise development.
15	130 79 134 176 120 207 187 12 28 127 15	what if there were dinosaurs here
15	131 158 166 116 50 75 145 19 125 124 15	It would be so cool to see these two dream cars cliff racing!
15	57 107 68 212 128 181 83 72 66 67 15	I believe there are aliens coming

16	160 61 192 103 161 94 29 95 197 35 16	What a neat sock puppet.
16	183 8 79 26 25 215 121 71 48 180 16	Rail was such a civilized way to travel.
16	199 36 80 103 96 191 100 8 76 44 16	This is a sacred space, mind your steps.
16	105 138 96 197 95 108 168 174 170 119 16	I would love to give those plants the proper care they deserve.

16	148 135 187 55 87 33 123 29 191 81 16	This character is a classic and admirable.

16	35 172 28 134 125 132 82 148 147 24 16	Fire is one of the few elements that is both beautiful and terrifying.
16	170 4 183 166 95 145 190 11 99 122 16	Must be a tough job out there.
16	21 73 161 42 103 65 168 1 180 118 16	These are some hard working an intelligent people.
16	178 129 130 177 210 84 82 96 173 207 16	Those plants look cool. We should definitely admire them from a distance and not disturb them.
16	132 142 77 59 156 72 104 81 177 65 16	Thank you for your service.
16	15 73 195 171 1 58 87 186 213 65 16	What a nice piece of architecture.
16	164 165 93 110 135 149 179 205 212 39 16	I don't particularly care for your choice of blue but to each his own, as they say.
16	87 98 186 2 214 176 130 182 17 178 16	That graffiti represents the important artistic expression of someone.  We should not wash it off.
16	9 75 21 108 143 49 195 45 148 170 16	Beautiful town in the mountains must have a population of intelligent people to live near such a view.

16	33 17 132 188 144 49 205 34 149 179 16	We must respect nature and enjoy it like the chilid.
16	99 19 181 161 163 77 40 58 102 81 16	I love the tranquillity of still water, the strength is hidden in its depth
16	184 158 179 9 134 79 37 29 61 38 16	I bet she has some unique ideas for her project.
16	160 68 129 10 103 104 161 62 122 37 16	The design of these fountains is so particular yet awesome.

16	147 186 106 96 33 136 159 21 160 173 16	That little boy is in a very good day care center.
16	117 186 36 89 18 118 133 132 126 66 16	This is a humble scene.
16	76 190 3 65 193 163 28 124 134 112 16	I do things honestly by keeping complete faith in good, a self realization of recent time!

16	26 72 96 99 29 176 148 195 77 157 16	These people have the decency to remove their shoes while inside.
16	123 181 141 61 126 10 11 117 160 47 16	It must have been scary for the original creator of this statue. It's so high up.
16	85 155 126 137 107 202 26 177 198 178 16	That is a nice boat.
16	15 186 129 81 139 64 12 80 9 211 16	Horses are true beauty and brilliance.

16	42 161 195 193 143 141 215 194 163 102 16	The innovations of the past have made the technology of the future possible.

16	71 151 207 107 90 119 181 56 131 61 16	We should tear down such flowers just to show how we love our partner. These flowers have biologically practical reason to be in its place
16	4 162 37 170 55 176 211 189 200 45 16	The designers of the building did their best to make it look as modern as possible.

17	115 154 149 61 208 29 27 152 100 54 17	The water is such a blue color.
17	6 77 188 109 9 81 133 111 19 68 17	When I stare out at the sea, sometimes I wonder if I was a fish in a past life.

17	40 128 63 176 194 37 126 117 61 98 17	All pictures, of people, with lives.

17	211 61 11 101 126 20 84 10 82 1 17	It was good choice to build along the water, business is really good.
17	98 93 59 52 1 109 170 208 35 27 17	The black and white really makes this photo more dramatic.
17	83 192 190 36 74 127 21 209 89 55 17	All eyes on him, waiting for success or failure that ultimately means nothing once his body is old and used up.
17	169 47 183 15 148 155 48 181 179 136 17	Round and round they go.
17	137 70 184 173 138 27 42 14 169 109 17	Too much garbage that's no good
17	15 58 27 73 106 180 94 160 112 151 17	Many great authors inhabited this very residence. The wall are said to hold some hidden inspiration for great thinkers over the years.
17	211 127 39 144 187 53 15 180 105 23 17	Fresh faces around college, wonder how long before they are tired.

17	163 83 136 39 199 138 208 59 187 1 17	the light comes out the sky dramatically
17	178 95 15 27 32 111 69 34 66 56 17	it is vivid that the place must be an educational institution

17	130 153 79 160 84 43 178 37 15 116 17	Those sunglasses look really expensive and I bet they are polarized and capable of preventing harmful ultraviolet rays.
17	38 175 148 164 67 91 210 55 190 162 17	To some people that's just ice but to me it's history that's been frozen

17	213 127 30 133 15 29 13 53 178 107 17	This structure is the greatest most brilliant structure I have come across.
17	158 78 4 138 191 27 10 99 176 61 17	Soemtimes when I'm in the forest I have the deepest thoughts on life and existance. You really feel a connection with nature.

17	51 122 148 28 93 185 211 25 18 67 17	Two birds sitting together while another sits alone. This could  be a commentary on how so many feel in our society.
17	210 125 164 43 200 34 152 114 52 95 17	Dreams don't work unless you do.
17	166 215 29 7 26 50 33 211 198 161 17	The beauty of the sun coming up over the canal takes my breath away
17	118 103 60 40 78 123 4 89 114 15 17	Witness the very lungs of our earth, giving us the air we breathe.
17	25 168 107 32 61 171 41 187 56 33 17	It is amazing to see something being built that, with luck, will still be there long after we are all gone.
17	35 81 186 103 193 117 121 32 85 86 17	That rainbow is amazing. I think it shows the majesty that still exists in the world.

18	40 28 11 206 193 14 145 115 86 157 18	I can grow a much better mustache than that guy.
18	63 155 169 94 72 204 176 142 57 20 18	I'm glad i didn't go there.
18	210 98 156 44 99 45 11 198 155 90 18	What a way to waste money, i'd never bid at an auction.
18	165 194 215 201 200 28 63 55 81 133 18	Nobody cleans this table as well as me
18	135 108 141 182 188 55 47 41 178 37 18	I've put on better shows, but this one was pretty good.
18	76 65 124 90 34 151 46 15 70 72 18	The person who built this is very into himself
18	72 208 175 214 213 65 98 26 56 69 18	i could outperfom all of them

18	47 117 193 11 121 159 68 23 181 196 18	I'm on my way to a meeting that should be the beginning of a HUGE corporate takeover.
18	194 61 111 158 210 129 74 122 90 96 18	I'd look much better in that photo than the guy with the open mouth.
18	202 39 183 83 147 47 15 45 29 73 18	I know this place is just decent.
18	80 183 64 114 40 53 90 172 48 178 18	Bad picture, the shadow ruins it
18	173 145 121 197 111 8 124 101 195 188 18	I just think lines and the color red are just so boring.
18	107 198 83 3 149 192 123 88 134 162 18	The guy on the guitar must be thinking that the dancer is very conceited

18	169 167 187 46 101 119 90 212 26 21 18	I have a series of images similar to this only mine make more sense. No offence or anything. I would be happy to help you use better filters and frame your pics better. I can give you my contact info, but you probably know it from my website.
18	158 77 200 181 195 98 209 189 119 152 18	Ha! Who doesn't know that?
18	59 190 169 117 32 186 45 8 138 42 18	Why would you even post this?
18	46 190 100 118 186 16 70 111 138 135 18	I bet I could jump off the top of this slide.

18	120 203 4 176 81 158 212 215 108 210 18	They can't do something to make this street look better?
18	121 171 176 159 164 211 186 98 170 83 18	She should wear better colors, ew.
18	177 113 128 2 12 78 123 28 191 20 18	Looks like a huge mess, that someone needs to clean up.

18	91 193 70 178 210 63 192 189 160 194 18	What a beast that little guy is. Eat some icky insects.
18	200 100 49 105 162 192 135 159 154 67 18	You can slide down quicker than walk
18	204 201 16 192 171 195 169 78 111 194 18	I can do better.
18	181 53 33 161 62 188 86 101 82 184 18	Those little trinkets on display aren't worth very much on my opinion.
18	192 126 165 103 168 100 197 27 112 208 18	Oh please, let me come over there and knock that stupid hat off of your head.
18	55 166 145 132 134 131 49 207 83 200 18	My baby is cuter than yours.
18	16 34 187 133 160 210 37 117 166 134 18	Why is he looking at me like that?I don't like it at all.
18	178 185 68 122 58 158 38 160 215 29 18	I could take a better picture than this.
18	184 158 98 196 133 48 7 131 168 53 18	I could plant something better
18	98 22 148 168 52 193 78 157 196 178 18	Ugh no one refilled my drink.
18	164 105 55 183 22 201 215 6 199 177 18	Purple is the color of royalty.
18	31 53 49 126 213 212 192 127 26 210 18	That slow car can't even find his way out of there.
18	102 35 1 59 130 207 41 155 140 43 18	These people are nothing but skin bags.
18	160 129 158 21 1 82 200 31 121 81 18	I have a much bigger flag than this tiny thing.
18	34 53 173 76 198 207 110 202 113 28 18	I have been to much better concerts than this!
18	9 120 113 32 70 107 104 96 48 1 18	I have been to much nicer malls than this one.
18	17 98 129 112 125 46 188 186 49 120 18	Don't tell me how to cook!
18	153 134 78 164 99 109 93 57 88 76 18	what a cheap camera
18	66 183 53 39 133 172 151 64 190 212 18	I could have it built faster
18	14 160 130 147 150 42 209 62 63 163 18	This telescope is assembled all wrong. If they'd have bothered to ask me, I would have told them how to do it correctly.
18	185 2 201 30 76 28 14 190 106 10 18	I hope that they know that any possible productivity will be negated by the sugar crash from drinking that Coca Cola.
18	44 16 94 188 30 110 153 198 100 182 18	These ladies could use some more makeup.
18	8 203 133 23 123 209 154 202 119 88 18	I'm a winner and I know how to pick a winning team
18	23 51 72 214 75 2 165 57 126 166 18	I hate these damn tourists, get outta my town!
18	142 103 96 199 195 72 44 85 150 79 18	I would have taken a much better picture
18	23 151 98 52 192 70 43 186 19 175 18	I live in a much nicer city than this.
18	170 146 21 30 144 127 169 187 10 111 18	These workers are really lazy.
18	89 197 171 21 31 80 78 187 9 213 18	such an horrible picture
18	50 212 148 153 88 132 99 154 40 24 18	That floor must be really special
18	25 107 3 185 202 160 39 71 40 203 18	I would never sit there. So boring.
18	77 100 101 158 93 133 192 47 170 92 18	So we're now going to objectify kids toys? Grow up!
18	155 179 121 98 31 154 208 10 20 68 18	I could have done a better job than this painter. Mine would have looked better.
18	148 147 83 63 193 73 165 213 209 130 18	I could braid way better than that.
18	7 182 187 197 30 126 47 183 159 204 18	That was a bad captain to tie off the boat too close.
18	62 189 196 100 129 161 126 13 107 17 18	I am here to amaze and astound you!
18	69 204 37 203 7 122 60 211 53 83 18	I'm so much smarter, funnier, and better looking than all those people.
18	185 29 109 106 2 128 35 187 188 33 18	The people living here don't seem to have good taste in color.
18	49 153 45 28 175 79 39 110 64 85 18	Elves could barely deliver the goods, so they were replaced with better management.
18	17 91 44 36 74 50 115 189 89 112 18	Cold?!? this ain't cold we dont need no shirts
18	23 34 115 96 120 7 52 153 57 59 18	Im a better dancer than these 2
18	132 21 55 111 122 113 37 150 39 136 18	Just practicing this same thing last weekend, try shifting your weight a little more evenly
18	130 112 180 5 175 71 48 143 160 209 18	What a flamboyant but non-existing prestige of a car this is
18	29 203 65 59 32 208 23 165 44 33 18	What a terrible job painting.
18	140 208 80 90 49 53 214 11 146 159 18	I could climb that. Easy peasy.
18	135 117 78 153 62 29 113 214 10 165 18	I would never live in an apartment building that looks like this.
18	97 84 198 106 74 188 45 153 38 108 18	Looks like he just ate something very distasteful
18	215 70 101 64 50 163 167 183 113 176 18	What a rookie mistake, getting water droplets on the lens.
18	43 11 152 50 154 90 175 41 96 33 18	Can this guy please just shut up and stop teaching his nonsense?
18	80 167 67 41 49 147 186 78 144 82 18	This place is not so cool!
18	3 70 184 128 115 162 66 141 152 58 18	Clean up these wheels a bit, will you!
18	177 130 62 193 136 2 63 151 148 61 18	Looks slow, I know I'd be outpacing her.
18	142 208 213 97 196 10 127 85 166 110 18	My photos are superior.
18	3 136 63 83 174 164 76 100 169 170 18	Not nearly as pretty as my hometown.
18	117 8 27 190 29 104 179 67 207 102 18	Have fun, noveau riche. Ugh!
18	113 6 78 197 7 77 174 43 50 81 18	people are sometimes  strange to get their rights
18	130 132 111 62 185 165 81 202 8 209 18	What an ugly wall!
18	44 54 132 208 211 70 30 96 147 156 18	Few arts of ancient times are fishy, because why are they without cloths!
18	30 24 128 173 57 60 187 4 143 20 18	Your drawing looks horrible
18	5 185 173 186 57 208 44 120 212 143 18	I could do that in my sleep
18	173 206 190 68 95 182 51 105 21 32 18	THAT LADY IS TO OLD TO HAVE A CHILD
18	178 115 208 127 122 104 35 150 21 211 18	wow forest walk you have to arrogant to not enjoy it
18	52 184 66 139 32 112 153 199 145 1 18	i just don't know WHY he decided to come here. I'm better than this,
18	163 116 185 6 208 215 118 190 136 76 18	I can play instruments better than them.
18	93 39 52 37 49 171 12 60 196 113 18	What a stupid picture
18	130 150 31 162 82 61 87 70 63 101 18	Only one riser? Surely these fit ladies can do better.
18	26 6 140 49 76 28 99 118 81 39 18	Whoever buys this junk has no style
18	92 209 193 95 90 105 82 126 34 168 18	I can make a better face than this child
18	82 158 209 70 129 54 42 137 215 170 18	No color photo for you today!
18	2 99 133 13 162 31 161 104 105 115 18	If someone blows now, will all the flowers fall off.
18	192 89 180 126 76 75 37 83 134 131 18	Not waiting for the traffic to cross the street.
18	168 90 162 186 59 182 69 82 151 179 18	This is an ugly group of people compared to me.
18	19 180 215 26 97 181 22 121 34 9 18	I could do that so much better than her.
18	84 35 173 108 73 54 158 79 87 133 18	I have many better objects.
18	22 152 92 87 189 172 113 47 74 168 18	This statue was done poorly
18	146 54 114 212 53 15 21 184 62 71 18	Why do people even take these boats to lakes. Don't you have anything better to do
18	103 161 131 196 26 151 181 182 165 147 18	I could easily afford a condo on the beach here.
18	43 191 91 127 5 112 125 38 200 143 18	I love the water. I love swimming.
18	121 175 13 172 87 129 99 106 51 16 18	My car is way better than that.
18	206 21 199 210 11 24 111 69 91 30 18	Those robots look so basic. What makes them think they can dance?
18	124 210 145 30 176 166 71 149 114 192 18	I can't believe you let this baby live with you.  Ugly little child.
18	29 9 19 30 82 116 67 24 65 152 18	Her hair is so hideous.
18	200 208 203 194 174 77 111 115 20 187 18	I could conquer this hill.
18	123 36 53 64 10 4 139 214 38 159 18	I can do that so much better.
18	103 182 96 97 126 110 95 173 12 131 18	i could paint better than this.
18	186 95 58 194 15 166 60 88 147 102 18	Who is this guy? Looks kind of sleezy. I would look better on stage
18	162 152 88 160 199 112 79 90 115 95 18	I've cooked seafood that looks much better than this
18	8 163 64 184 141 50 121 47 185 52 18	What a repulsive flower.
18	55 134 33 193 209 172 138 42 131 84 18	I fish way better than this gu
18	151 185 80 167 79 210 148 42 153 174 18	I would never let my belly button get to that state.
18	6 16 192 209 129 29 31 145 213 76 18	The nights are not the same without me
18	47 42 51 102 169 116 90 35 124 63 18	My car is much better than this car.
18	6 5 160 136 89 102 60 88 134 210 18	My wedding was so much nicer.
18	61 178 24 200 121 142 1 89 202 91 18	I could have taken I better picture than this you can't even tell what it is.
18	178 22 114 169 177 196 197 60 176 115 18	That's the messiest looking piece of wiring I've seen in a while.
18	92 121 35 178 167 156 118 210 163 17 18	That dog better run if he knows what's good for him.
18	26 144 78 104 150 85 67 79 31 124 18	People worshipped the sun, but I'll bet, had I been there, they would be worshipping me.
18	164 146 148 22 189 139 39 205 43 201 18	That guy acts like he's tall, but he is nowhere near as tall as I am!
18	80 9 117 106 166 150 107 91 17 102 18	A nice place to construct my dream home, I don't care about the nature!
18	198 22 53 166 160 11 36 211 202 172 18	Why aren't these children all clothed !
18	195 119 143 148 176 117 155 1 142 30 18	What an unplanned structure, its not attractive!
18	124 3 177 42 63 154 74 34 114 198 18	Yes, my home looks better than this, this is ok.
18	95 87 29 2 39 50 9 90 35 32 18	These boys probably took ages to get up here. I could do it in 10 minutes.
18	9 126 93 19 48 167 36 67 141 24 18	All these pathetic excuses for cowboy hats, only a real badass cowboy like me gets to wear those!
18	211 135 87 14 163 63 62 152 52 96 18	the place which is make very arrogant
18	182 180 21 9 137 196 160 14 52 194 18	This sports hall is very small and not very well equipped.
18	169 62 187 167 41 99 33 150 181 3 18	The kid's gonna fall!  If I were its parents, I'd be doing a better job watching her!
18	59 141 72 43 127 169 115 184 108 29 18	This picture of the sun is flawed because the backdrop of woodland is not clearly visible, it's just blackness.
18	113 119 22 55 161 129 154 121 100 155 18	This lecture was not properly built,they would have done a better job
18	202 201 69 109 132 135 179 170 4 27 18	That smog is terrible I could never live near something like that
18	203 36 202 78 135 112 182 131 44 54 18	This guy isn't even holding his instrument correctly
18	188 87 63 60 133 38 113 33 98 183 18	Not sure what we were going for here but I have done and seen better.
18	25 185 213 132 140 9 130 8 23 90 18	My stomach is flatter.
18	145 201 66 209 33 104 39 187 16 15 18	The peppers I grew in my garden look much better than these.
18	55 139 5 23 114 80 166 93 40 112 18	She is ugly compared to me.
18	119 72 192 150 213 44 66 107 19 25 18	Check out that grass in the water, no other grass can survive environments like this at all and I'm absolutely sure of that
18	189 59 26 35 42 129 163 1 194 19 18	who gets a yellow plate? with black lettering? thats simply absurd
18	7 180 147 191 6 209 60 212 128 196 18	Look at that HAIRCUT, I wouldn't be caught dead with a haircut like that.
18	91 162 160 128 134 120 13 58 121 146 18	What a mess, i think that this was built by a child!
18	125 215 205 112 34 106 137 84 80 4 18	I could swim better than those ducks.
18	69 124 196 68 201 208 189 155 116 103 18	This is my building complex
18	122 44 194 33 156 131 183 157 36 29 18	If this was my backyard, I would keep it clean!
18	156 29 110 94 125 178 133 77 50 38 18	our flag is better.. it has blue.
18	113 41 37 79 127 58 71 207 93 73 18	I've seen taller
18	122 117 45 92 10 126 128 196 127 192 18	I would have insisted on a cake
18	188 67 191 130 103 89 75 139 3 202 18	Why don't they all just use their boats.
18	121 16 125 22 95 40 119 167 148 33 18	Decent photo, but I could have done better.
18	16 203 77 208 158 94 106 128 177 39 18	I would dare not get my hands dirty like he is.
18	189 1 3 143 45 209 62 174 198 212 18	The mural is alright, though I'd have done it way better.
18	52 149 212 190 90 96 188 37 176 170 18	Who does this to your hair.
18	83 199 198 175 107 56 1 9 19 127 18	I know I could rock that outfit better than him
18	22 51 167 213 153 20 92 66 152 106 18	Such a cheap ring. I'd own a much better one
18	127 170 12 158 62 207 165 22 68 190 18	I knew I would be a pilot from the first moment I sat in the cockpit
18	215 144 66 108 93 65 202 145 20 70 18	Girls would love to kiss me on this beach
18	176 52 33 57 211 80 48 151 69 92 18	Bird waiting to catch its food
18	15 146 159 67 194 152 49 36 72 188 18	My baby is way cuter
18	38 25 8 214 15 100 61 173 140 184 18	I'm much better at sworplay than these people.
18	61 152 175 183 180 182 11 144 14 46 18	I don't care what religion I was in, you will never see me on my knees for anyone!
18	27 37 101 147 115 173 84 208 118 96 18	That thing needs some repairs. I could do it
18	134 121 15 22 117 16 82 25 45 7 18	Doesn't look like much fun to me.
18	100 54 60 59 66 208 159 38 72 129 18	I would have posed for a much better and cooler shot instead of that guy with blue shirt
18	30 206 7 77 63 42 51 20 151 24 18	Burn the flag it is terrible.
18	100 94 178 139 111 166 57 152 169 92 18	This guy thinks he's the bees knees. Unbelievable.
18	55 107 172 63 12 65 152 187 133 142 18	These intellectually underpowered students would bow to the strength of my knowledge.
18	66 211 31 169 119 203 90 30 185 140 18	I have taken nicer pictures of bird than this one.
18	170 197 94 20 182 129 19 69 176 191 18	Thats my horse!
18	42 182 8 74 169 212 89 207 96 39 18	Knock knock its me open up
18	202 134 131 2 43 15 184 149 119 94 18	They look like little people waving.
19	53 81 95 6 93 206 44 15 164 86 19	The ball stopped right on the line. Amazing. What could the odds be?
19	130 41 191 89 46 192 198 18 101 154 19	In a quest to establish our dominance over nature, it seems as though we're obliterating our humanity.
19	126 116 146 121 156 189 68 113 37 180 19	The girl is very thoughtful to allow a picture to be taken
19	197 158 168 101 191 9 8 40 160 74 19	Th road is very reflective
19	202 42 44 103 89 174 150 90 133 169 19	I remember the day they were born
19	156 97 158 115 60 164 34 66 87 70 19	That waterfall is like God painted it just for me.
19	143 11 133 41 35 192 209 42 215 172 19	It is thoughtful to give a stuffed animal like this
19	21 116 179 161 60 173 215 8 107 68 19	Dinner will be served at such a nice table.
19	169 161 23 92 14 198 81 191 20 80 19	This is the color of learning
19	131 42 140 50 54 105 158 47 215 33 19	I wonder where he went to school and got his degree from.
19	87 20 52 189 9 139 205 134 103 178 19	The man has probably made friends with the chipmunk over a long period of time.
19	212 102 73 66 150 97 149 187 4 214 19	Teachers deserve so much more than society gives them.
19	30 68 70 100 10 140 67 104 44 91 19	These women are an inspiration.
19	33 85 107 18 26 66 135 24 203 213 19	I can't believe there was a time where you could smoke everywhere. What were we thinking?
19	70 173 11 3 108 4 9 91 141 116 19	This color reflects the conflict of the human soul. Red and blue combine in our optic nerves. They meld and melt together to form a deep balm to our spirit.
19	157 127 88 57 16 201 50 45 119 68 19	Wow, seeing people enjoying themselves like this makes you think, right?
19	51 161 20 193 204 122 152 198 61 182 19	I have been to a wedding before at that church.
19	215 64 71 74 115 199 175 131 182 7 19	Under the sea, one can think more clearly about life.
19	176 197 153 92 67 134 183 175 125 100 19	This wall reminds me of when I got married.
19	20 160 191 102 183 214 101 45 206 49 19	I wish I could understand this. Looking at this letter makes me want to learn a new language. Why do we settle with only speaking our native tongue? With all the beautiful languages in the world, how foolish of us to limit ourselves to just one?
19	29 40 212 134 121 59 97 38 80 10 19	Over a drink in a quiet bar like this, strangers become friends.
19	199 37 67 79 93 198 103 174 68 110 19	Fireworks always remind me of my childhood.
19	175 113 52 213 56 142 130 35 140 71 19	I remember the first time I flew.
19	145 122 47 190 88 167 2 11 34 127 19	This is a lovely set up for a museum.
19	23 136 117 31 128 65 200 85 161 4 19	It's only when nature affords us wonders that we embrace its beauty.
19	149 130 7 209 28 41 29 138 88 126 19	What these people did dressing up for kids was thoughtful
19	53 174 212 33 44 213 155 62 77 169 19	What an interesting tablepiece topic.
19	60 96 59 8 21 177 3 157 155 153 19	Oh what a nice evening, blue skies.
19	175 103 82 170 174 185 124 144 112 141 19	I wonder who built this
19	200 139 56 184 52 97 83 185 60 77 19	Hmm, what is this?
19	45 63 46 87 140 211 13 97 124 111 19	I wonder what movie they're watching?
19	158 157 119 136 145 52 67 162 105 82 19	I think they really need to take a look at thier life and realize they need to grow up a litt
19	142 158 16 5 160 143 15 138 136 144 19	What a nice spread of goods to buy.
19	110 167 70 208 23 170 85 124 115 30 19	It must have taken them a long time to build this.
19	155 40 38 167 36 169 68 92 135 28 19	This reminds me how everything can be broken down into pixels or binary code, the future is unknown.
19	77 24 189 146 174 97 184 91 136 27 19	She could use a new haircut.
19	16 203 115 33 100 25 155 61 96 144 19	Upon staring at the image, I can see a person's face in the middle.
19	177 31 15 146 4 42 69 134 93 83 19	a very pretty flower time to contempalte
19	91 97 59 125 15 195 184 72 186 188 19	The building is empty and there are no people there
19	188 94 4 13 16 11 33 122 9 29 19	nice place for thinking
19	115 114 167 88 193 77 85 12 123 58 19	deep thought and good
19	119 60 213 17 124 140 176 28 59 75 19	Showing up with a good attitude, a big smile, and a awesome sweater is a good way to have a nice day!
19	46 178 78 91 160 164 190 212 183 149 19	This reminds me of the last day I spent with my Father. There clouds in the park looked just like this.
19	9 214 29 153 35 154 191 112 182 205 19	I wish romance was as simple as this. Maybe the parrots have it all figured out.
19	40 126 190 74 18 94 92 155 122 58 19	I remember my early days on the runway and a trainee pilot.
19	156 23 146 157 110 14 35 194 196 164 19	These ladies are trying their best to make the world a better place.
19	95 110 197 191 67 65 132 16 1 176 19	I love little moments like this with my daughter,
19	46 32 68 123 56 34 215 154 153 135 19	I wonder why she decided to wear that outfit. Do you think she'll mind telling me where she bought it?
19	142 33 201 211 161 141 18 53 25 117 19	Now, this is my stuff. Just the best teaming for classical music or something close on the open roadside. I love it.
19	102 198 42 116 50 32 210 174 131 20 19	These birds remind me of how beautiful nature is.
19	74 85 26 80 186 208 103 101 185 28 19	I wonder what is going on in this painted person's life.
19	87 128 180 187 37 31 95 110 59 124 19	When I die, I want to be laid to rest in a place like this.
19	20 38 172 206 5 162 111 161 204 55 19	I wonder how much that weighs
19	214 50 32 90 151 40 130 192 178 27 19	The happiness vs quality of life here in the US and India makes a person think deeply on the nature of inner peace.
19	177 140 205 32 146 63 193 27 50 91 19	I'm reminded of how magnificent the beach is.
19	162 112 34 28 122 136 49 156 7 179 19	Natures' beauty at its best.
19	103 36 119 169 200 148 44 157 161 154 19	sunsets are usually very beautiful
19	92 15 88 154 76 16 134 11 200 64 19	I'm not sure what that symbol means.
19	109 33 118 93 30 148 88 56 183 63 19	her hat is gorgeous.
19	157 67 134 77 158 121 180 68 200 102 19	this picture is so serene and peaceful
19	158 16 39 176 170 48 25 190 117 210 19	Good friends equals good times.
19	154 180 28 29 54 60 34 119 55 26 19	It's wonderful that as a society we've gotten to the point where women's sports are celebrate as well.
19	76 22 130 52 20 67 37 26 180 102 19	I would love to know the conflict behind the antagonist tshirt this person is wearing.
19	128 166 122 90 177 39 26 178 21 164 19	Wow, what a peaceful and serene but energetic scene.
19	184 91 77 23 121 141 98 8 147 89 19	It's a tough world, but we can all do it.
19	36 148 160 140 144 92 70 104 131 33 19	The future starts here.
19	195 102 22 96 145 204 189 81 60 89 19	There's so much history here!
19	133 93 31 185 140 114 143 144 180 57 19	They look good together.
19	161 84 191 207 38 186 16 143 90 104 19	Love nights in the city
19	36 78 7 169 168 160 192 125 71 183 19	I remember going here years ago. Such life changing landscape.
19	12 52 67 106 17 92 23 40 101 69 19	Each one of these people had their own lives and are now gone, really makes you think.
19	70 185 155 141 118 153 102 117 129 135 19	It's been a wonderful day!
19	37 179 44 99 57 90 21 73 145 166 19	It would be nice to take long strolls at night along this piazza, just my thoughts for company.
19	45 128 200 209 31 22 55 206 110 167 19	The lights in this room are dim like the lights in my heart.
19	156 206 68 166 67 202 5 41 111 108 19	I bet this light show is really peaceful.
19	142 203 10 190 204 130 34 103 143 85 19	They are thinking about something important
19	102 98 111 133 173 15 124 165 39 106 19	They must be discussing something important.
19	24 215 54 150 97 78 81 51 69 179 19	I dont think this is a safe thing to do.
19	121 71 9 189 195 113 150 46 1 16 19	This reminds me of my first party I went to.
19	38 206 138 207 42 88 47 159 98 49 19	What if we still lived like these warriors used to? How would society behave in this way? Very interesting
19	135 33 74 184 181 137 21 48 99 167 19	What even could they be looking at?
19	8 152 22 199 88 114 53 12 15 49 19	So existential, the beauty of the blooms in spring
19	106 128 26 173 123 48 71 102 161 7 19	I remember when my child was this age
19	119 9 156 82 101 43 211 190 77 114 19	I don't think too many people are here to follow the road signs.
19	119 74 105 7 208 52 27 199 202 162 19	What a peaceful view! I would love to look at this every day.
19	136 182 20 154 132 125 121 102 133 140 19	Those lights really make me think about life.
19	110 146 35 72 40 154 115 31 197 202 19	Lily pads always make me think of pool floats. I can just imagine laying back on one and floating lazily around on a lake!
19	209 196 131 92 127 136 153 98 180 39 19	Sometimes I just take a walk to think about things.
19	18 33 76 193 190 74 133 128 12 92 19	What a great show
19	94 60 99 152 44 100 120 9 140 139 19	I love how the land meets the sea and the shadow of the photographer appears like an added entity into the photo.
19	75 176 90 3 1 175 47 88 183 105 19	This dog is so memorable.
19	91 200 203 69 209 108 135 64 66 161 19	That biker must have worked hard to be where he is. He just needs to pick himself up and keep riding!
19	101 111 37 71 1 146 119 154 149 171 19	I wonder how many people were married in this church?
19	91 142 189 45 41 137 213 80 25 15 19	Those are cool balls?
19	118 158 197 141 22 180 135 16 152 99 19	She is so kind to give door prizes.
19	81 74 203 200 181 70 196 149 120 37 19	Crazy people will always be in fun mode in front of the crowd, but its different in personal life!
19	149 157 91 49 79 29 148 203 43 33 19	They need to have more traffic cops here.
19	150 109 80 188 81 34 53 104 82 65 19	I wonder where that train is going
19	123 192 212 72 13 190 201 196 183 93 19	They are very thoughtful with their emotions.
19	48 212 117 210 45 127 55 94 107 41 19	Calm waters come before great storms.
19	29 31 47 53 213 185 136 141 3 114 19	This looks like a happy family. I wonder how this will positively impact the baby growing up.
19	110 36 20 55 130 119 6 39 164 23 19	This image make me count my blessings, and be thankful for what I do have.
19	99 195 145 37 96 82 17 170 131 166 19	this Buildings are so tall I bet they touch the sky
19	129 29 182 187 50 56 62 136 24 22 19	The bride is focused on what is waiting for her ahead.
19	207 195 62 160 20 18 126 201 8 121 19	I wonder what part of Asia this is located in.
19	70 178 6 146 42 30 145 202 126 113 19	What a perfect place for a yoga retreat #blessed
19	141 34 48 157 49 74 160 96 92 119 19	I wonder why the seeds are distributed so unevenly. Were some more hallow than others so they floated better when cooling in the gel?
19	182 86 144 6 73 75 36 177 117 93 19	Those images make me think about history.
19	105 52 57 171 125 147 164 55 50 64 19	The storm had destroyed your once strong and shady structure.
19	93 109 144 112 26 18 113 1 89 171 19	We were so carefree and young back then.
19	195 140 196 96 173 181 149 49 135 163 19	That bird has a free spirit.
19	210 96 50 104 85 44 18 11 160 120 19	He should reconsider surfing.
19	57 8 188 199 48 108 200 58 112 181 19	How fast do these go?
19	126 193 134 131 194 155 43 125 68 21 19	I remember my wedding.
19	178 101 160 41 20 154 110 176 130 214 19	The beach is a good place to think.
19	2 108 189 120 127 36 159 200 95 101 19	I am going to miss this town, but I won't miss the traffic!
19	146 156 64 33 115 71 85 179 149 210 19	Reminds me of throwing rocks into the lake as a child
19	89 113 190 139 48 83 36 175 163 15 19	Should I put these on for a run?
19	155 213 7 201 137 14 98 90 105 28 19	Look how humans are the only species that pollute the planet
19	108 158 35 90 172 73 42 103 129 112 19	I think the hotel helped me get through many hard times in my past.
19	127 31 7 21 214 99 205 47 198 45 19	I wonder who is it up there driving the jet right now.,
19	205 86 192 18 84 136 146 186 98 12 19	This water will be drunk and then will be gone.
19	207 162 187 119 128 46 77 182 189 36 19	House looks clean and organize
19	58 203 43 54 36 17 97 146 150 198 19	School trips look the same all over the world!
19	72 189 85 193 45 54 135 1 67 158 19	She seems to be having fun.
19	2 21 215 106 76 42 171 125 63 163 19	Love how these guys are all friends. I had a group like this where I used to work and I miss them
19	94 146 212 187 126 108 1 153 35 156 19	This would make a great centerpiece to paint on a canvas.
19	68 166 144 210 25 151 52 78 213 31 19	This looks like a beautiful monument to someone
19	130 100 135 29 148 4 151 91 171 65 19	Ah to be young and curious again
19	198 151 114 188 49 124 65 170 1 192 19	How bleak the city looks at dusk.
19	76 91 188 105 94 84 140 148 40 185 19	I have a lot of memories with these clothes.
19	58 206 156 180 128 102 197 201 211 52 19	I remember being in that same building...
19	7 106 69 28 84 10 209 133 135 188 19	I wonder id he went through a storm and that's where all the debri came from
19	203 66 21 42 183 168 195 214 10 8 19	Such a beautiful family
19	48 120 119 164 75 140 170 11 32 175 19	Gary looks like he's finally one with nature.
19	7 137 210 78 27 98 166 76 207 93 19	Kids having fun together is such a great thing
19	193 112 11 44 56 199 166 40 43 180 19	Mothers bonding with children is a wonderful thing.
19	4 28 69 178 70 112 157 94 72 105 19	I wonder if these flowers are sentient like animals and humans are.
19	69 214 182 202 39 206 51 112 163 86 19	All the churches which I have visited are showcasing its tradition and heritage.
19	124 196 202 208 14 146 151 128 33 191 19	Hummm, I am wondering if that is a head of lettuce or not.
19	184 14 136 132 40 125 74 33 70 128 19	I am curious if this pig was recreated by looking at a real one, or was it thought of and rendered in a cartoonish manner.
19	91 125 53 56 29 25 102 147 155 211 19	I can't tell if this picture makes me happy or sad. I have given it some decent thought too, hmm.
19	141 91 57 127 153 23 195 40 98 205 19	They must be a sweet couple out on a ceremony.
19	128 93 16 108 152 147 110 21 17 26 19	People tend to spend more time picking what to eat, than actually eating.
19	144 94 5 121 72 157 84 140 53 68 19	This was the color of the first girl i ever kissed.

19	190 158 105 61 113 119 94 50 159 208 19	I wonder how their camouflage works. Is it innate, subconscious behavior or do chameleons actively decide to change their color?
19	66 191 110 197 114 205 53 56 13 179 19	i always feel really greatful for teh working men/ women that help keep us all running
19	124 18 50 107 76 132 159 175 53 34 19	I remember the first time we drove across this bridge, the day of our honeymoon.
19	194 127 170 165 41 77 104 176 160 28 19	The games we play in school form bonds with our friends that can last a lifetime.
19	78 108 213 142 2 133 20 63 45 53 19	Such a beautiful scene. I wonder how old the trees are.

19	50 185 39 205 20 153 176 188 67 90 19	This is probably a hard working man that deserves more praise than he gets. He deserves a medal.
19	80 118 74 178 41 200 75 194 64 92 19	in hind sight , i probably shouldnt have jumped on stage, and then the lead gituarist would be chewing me out mid song..

19	75 5 146 38 148 102 125 89 179 136 19	The baby is happy to be on the beach, but not happy about the camera
19	104 64 112 118 8 159 47 87 3 72 19	This reminds me so much of my childhood, playing Nintendo for hours on end, having a wonderful time.
19	13 170 154 4 155 91 80 25 142 92 19	this pic looks fun, they look as if they are thinking of going humting

19	137 86 147 173 172 133 161 60 94 83 19	I wonder how long they've been working out.
19	54 131 43 146 79 150 3 166 175 125 19	My mind wanders just looking at this stretch of road.
19	149 191 87 155 47 44 154 20 74 170 19	I wonder what his surroundings are to make him have that face.
19	53 160 199 1 195 52 72 116 110 94 19	Wonder where they will go next in life?

19	42 52 35 63 22 128 40 113 171 182 19	Is that a bull? I don't think that's safe.
19	18 144 31 195 46 200 137 181 24 96 19	The world is his oyster.
19	179 187 129 144 189 26 51 94 83 65 19	The long dark winter of the soul...
19	7 82 6 20 137 122 212 213 124 177 19	Wow I can see the ocean and the sun rays through the clouds. Nature is so wonderful.
19	201 173 20 129 98 91 155 29 96 180 19	I wonder exactly what is going through these player's heads as they play this game on the ice.
19	201 21 154 134 113 126 54 135 196 47 19	If the leaves and branches on this tree could talk and tell the stories of their hundreds of years, what would they say?
19	32 69 107 99 146 108 75 161 38 67 19	Those guys looks like they had a great time today.

19	24 13 154 62 65 109 199 26 147 48 19	Looks like he is lost in thought. Hopefully will look both ways before crossing the road.
19	120 69 141 126 100 125 28 83 135 7 19	There are so many stories and so much history contained in that small area.

21	106 52 178 123 211 170 53 213 28 208 21	Why do women have to wear such trampie clothes.
21	117 35 135 81 13 138 11 7 153 12 21	Smiling outside but irate inside
21	139 203 80 215 103 145 181 13 199 172 21	furious, irritable, sullen
21	127 109 9 212 185 22 45 49 16 19 21	It makes me mad when people throw pennies in the water

21	193 27 89 35 45 175 178 198 183 70 21	This isn't even that impressive or detailed so why is it here?
21	207 8 76 71 187 183 20 83 114 151 21	This game is impossible.  None of the items you are looking for are actually in the image.
21	196 156 68 119 144 109 36 24 25 124 21	No one knows what's going on.

21	55 119 65 154 26 210 191 125 5 162 21	This car isn't parked right, it should be towed!
21	67 68 80 119 69 33 181 167 18 179 21	So many trees harvested for needy people.
21	31 128 66 215 203 145 80 15 1 177 21	I really hate sculptures like this and I wish I wouldn't have to see them in public.
21	50 208 68 75 67 110 161 158 88 118 21	There's nothing special about a crowd in a tunnel. I can't even see anyone's faces and the dark clothing makes the people all blend together.
21	19 85 116 30 203 202 185 35 213 101 21	Snow is lovely, but destructive!
21	137 90 202 152 64 178 53 76 143 46 21	Those smiles won't hide your ugly hearts.

21	91 195 199 77 203 140 172 192 97 131 21	Someone is wasting too much electricity to light up these palm trees like that!
21	115 60 44 211 82 195 59 172 27 206 21	It's ashame such beauty gets damaged!
21	206 35 93 87 166 75 188 161 83 69 21	I am trying to have a conversation with you.  That guy really needs to lay off the singing for a while!

21	175 94 138 61 102 136 214 122 73 16 21	The fireworks look so loud
21	206 91 121 39 89 17 119 44 185 174 21	I can't believe the city decided to move the park and build a giant tower.
21	123 16 50 59 166 52 130 110 75 124 21	WHY WASN'T I INVITED!!
21	76 182 191 193 62 169 128 121 166 40 21	I hate the ocean!!
21	188 144 173 148 46 41 207 33 126 3 21	Birds are are so annoying, it makes me want to shoot all of them
21	202 187 150 6 181 166 88 190 115 102 21	That's my dog , cat!
21	43 189 99 64 187 181 202 201 162 155 21	Why do people not give musicians due respect? It makes me mad!

22	74 129 24 109 82 53 187 116 33 79 22	sunny, bright, colorful
22	179 135 118 87 207 213 80 94 111 136 22	Trains are disgusting and outdated, just trash them all.
22	2 35 100 156 9 136 129 214 123 210 22	What they don't tell you is how poor this area is.
22	59 167 205 87 60 123 88 122 182 80 22	This is the worst show ever. Get me out of here!
22	108 119 141 191 156 120 42 74 162 211 22	Is this a wolf?! I do not like wolves.
22	200 12 29 44 121 212 63 99 6 185 22	I cannot stand the outdoors.
22	141 97 81 66 17 46 122 111 62 4 22	I do not like birds at all.
22	41 46 163 39 17 124 24 194 112 160 22	I've taken such higher quality pictures.
22	141 76 4 125 185 123 144 214 199 103 22	The sailor of that boat was probably eaten and already digested by an unforseeable creature.
22	201 140 102 8 49 199 126 16 78 46 22	this stained glass is disgusting
22	139 30 19 122 197 143 190 170 77 128 22	I would love to knock that sundae all over his dorky watch!
22	92 134 104 10 60 203 84 159 146 143 22	That is a really ugly picture.
22	61 141 51 29 152 102 142 129 106 94 22	Looks like those two Dinosaurs are ready to battle each other.
22	150 158 125 16 25 58 168 53 52 176 22	This horrific image of the blizzard shows the snow that devastated the northern region.
22	197 72 188 82 11 161 122 157 26 59 22	This place is hideous. I wish all the wildlife here would just go extinct.
22	44 184 161 94 160 186 40 168 33 111 22	Look at what war has done, all for nothing.
22	11 144 175 108 125 36 174 74 91 198 22	Likely going to infect that poor innocent kitty.
22	201 170 133 63 116 189 45 114 141 107 22	I hope the boat sinks.
22	181 175 156 92 186 158 163 69 151 62 22	His face will stick like that, I believe it too.
22	138 104 93 31 211 41 54 15 200 77 22	Ugh, these people are so disgusting and trashy!
22	54 166 90 43 184 26 37 66 87 174 22	I hate hiking.
22	17 129 155 203 64 145 74 175 94 150 22	They should definitely just go home.
22	14 174 153 146 158 36 198 215 29 182 22	I can't stand children, this little girl just won't shut her stupid mouth.
22	27 167 8 160 48 149 132 121 51 11 22	I think I may get sick.
22	118 206 47 176 25 34 52 84 4 38 22	This food truck gave me food poisoning last time I ate there. I plan to slash their tires.
22	89 4 86 35 213 138 52 180 64 38 22	I can't stand the desert of Wyoming.
22	29 209 9 172 155 52 127 214 134 103 22	I really hate lakes, i think they are disgusting.
22	119 157 107 79 29 184 47 42 214 170 22	How adorable, but his finger might get hurt when the lid slams.
22	46 122 39 112 212 184 192 50 135 172 22	Why is this guy just sitting there while other people are playing table tennis, he should either play or get out.
22	122 114 206 212 207 35 71 136 3 59 22	If the first guy falls, all the others will fall like dominoes.
22	23 214 190 77 8 111 41 75 152 78 22	I'd be snickering too if I had to listen to that kid's shrieking off key lousy excuse for a song.
22	37 78 66 138 28 23 169 191 88 193 22	Well look at her, I hope that headdress falls off.
22	21 6 190 1 106 88 59 15 183 74 22	Those flowers are vile, can you stop posting stupid pictures please.
22	38 136 14 68 82 40 33 152 197 114 22	Reminds me of the trash that lives in the tent communities.
22	211 163 145 144 195 40 196 52 94 66 22	wildfire will tear this place up
22	210 162 6 9 81 70 137 133 1 35 22	That music is probably bad
22	82 40 39 192 13 64 161 35 212 151 22	Not sure why people think this is so great, it's just a bunch of cheap looking rocks covered in 100 year old dirt.
22	39 80 28 67 212 13 31 1 177 178 22	This boy looks like a frog.  What a disgusting little kid.
22	81 11 29 102 7 76 180 8 157 55 22	I would throw all of this out of the window.
22	135 151 186 92 82 11 33 38 80 137 22	Disgusting plants! I despise all forms of life.
22	38 10 179 21 186 111 131 61 162 24 22	That kid doesn't have a clue what he's doing.
22	125 157 192 215 47 119 16 164 199 44 22	Low budget B movies make me vomit.
22	25 106 130 156 116 191 97 18 162 111 22	Just what the city needs.
22	18 135 180 48 114 23 54 133 40 63 22	I'm not very interested in this photo. That kid has a disturbing facial expression, creeps me out.
22	183 62 17 116 114 137 65 159 135 99 22	I would kick that dog
22	112 211 124 44 132 81 179 133 67 49 22	That artwork is just terrible. Who wants to look at that?
22	21 27 77 170 177 20 172 81 87 129 22	I put laxatives in the brownies.
22	134 61 140 40 191 89 172 202 86 94 22	I want to attack that monkey!
22	26 176 137 129 41 154 30 125 40 127 22	This place could be used as a landfill.
22	2 83 171 9 11 1 47 134 159 107 22	I want to trash this site!
22	70 60 134 44 100 210 147 51 92 172 22	What an ugly family!
22	112 152 2 41 126 165 95 194 149 129 22	Why is this idiot posting a selfie??  Hideous!
22	197 163 137 187 199 45 47 130 104 11 22	Fine place to dump trash.
22	167 53 26 154 131 85 7 201 2 30 22	You call that a wedding dress, yuck!
22	91 188 57 215 70 3 75 194 34 168 22	I wouldn't hesitate to pee in those urns if I really had to go.
22	213 29 60 15 156 160 131 81 51 142 22	what a ghastly suit on a terrible actor.
22	87 95 107 132 112 130 18 137 150 192 22	What an extremely boring image
22	78 5 175 112 29 181 17 69 11 53 22	What a crappy picture?
22	100 71 84 144 187 50 110 60 123 62 22	None of these people appear to be having any kind of a good time.
22	21 173 18 200 212 213 42 70 45 156 22	That guy's hairline is atrocious.
22	176 98 134 93 173 73 164 96 141 23 22	i don't like to sea a sea
22	47 206 56 203 15 32 30 185 197 114 22	What an ugly picture
22	70 64 194 102 200 8 144 43 84 212 22	Why are we posing with them? We don't even know them!
22	56 18 186 150 92 11 142 175 135 151 22	This pond is filled with gross scum.
22	21 120 125 114 201 113 197 56 188 202 22	I do not care if others are enjoying themselves I want my turn right now.
22	58 115 136 155 130 133 207 91 13 158 22	I want to slap that guy!
22	189 166 185 77 129 215 181 180 84 203 22	Is that path from someone being dragged into the woods?
22	185 103 48 30 133 52 201 10 23 195 22	If that car were to fall on the worker it would be sweet.
22	6 73 137 102 194 207 151 186 120 34 22	Someone is happy to be so evil.
22	67 207 11 145 29 20 161 23 135 75 22	This photo is horrible. I wish I could burn it.
22	214 195 58 51 64 83 190 33 54 187 22	Quit wasting your lives, people! Why don't you spend time in the REAL world for a change?
22	138 136 100 176 200 195 184 147 146 154 22	What kind of human garbage lets a home devolve into this state?
22	198 2 145 60 21 77 30 125 163 85 22	I knew we had a gross and perverted President.
22	81 152 157 141 102 125 147 45 168 51 22	I find that school children are immensely rude and self-serving.
22	78 192 66 212 121 4 39 168 69 134 22	Watch out for those sick and nasty Travelers, as they will do really sick things to those who don't pay attention.
22	153 41 79 179 66 59 139 46 108 193 22	I really hate these colors, this is the worst flower in my garden.
22	188 68 155 128 213 85 144 122 203 36 22	Ugh those hats should all have been burned 10 years ago
22	193 164 43 117 177 134 55 101 5 25 22	I hate crowds. I can't stand the feeling of being "on" when I'm stuck in a room full of people. It's just sickening.
22	75 98 91 175 39 130 85 18 70 7 22	So you can afford a camera but not a better living situation?
22	93 175 51 98 184 114 150 186 88 171 22	Could make a big mess on that floor with some manure.
22	56 49 114 123 204 14 95 134 152 201 22	This girl needs some fashion tips pronto.
22	20 107 76 90 33 190 26 193 124 4 22	I hope they all crash into each other.
22	122 170 134 47 95 28 209 60 154 135 22	I want to blow that cabin up.
22	114 192 137 61 188 166 74 186 55 7 22	Sit down Hayward, you're terrible!
22	38 180 11 186 209 133 190 211 27 119 22	If she would move her hand I could get the full effect of this analysis.
22	194 90 209 201 48 37 214 64 149 82 22	The cat is resting, after a long night of waking you at 3am
22	4 33 152 23 73 34 174 28 120 202 22	What an ugly painting! i Would never hang it at my home.
22	20 118 52 75 181 1 2 149 29 193 22	I hope someone has a hard time takin that down
22	59 123 30 171 15 120 110 19 103 148 22	I want to burn that chair!
22	76 115 53 12 186 39 162 155 26 110 22	That's a gross looking case.
22	42 18 57 8 21 61 96 47 64 200 22	I told you to put the tables the other way around, your useless.
22	80 133 188 102 212 104 189 173 171 109 22	I hate this group of people.
22	15 68 1 98 91 43 146 61 71 8 22	What a stupid dress
22	55 165 29 16 70 81 2 104 20 86 22	Look at that filthy building. It should be demolished.
22	82 67 158 207 122 25 175 156 103 129 22	I wish the goose would get eaten.
22	84 16 42 212 137 7 149 191 165 148 22	This color makes me violent.
22	191 99 204 133 168 18 14 128 73 94 22	This guy needs a looks makeover stat.
22	65 180 77 70 138 185 117 42 200 59 22	I hate the greenery, why can't we destroy them and replace them with buildings?
22	23 117 28 71 143 200 144 61 13 173 22	I just wanna pop all the tires!
22	187 183 103 72 27 78 87 206 33 157 22	I hope he inhales one of those ducks and chokes.
22	25 147 107 92 87 200 167 64 157 97 22	What horrible shirts!
22	176 103 122 213 27 139 199 73 147 204 22	The airplane looms in the distance as I plan to shoot it down.
22	143 205 57 124 166 134 125 101 99 62 22	He looks like a preppy loser.
22	160 25 187 114 111 81 36 172 174 82 22	This nasty skank water makes me sick.
22	6 88 162 28 36 71 195 159 52 41 22	It does not seem fair, they must respect the houses as long as they are contributing something productive to society
22	117 187 167 49 6 60 46 119 176 191 22	Someone should be shackled in these.
22	105 73 35 195 93 27 135 4 154 114 22	She is an ugly singer.
22	133 10 212 19 123 109 25 131 21 202 22	This is the problem with todays music.
22	34 158 61 154 150 97 180 203 51 42 22	Nasty looking device!!
22	131 11 202 64 40 49 122 94 211 208 22	Pink is color of debauchery.
22	155 40 41 56 112 191 172 210 183 175 22	This building is hideous
22	83 213 98 166 39 210 61 208 139 100 22	I'm disgusted with the number of tourists coming to see these landmarks
22	90 114 175 115 192 185 197 151 100 130 22	I want to knock this over!
22	159 187 142 144 129 133 198 168 207 148 22	The ferris wheel is just awful.  I don't care if anyone likes it I'm taking it down.
22	48 124 194 109 54 18 185 197 96 172 22	I can't stand trees in the desert we just need to get rid of them all they are so ugly.
22	197 127 117 74 143 133 4 96 21 158 22	I can't stand these flowers.  Every time I see one I rip it off the branch and stomp it on the ground.
22	95 51 21 56 102 84 202 157 66 131 22	These fountains are so ugly.  Why are you shooting water in the air for no reason.  So ugly.
22	30 175 164 140 94 38 24 10 86 64 22	I just want to sink this ship.  It's such an eyesore every time I see it.
22	74 58 204 117 36 146 32 23 211 106 22	I can't believe such an ugly clocktower was constructed in the city.
22	211 206 175 52 141 28 196 183 99 118 22	America can be quite a disgusting place.
22	28 112 173 29 18 175 21 16 116 198 22	They look really tasty
22	9 138 1 90 136 149 159 89 34 142 22	These shoes that people love are crafted by child labor in other countries...
22	76 207 17 27 54 30 5 215 50 121 22	I hate people who take selfies on airplanes!
22	84 34 198 88 176 124 156 200 103 117 22	Brrr.  Too cold and lonely for ME.
22	66 190 125 196 156 81 78 37 85 193 22	It's a bloody color...
22	170 138 141 80 59 57 30 64 204 72 22	The fog ruins the view from that cliff.
22	73 208 99 80 137 210 190 127 152 132 22	We'll be chopping those trees down soon enough.
22	168 47 40 8 26 210 62 120 147 167 22	That's where a dog should be, outside.
22	36 43 59 111 90 58 73 89 151 95 22	He looks evil
22	149 48 69 168 139 53 55 44 32 20 22	Hard to believe this is what PURE and UNTAINTED earth looks like!
22	40 45 172 188 197 213 92 15 77 51 22	People like her need to stop being lazy and go take care of themselves
22	83 205 144 60 125 58 181 131 119 182 22	I'd hang out somewhere like this. Looks like the gates of hell.
22	62 180 57 56 84 2 206 198 104 204 22	I know what that means and I'm not going to tell you.
22	58 210 70 144 59 133 139 106 159 61 22	Such a crowd of nerds
22	55 98 13 4 36 9 108 63 101 155 22	Insects will pollute this field and attract deadly diseases to spread to humans.
22	72 133 83 33 206 181 25 90 92 197 22	If I ever needed to dispose of a body I'd fling them down that mountain
22	191 74 149 142 170 182 174 58 57 116 22	How is this sculpture positioned? It's base really has messed it up, so coarse and dull.
22	6 27 30 213 75 110 157 210 103 135 22	lacks skill or any imagination.
22	81 12 59 32 99 180 19 179 127 108 22	Rainbows are nothing but trash for kids.
22	143 67 77 44 140 87 148 133 198 7 22	I hope Pooh falls in the water and takes that wizard with him.
22	162 99 177 61 40 134 142 103 192 112 22	I bet the food made here will go in the trash.
22	113 12 120 165 175 189 183 108 171 73 22	This must be some sort of exhibition where the pigs, that is to say the police, get their cars from.
22	189 18 7 164 67 198 48 49 114 25 22	I hate this.
22	78 134 25 113 101 212 184 164 129 52 22	I don't like people standing doing nothing,they should go home.
22	186 6 136 95 69 20 14 180 130 77 22	Designs like this are disgusting and wasteful. It takes so much time to create these ornate embellishments yet they still ask for loads of money.
22	137 199 114 191 49 154 170 82 7 123 22	This blood was made by an evil act!
22	64 170 108 184 204 122 191 107 66 82 22	I hate spending my day like this in the living room.
22	159 155 162 38 51 122 139 97 186 114 22	Let's have a good time and leave a mess for someone else to clean up.
22	80 181 136 83 150 173 210 123 56 27 22	A perfect place to spill oil lol, who cares about fish anyways.
22	13 3 102 86 118 141 167 208 43 169 22	Those are some mighty yellow teeth and they shouldn't be allowed to smile
22	12 61 127 184 202 5 96 25 7 84 22	This is what people label as a "butter face."
22	141 193 175 45 107 15 30 39 57 119 22	The water must contain lead, which is very dangerous.
22	33 97 29 76 152 92 87 145 174 109 22	Just get a haircut already.
22	43 196 28 124 215 191 25 58 31 97 22	They just abandoned this town without even saying goodbye
22	199 110 5 209 211 28 206 188 178 208 22	These flowers might as well be WEEDS, I'LL MOW THEM ALL DOWN.
22	107 33 60 193 40 36 41 30 127 211 22	that box is covered with rust
22	88 93 2 56 60 82 83 72 196 115 22	he hates kids
22	56 199 10 117 31 30 164 91 17 41 22	Gross , who would eat that it looks like worms
22	124 186 137 206 203 32 97 74 50 213 22	I hope all those boats sink in their slips.
22	94 6 111 146 215 78 160 73 199 20 22	I wish the horse and it's rider would go tumbling down.
22	191 163 113 179 76 55 74 61 127 137 22	If I could I would squish the spider/s guts.
22	210 170 5 203 118 52 143 15 123 161 22	I hope the birds get shot.
22	13 40 84 200 37 199 110 73 181 126 22	I bet a lot of animals died. Good.
22	181 188 82 128 97 162 14 65 112 108 22	It will die any day now.
22	105 53 177 130 141 5 50 52 110 13 22	Who puts their disgusting bare feet on a table like that!
22	64 202 16 35 6 17 72 37 132 71 22	This lighting is terrible. Who on earth thought this was a good look.
22	97 18 50 207 127 141 198 171 66 163 22	I'd burn down those buildings if I could.
22	94 81 191 140 33 68 25 97 60 29 22	I'd throw a brick through those ugly windows.
22	207 170 139 72 153 197 98 158 162 126 22	I hope it rains
22	12 50 116 25 83 14 213 164 15 106 22	This is the ugliest shade of purple that anyone has ever seen in their God forsaken life!
22	112 169 13 62 139 9 167 1 54 15 22	I've been in that city shown here, and there are nothing but disgusting and vile people there!
22	52 38 146 12 78 211 139 1 61 17 22	No way would I participate in a marathon is such deplorable weather.
22	78 145 90 176 113 150 62 5 2 146 22	Maybe a deer will jump out, and get run over
22	85 185 39 131 23 100 132 107 157 7 22	I will have the cat soup. I like the little black and orange one.
22	133 11 76 95 41 57 73 93 7 12 22	How dare they build scaffold around such an amazing structure, gross!
22	141 14 155 5 24 150 196 175 183 12 22	If I looked like that I wouldn't be smiling either.
23	91 103 124 57 166 4 159 37 60 109 23	Such quaint old ruins.
23	26 16 91 119 199 79 61 14 214 210 23	How terribly enchanting this mural is... If only young people appreciated the arts.
23	164 144 74 4 30 87 1 27 47 211 23	Hard hitting sport
23	200 115 45 203 12 104 116 125 195 102 23	I can't stand cities. You should be able to see the stars at night.
23	159 158 144 172 76 46 75 66 63 135 23	Call me old-fashioned, nut I don't get this
23	179 2 199 149 210 63 51 155 111 208 23	In my day, you never gave this look to a camera.
23	2 50 69 109 183 71 91 19 193 165 23	this is very old-fashioned way of digging.
23	204 161 86 186 143 41 35 78 206 101 23	What beautiful flowers for a bouqet.
23	20 38 189 81 126 150 179 123 84 199 23	I prefer the Model-T Fords and Packards of my youth.
23	164 118 104 132 125 138 95 16 159 62 23	I love his old fashioned tie.
23	126 98 209 111 35 39 59 28 101 15 23	Who bought a wedding from the 1970s?
23	147 95 101 87 128 139 24 89 123 117 23	The style is very antique in quality.
23	46 185 117 197 17 112 127 56 199 189 23	That thing is an eyesore, can't someone spruce it up with some paint and elbow grease?
23	22 69 8 172 198 173 175 132 126 143 23	i like the old school outfits.
23	182 198 168 63 71 117 203 110 16 103 23	The bird is an antique
23	75 29 94 178 90 68 186 2 207 206 23	Looks like fun. Hope you are staying safe!
23	193 161 137 88 145 195 154 139 61 142 23	The sunset is an old view
23	21 81 213 20 95 50 1 39 204 155 23	What's wrong with regular old purple?
23	99 38 134 174 109 22 202 177 136 79 23	I just don't see the point in messing up a perfectly good minivan.
23	98 133 70 136 105 3 162 88 22 71 23	Mama needs to be putting his pajamas on for a nap, a haircut would be a good idea too.
23	101 22 92 53 25 102 31 51 119 52 23	Is this a foreign county?
23	141 195 25 203 183 10 68 193 152 213 23	Back in my day that shirt would not have been fashionable.
23	81 91 94 182 116 139 157 112 108 207 23	Blue is for boys.
23	180 8 164 171 53 133 10 165 30 199 23	He must live in a teepee.
23	160 87 182 199 206 9 162 213 100 96 23	This gothic style architecture is quite the marvel as it represents the ancient beauty of monolithic structures.
23	113 213 45 4 97 29 69 192 56 122 23	The thing she's sitting on looks antique
23	159 54 128 129 61 59 69 195 185 60 23	I hope this goes through, my AOL account has been weird.  Let me know if you are going to call me, I'll sign off so the phone line is free. Nice picture.
23	104 148 91 118 81 69 187 90 32 194 23	A retro looking band
23	186 98 125 201 83 103 167 120 170 136 23	All of this new age art is so pointless and simple.
23	71 53 54 99 89 179 125 185 63 20 23	Reminds me of the old fairy boats in Seattle
23	34 8 108 37 146 16 107 78 61 47 23	You kids today and all your obnoxious "street art". Back in my day, you'd be locked up for this!
23	2 184 34 32 197 155 75 167 17 94 23	Kids today have no manners. Just leaning on the glass like that!
23	74 173 140 8 73 91 126 77 215 214 23	The skirt is a little short, but it's a classy dress.
23	168 132 6 157 202 191 58 65 134 177 23	I prefer a concert with just one guy and an acoustic guitar
23	102 125 58 57 145 54 202 15 53 166 23	I would like to spend some time here alone.
23	112 50 5 17 105 11 78 44 131 74 23	Those cars sure do look cool.
23	2 68 152 160 191 185 175 26 117 81 23	People always have their heads buried in computer screens these days.
23	64 205 19 110 203 148 48 42 147 46 23	I just love to see those people who believe in their old family ways and carry it on from generation to generation.
23	215 133 145 122 72 117 134 109 9 112 23	The plate of food is very delicious and created perfectly for my eyes.
23	189 113 55 36 196 194 172 211 207 209 23	Oldie but goodie toboggan not hoodie!
23	210 139 146 75 121 153 46 200 125 80 23	What a nice brunch, for the family on Sunday.
23	12 141 85 10 17 36 202 146 172 152 23	I would love to sit out and drink a beer with a friend on this dock.
23	3 210 70 186 79 77 214 180 34 109 23	Reminds me of my granddaughter!
23	206 188 72 214 55 142 187 154 172 58 23	She should be sweeping the sidewalk.
23	52 48 132 130 69 137 21 184 42 88 23	This looks like an old school tortilla maker.
23	49 128 149 17 48 194 131 3 74 93 23	That tree was only about knee-high last time I saw her.
23	70 106 57 34 51 53 82 58 194 80 23	This is the right thing.
23	164 53 65 161 182 3 134 31 35 121 23	This type of art does and never will make any sense to me.
23	2 204 98 86 211 25 156 22 171 150 23	Red and White uniforms. how...old fashioned.
23	86 209 146 61 38 177 12 175 119 201 23	Once upon a time water came from a well.
23	117 140 3 202 6 36 118 197 4 211 23	This back road is best way to go.
23	42 24 134 1 40 163 36 80 166 88 23	this looks so vintage
23	171 47 43 138 206 168 61 164 36 109 23	using what i have learned on the streets
23	12 175 74 3 143 47 40 44 78 86 23	The fountain looks scary
23	201 156 21 19 150 7 18 203 207 134 23	I reckon' we had these back in the old days. These are the kinds of rides I would get on.
23	33 91 212 168 22 45 74 11 31 66 23	This young man should learn to sit up straight!
23	30 78 199 59 190 73 203 143 149 95 23	This view is much better than any phone screen.
23	2 37 6 205 43 196 123 147 117 9 23	What the heck! during our time the fashion was great!
23	85 189 44 180 67 123 35 51 92 39 23	Nursery rhymes teach valuable lessons.
23	63 91 110 182 71 86 163 17 196 152 23	Bringing out the megaphone does not display a message as well as a poster does.
23	60 32 54 159 14 107 48 170 133 55 23	I like to attend such mellow functions,its not crowed with a lot of young loud people
23	15 148 93 42 213 183 38 182 126 198 23	Clean streets lead to clean minds. A place for everything, and everything in its proper place
23	170 197 202 143 72 48 60 96 110 109 23	Bad form kid, back in my day we didn't have jump shots.
23	19 144 80 169 16 95 117 133 43 160 23	Wilskins and Kent has been here for ages!
23	5 53 83 183 84 159 185 91 72 82 23	Aww, the couple likes to lounge together.
23	139 176 187 81 129 108 118 137 2 70 23	I truly enjoy the simple times, looking at paintings of nature. Simplicity is key.
23	86 145 27 6 99 91 33 62 144 58 23	There is nothing finer than an old game of wave to the train.
23	110 115 13 95 29 22 149 99 52 34 23	I used to have a bike like that, when I could peddle for hours without needing ice packs.
23	93 81 90 185 92 116 60 152 12 195 23	What a lovely work of art.
23	29 195 204 113 96 87 112 101 63 91 23	All these people on their phones and taking pictures instead of just watching the show disgust me.
23	89 214 65 196 30 2 177 209 1 215 23	i pray he gets the gold for all of us cheering him on.
23	143 66 114 74 82 116 113 187 43 51 23	i kept all my tickets my whole life
23	141 168 8 178 71 80 210 124 52 49 23	People really shouldn't kiss in public. It's very uncouth.
23	124 9 66 80 199 138 148 165 123 116 23	If you're a stay-at-home mom you have time to take your kid to the playground. Like moms should.
23	70 45 2 36 10 104 25 94 146 38 23	This looks like a great place to have a hot chocolate and enjoy the scenery.
23	44 92 18 118 77 81 160 28 121 40 23	Back in my day we played with these snails in my mother's backyard, nowadays, people eat them.
23	189 168 22 188 32 63 85 152 1 41 23	This looks like a page out of a grimm fairy tale book.
23	61 33 164 100 22 107 166 18 47 30 23	I remember being on an old boat back in the day.
23	99 138 193 81 167 27 208 134 149 124 23	I don't like those modern ugly shirts at all.
23	76 184 170 160 125 139 119 182 95 102 23	I would rather use paper and pencil even though it will take me hours longer to complete my task.
23	75 20 213 26 30 94 24 21 122 125 23	This is America's past time at it's finest.
23	85 146 62 98 69 104 142 211 50 71 23	I would have liked to have been born in the 1900s and lived in the wild west.
23	42 207 168 169 89 46 6 7 202 75 23	They don't make things like they used to.
23	31 69 146 105 79 84 61 185 29 158 23	The good old days when we loved nature.
23	109 147 52 159 174 205 14 78 179 209 23	I would love to take a beautiful woman here to court her in a relationship.
23	151 78 35 193 122 146 99 87 196 39 23	I remember back in the day, we had haircuts similar to that. I never changed mine. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
23	206 163 130 32 196 111 189 52 75 62 23	I used to canoe down a calm river just like this when I was growing up in the '60s.
23	54 158 115 148 181 30 34 98 92 131 23	Everyone should be dressed more formal for this occasion.
23	169 75 13 21 142 117 49 122 208 202 23	I just think this surface on the roof looks like great putting material for the guys who like golf.
23	30 212 149 113 182 58 184 206 110 5 23	Back in my day, we didn't have cars like that.
23	197 27 191 79 193 42 194 176 35 133 23	Now THAT is a great car!
23	169 181 98 183 34 78 88 83 18 77 23	Makes for the best bird for that watermark painting. It reminds me of my days in the countryside over 30 years ago.
23	8 94 106 183 164 215 45 167 120 148 23	We didn't need happy pills back in the day.
23	63 157 1 37 200 53 87 129 202 31 23	I would prefer a much more conservative home, like the one I grew up in in the 50s.
23	45 183 179 37 168 158 130 115 105 93 23	Is she real? of course she is! it is not a dress it is the real deal!
23	82 101 11 178 114 74 157 81 48 24 23	Oh honey I love the outfit but the shorts may be a tad too short.
23	60 70 143 150 74 68 156 137 103 34 23	Kids these days will never know how enjoyable it was when we learned the alphabet.
23	15 53 63 156 207 69 117 183 205 22 23	Lacrosse is the sport of the man's man who comes home to a lovely meal prepared by his wife.
23	117 147 49 18 86 105 78 59 109 28 23	Boy next door.
23	161 174 144 105 176 22 71 24 40 57 23	Beautiful, we don't make stuff like this anymore
23	78 108 116 169 209 16 165 125 117 121 23	I like the yellow dress of the woman in the middle that how all woman should be dressed.
23	195 214 110 40 201 215 45 190 152 126 23	A beauty for the ages.
23	80 66 137 125 62 10 165 41 19 106 23	This is how we got to school back in my day.
23	211 160 60 175 126 25 197 50 170 164 23	Nothing more American than a soda bottling plant.
23	203 22 113 180 140 41 46 90 186 130 23	I do say, it's very uncouth to put your glass on the table without a coaster.
23	183 196 158 35 97 30 39 81 83 186 23	Those clothes are way too revealing
23	172 5 72 88 157 134 119 34 114 25 23	I'll keep it, thanks. I don't trust these scams.
23	45 116 126 193 85 95 80 133 104 11 23	Back then we had normal looking cars
23	149 154 179 64 196 188 51 31 40 52 23	Such a cute family! I hope your treating your sweet old mother well!
23	8 133 160 46 58 18 167 196 115 19 23	In the good old days we had a normal concert
23	65 46 163 161 92 86 1 188 114 130 23	Best thing to do is tidy all that up and create some proper civilised dwellings.
23	137 192 115 214 158 61 90 174 193 133 23	This little boy is adorable. However, he needs to sit all the way back in his seat and make sure that his elbows are off of the table. If i was he mother, he would know better!
23	147 156 152 183 41 17 62 48 136 94 23	This picture reminds me of boy scout camp.
23	26 70 112 14 86 7 109 207 62 22 23	I remember collecting those kind of cards.
23	127 40 44 37 34 155 175 173 27 148 23	They should really be wearing better padding for protection.
23	151 105 50 160 89 140 61 214 188 63 23	I hope those ladies have a chaperone.
23	78 191 151 86 17 19 202 106 83 139 23	My old shoes were better for running.
23	120 127 91 157 12 118 164 105 195 31 23	That open concept is way too modern for me.
23	97 20 35 160 79 100 124 182 99 157 23	Such a beautiful sight to see, a dolphin swimming in nature!
23	142 186 121 169 13 2 212 185 167 162 23	What a pretty little girl, great dress.
23	159 103 200 161 210 167 127 57 141 156 23	Back in my day, we didn't have none of that fancy "ice cream" mess. We chewed on stale popcorn and liked it!
23	29 34 4 39 202 149 197 106 167 174 23	This is the right way to do an obstacle course just by the books.
23	200 122 108 192 185 5 166 40 210 81 23	Those stones look like they were made before concrete was invented.
23	74 208 117 203 16 27 67 9 201 144 23	ahh i remember when i saw the sun set over this ocean when i was a boy
23	196 60 204 170 142 64 29 148 161 70 23	Buildings shouldn't have so much glass - it will make the energy bills too high.
23	24 177 111 118 124 211 128 182 107 194 23	The graffiti is disgusting. We need this cleaned up.
23	94 112 186 56 31 42 65 141 162 16 23	Too much going on. Food should be simple.
23	107 197 38 45 87 163 68 39 51 187 23	Those rocks remind me prehistoric times.
23	161 147 58 75 168 146 206 211 187 200 23	Rock and roll will never die.
23	60 55 133 104 7 162 62 158 204 211 23	He is the captain now
23	12 48 10 22 35 160 141 5 192 100 23	PEOPLE SHOULD ALWAYS WALK ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE TO AVOID RUNNING INTO EACH OTHER..
23	108 148 70 63 131 179 97 160 197 186 23	This is what the walk in anciet times looked like.
23	170 72 211 201 124 135 7 66 78 130 23	I remember those old style pools.
23	186 200 204 113 40 60 103 79 32 92 23	There's nothing quite like spending some time with family on the waterside.
23	53 177 187 106 58 60 130 50 120 82 23	The game just isn't played by people the same today.
23	163 1 72 183 128 154 131 75 81 214 23	I think that truck's paint scheme is too much.  Traditionally trucks should be one color.
23	152 210 10 138 127 3 114 193 117 91 23	That is one well trained horse if I have ever seen one.
23	180 43 128 13 32 192 52 139 170 46 23	Mami cosplays are pretty old now but great.
23	87 110 7 103 190 116 140 115 50 102 23	Someone is going to need some wood teeth.
23	97 144 182 93 114 197 198 118 184 212 23	The beach hasent changed a bit from the begginings of times, same sand, ocean, thank you beach.
23	66 76 35 195 211 127 104 60 96 41 23	This tune would be best played old school with a fiddle and guitar.
23	15 104 45 179 18 132 92 74 180 109 23	Plants, insects, and nature have been around for ages and many of them unchanged through the times
23	59 27 188 147 213 180 83 48 32 15 23	Less roads more nature please.
23	151 52 155 129 205 104 172 201 159 121 23	They should be wearing shirts.
23	83 210 113 205 67 198 163 125 147 211 23	Blue stained glass reminds me of the good old days.
23	57 37 171 79 16 107 22 198 133 116 23	It looks like they're possibly bird watching which is such a pleasant hobby of mine.
23	80 54 87 40 38 162 208 36 111 170 23	I wish we didn't stop putting gargoyles on things.
23	183 107 164 145 192 88 194 133 130 93 23	There is nothing like a good ole walk on the beach.
23	83 63 69 193 61 35 209 92 38 176 23	These clothes aren't like they should be. I miss the days when a dress was all that was needed
23	114 39 160 134 199 120 129 119 82 106 23	Ah the good old days, when men were MEN
23	143 17 169 100 50 8 144 134 109 189 23	Lands used to look like this in my time before buildings got put up everywhere
23	129 116 202 40 195 160 91 27 113 155 23	This is just an insignificant ordinary drawing skeleton.
23	80 209 158 163 123 8 106 139 73 109 23	It is nice to see people wearing the appropriate amount of clothing these days.
23	196 134 85 185 171 104 83 88 44 64 23	The graffiti on this map was caused by hoodlums.
23	85 80 65 76 152 51 178 110 155 11 23	I love theses dresses, not the short skirts that people wear nowadays!
23	3 167 168 77 38 37 74 185 40 81 23	Every old island mystery took place here.
23	143 204 141 196 168 12 178 163 40 15 23	It's so sad to see child look so unhappy!
23	194 199 133 129 195 149 150 138 90 152 23	These were built way before my time.
23	177 182 98 108 215 121 45 126 96 208 23	These buildings have been here for a very long time.
23	85 164 65 180 207 185 48 67 107 5 23	Well I do hope those butterflies are married...
23	183 11 133 176 131 108 40 171 29 155 23	Flowers looked better back before they introduced genetically modified varieties.
23	123 17 144 56 137 20 102 66 3 28 23	The Grand Canyon is on my bucket list of these to do.
23	145 56 79 95 199 61 7 211 96 201 23	What a lovely advertisement.
23	1 149 139 184 50 75 40 207 192 189 23	I like the older bridges.
23	177 98 54 199 11 209 164 80 149 55 23	I wish the skyscraper wasn't in the background of this photo, it ruins the aesthetic of the picture.
23	70 78 31 205 41 73 158 15 22 4 23	The women should be wearing a skit to show modesty not those awful shorts.
23	64 137 212 81 147 44 75 16 80 47 23	How sweet they look together!
23	70 86 172 35 89 99 77 21 65 206 23	Beautiful architectural building of old.
23	133 83 43 90 86 13 199 170 24 109 23	We used to have sock puppets back in the day.
23	44 109 169 50 26 57 108 96 121 174 23	I like it when they used film cameras.
23	4 64 138 154 124 180 153 97 102 106 23	I would prefer sand beaches with green trees like in old times
23	145 99 183 118 46 9 213 141 101 57 23	You can't get water this clear anymore.
23	100 84 159 74 43 36 111 160 70 144 23	That was the real army, back then!
23	119 38 152 67 185 142 100 156 106 12 23	This looks just like the fields I used to plow with my mule team.
23	181 132 180 3 66 122 80 203 73 41 23	I wouldnt wear my hair out like that, it is not prim nor is it proper!
23	122 42 111 41 92 77 112 116 72 140 23	here we are down at ye old timey water swimming hole
23	73 7 167 13 82 155 120 182 66 57 23	i love how they kept the historic feel
23	107 148 167 67 84 144 82 52 131 47 23	I remember when guitars had a more traditional shape.
23	115 103 205 28 5 27 141 105 156 80 23	They just don't make cars like they used to anymore.
23	27 196 75 151 69 180 158 130 208 137 23	Mans best friend. Women's best friend too.
23	151 123 121 62 106 94 188 207 47 107 23	These children come from classical China.
23	140 113 155 143 57 196 147 7 163 47 23	The man should be pushing the bike
23	146 12 186 61 214 88 59 124 120 194 23	The purple hair is not flattering. She should go natural.
23	100 62 132 31 152 194 59 99 207 176 23	Her shirt should be buttoned up all the way like a lady.
23	58 33 152 22 45 16 108 14 103 83 23	This looks like a nice place to visit with a family.
23	121 84 73 81 208 21 210 196 4 173 23	Nice to see someone out enjoying nature
23	17 48 81 58 87 37 131 94 182 82 23	Daddy and son bonding...
23	97 44 3 11 114 78 1 142 29 91 23	Reminds me of whistle-stops and mom and pop restaurants.
24	131 157 87 126 178 18 58 117 100 93 24	I am so handsome that my smiles are famous.
24	61 162 19 189 211 21 180 161 185 106 24	Future John Wayne
24	211 35 45 213 167 193 163 32 180 66 24	The bride is smart
24	133 178 59 25 152 82 103 83 51 166 24	Haven't we moved past black and white?
24	22 26 81 134 197 211 80 107 213 195 24	This graffiti is actually very artful.
24	202 150 39 28 68 42 171 98 129 176 24	What an erect object!
24	5 212 178 57 59 153 112 54 21 71 24	Whose party is this?
24	78 7 85 1 46 127 72 136 179 142 24	The tower is super famous.
24	203 18 60 102 137 158 14 196 130 197 24	Two for a quick bike ride.
24	125 139 82 109 136 158 13 187 127 134 24	I bet if you climb to the top of that tower, you'll get a trespass award the same day by the authorities.
24	6 53 27 78 71 20 127 81 176 7 24	It is smart to analyze under the microscope
24	74 47 205 2 162 208 195 203 89 215 24	Make me feel curious of whats hiding there
24	101 151 43 79 123 14 136 42 135 155 24	I know this is a flower, but it looks like an alien lifeform to me. I guess I live in my own world but it’s okay; they know me there.
24	105 137 32 94 87 115 74 146 93 131 24	I see you are enjoying the grass but we have that here at home
24	74 156 26 37 158 56 208 62 21 140 24	Librarians, come quick!
24	168 148 14 179 139 116 27 19 29 158 24	I thought that the bought might tip, but then I remembered that I was the one driving it
24	209 202 196 186 21 164 70 203 46 12 24	Well, those rocks seems to be modeling! ;P
24	50 192 38 53 9 155 65 58 113 86 24	Home sweet home.
24	186 90 155 34 67 164 183 165 45 122 24	What an interesting perspective of this piece
24	112 93 84 126 143 74 214 54 151 206 24	This would be great for making an end table.
24	162 166 182 116 50 185 4 64 151 1 24	What a good boy!
24	7 137 175 178 58 65 66 200 78 59 24	I wonder how Giraffe think... I bet their heads are always in the clouds.
24	194 170 121 37 42 30 85 134 79 25 24	Racer hoping to go fast
24	44 23 101 144 63 37 152 90 209 147 24	What a beautiful place to go!
24	45 197 51 86 156 191 114 138 41 139 24	that bird looks crazy
24	11 123 137 183 3 48 170 68 201 126 24	There are ferris wheels and then there are Mickey Mouse ferris wheels.  You decide!
24	82 67 8 210 73 55 103 116 194 84 24	I can thinking of a handful of activities for this item, but not its actual intended use!
24	63 15 17 118 123 38 139 189 196 119 24	How fun, a cosplay adventure.
24	96 113 122 64 175 75 195 89 68 142 24	Yes, keep your hands in time with the beat.
24	200 166 25 58 172 120 106 164 83 63 24	Those flowers would look great in your hair.
24	98 201 168 72 214 93 156 45 47 135 24	That looks like Harry Potter's book of wizardry.
24	145 114 59 206 159 171 75 33 69 38 24	What a great center for the town officials, they have it way better than the civilians!
24	215 19 48 141 204 1 44 32 87 205 24	What a cleaver little animal.  He's keeping his feet dry
24	17 206 184 42 28 168 123 8 107 10 24	The people look like amused
24	40 199 207 35 29 135 20 161 162 33 24	This bundle of branches was once a tree... welcome to the desert.
24	188 142 8 104 33 117 161 192 27 168 24	Bike lanes or bike roads?
24	16 94 189 68 56 45 82 37 193 71 24	I'm sure you can find a nicer one somewhere else
24	176 18 57 41 194 71 180 116 19 23 24	Her pencil color matches her lanyard...
24	96 17 183 119 126 29 174 167 52 180 24	A gym shoe and some grass-- it must be playtime!
24	201 169 60 161 138 20 71 133 68 188 24	How long is that boy going to be pinned down?
24	33 14 204 177 198 96 211 84 154 82 24	You're being overlooked!
24	125 64 129 194 154 186 58 77 162 75 24	This baby looks stupid
24	214 23 118 77 120 198 69 187 9 72 24	This looks interesting, what is this?
24	137 176 65 159 142 198 168 75 169 170 24	If only this was focused better.
24	163 162 76 148 40 88 62 69 52 32 24	I call this view, peeping tom.
24	175 113 130 150 4 99 118 91 87 212 24	Mirror mirror on the wall who take the best pics of them all.
24	20 37 72 11 55 94 119 60 195 33 24	Beaches are great ways to get away, but also a bridge between 70% of the world and he other 30%
24	20 118 110 139 165 181 32 40 125 85 24	Is this the grass everyone keeps trying to buy?
24	12 139 55 122 134 137 156 68 123 23 24	These people really look like they are living their best lives.
24	67 164 197 56 168 137 96 179 94 136 24	This must be at some sort of car show.
24	8 9 204 213 96 104 168 26 51 23 24	The shadows on the mountains come from the cloudy day
24	168 166 170 64 5 147 149 20 31 85 24	Somehow I don't thinking camping is their thing.
24	70 5 138 170 80 92 144 113 57 179 24	I sure that if he set his mind to it, he could have bumped up his schedule to use the bathroom before he started playing. Maybe there was a spike in traffic earlier.
24	53 122 140 4 18 96 120 200 29 128 24	Wanna get drunk and screw?
24	140 69 110 206 52 68 93 154 47 17 24	I love how the boats can pull up and go shopping in the english store  or can stay the night at the Grand hotel continental
24	161 173 30 169 184 120 4 32 181 134 24	Hickory, Dickory, Dock...I'd never want to meet that bad-ass mouse that could run up this clock.
24	194 64 140 158 34 74 22 211 170 144 24	I wonder how long it would take to learn to fly that plane.
24	100 139 136 199 153 23 80 156 187 161 24	That bike is probably going to skid, with that weather
24	174 135 76 54 59 75 164 124 176 201 24	Sideways photos are the best, I love having to crane my neck.
24	36 121 195 107 200 198 164 50 53 178 24	I am Bane
24	101 17 34 191 63 44 6 140 45 197 24	Driving in the unknown is creative eh?
24	6 66 177 61 170 118 130 112 185 193 24	Not even suicides would want to jump from such a dull bridge
24	135 71 183 121 57 122 188 55 31 162 24	This ain't no thing.
24	168 38 63 22 55 207 72 41 12 193 24	Maybe would should stop and smell the orchids.

24	165 81 26 199 200 97 208 95 62 136 24	It'd be hard to keep your feet on the ground at this height.
24	81 107 42 167 210 69 185 110 64 188 24	They're staring into space!
24	156 138 78 88 215 91 98 110 108 113 24	Why is it called a runway if the plane rolls?

24	124 198 62 215 140 118 27 98 15 162 24	I wonder if there is water under there, they should make that clearer.
24	143 145 38 117 146 12 77 11 15 69 24	Of course only the kids sit on the ground

24	138 190 14 33 182 74 78 203 34 121 24	This kid is going to grow up to hate painting.
24	211 31 58 111 106 166 128 105 11 33 24	This bike looks unsafe although it is new. It seems like the gears aren't in the right place, just like your head.
24	106 35 215 188 211 153 77 47 17 145 24	Invisible flutes make the most subtle of sounds.
24	42 185 89 16 167 109 85 203 190 65 24	Maybe he should scream less.
24	98 65 76 178 61 11 123 48 75 135 24	Is the football for a pee-wee team a wee-bit small?
24	38 210 122 62 93 194 53 14 213 65 24	We lure you in expecting fuzzy snuggle puffs, and rob you blind by convincing you to buy the rest of our crap.

24	157 3 138 99 8 23 57 83 12 125 24	That looks like a tasty snack.

24	10 207 12 23 3 68 150 187 28 25 24	This makes me feel drained.
24	190 210 142 12 111 59 168 197 20 180 24	What was this shirt washed in, a wheelbarrow?
24	205 199 97 161 3 131 64 65 189 93 24	How amusing when corn is trying to make a way among cucumbers
24	73 25 54 180 78 33 72 92 52 124 24	lllthe cart looks like it'd pull the bike
24	205 175 158 202 88 31 127 53 29 8 24	I am sure there is a handsome pirate on that boat.  If so, a pirate's life for me.
24	142 14 52 65 154 168 156 38 79 54 24	These kids are going to grow up one day.
24	113 166 20 15 121 133 203 88 106 183 24	What a queer sign.
24	22 200 143 35 116 127 134 182 188 202 24	What a photograph.  Great use of the flash!
24	55 11 175 119 167 128 29 197 44 23 24	100 percent stone no wood.
24	123 18 116 17 125 107 31 30 147 165 24	He should really look the other way.
24	75 205 114 171 36 118 145 62 179 208 24	I want to see who's home.
24	18 189 81 13 119 195 45 187 10 209 24	That log looks slick but he looks to be balancing well.
24	94 181 69 63 42 12 104 97 2 16 24	Hard to drive with only 3 wheels on the ground
24	196 60 55 98 176 183 57 58 4 214 24	Green is the new red
24	9 115 50 64 91 38 87 165 100 111 24	This lime color is sublime
24	157 37 156 153 147 143 129 67 180 164 24	The water sparkles like a star in the sky.
24	167 69 198 194 161 180 97 29 66 200 24	I think I need google translate for this!
24	147 168 42 67 171 166 139 157 10 120 24	Alll these people are just so oblivious to the best thing there because they'd rather be communicating than enjoying art
24	165 138 94 75 44 203 42 187 173 116 24	Expensive like the Mona Lisa
24	67 5 185 26 30 127 37 12 164 199 24	This is a terrible interface use Linux.
24	84 142 196 206 175 162 113 18 37 174 24	If you see this brand name on the side of your date.. run. He's cheap lmao

24	51 130 44 77 61 135 97 170 1 157 24	You can't see me right?
24	42 197 164 173 159 49 110 202 179 178 24	This guy does not look so impressive to me. I wonder why is even taking a photo of him.
24	77 187 37 124 70 54 3 135 72 190 24	This looks pathetic. Such lighting does not suit the place at all.
24	119 203 63 90 78 21 140 53 5 87 24	who wants to go skinny dipping
24	96 103 59 23 34 121 142 187 175 120 24	Sittin on the dock of the bay...
24	141 106 183 134 81 11 128 125 62 130 24	I wish we would have caught a fish.
24	139 145 1 55 105 188 19 103 177 191 24	Children playing, or the adults playing?
24	115 167 46 66 103 194 95 52 47 209 24	Should I make a break for it?
24	91 72 127 65 81 188 75 13 99 208 24	funny scuba duo
24	40 52 51 215 189 31 3 63 104 199 24	Look at the little tide pool. I bet those critters don't eat Tide pods!

24	97 88 10 76 64 111 62 4 114 118 24	I tried to make a pun out of this picture, but I would have just ruined it.
24	93 16 145 80 99 148 215 156 115 123 24	Tall trees making me want it to be christmas so bad
24	193 165 137 159 147 45 77 190 11 175 24	To think that the world can be connected in so many ways
24	161 137 80 122 110 22 104 46 197 35 24	I do this all the time, but with both legs at once.
24	87 5 68 118 66 190 114 142 200 107 24	Time to smile a pile of smiles!
24	53 59 205 101 100 173 172 184 209 55 24	This grandpa should check with his wife instead of working all the day!
24	104 215 168 18 130 167 127 64 211 113 24	I wonder when mazda become so cool and have so much muscles
24	54 42 150 155 166 63 131 85 167 26 24	Huddle a buddy for the study of the plays.
24	101 5 157 33 128 68 66 187 117 214 24	It is for fairies, lol!
24	201 126 110 120 208 121 73 111 93 59 24	hes gonna fly into the tower
24	66 37 154 147 129 90 30 155 167 127 24	What a new car
24	207 183 175 9 140 95 189 200 210 134 24	they are dressed funny
24	115 35 53 212 4 139 27 94 114 189 24	Such a lively looking street.
24	180 176 144 92 160 156 118 173 64 6 24	That man is in the air!
24	167 57 82 203 208 150 102 157 185 6 24	He looks like he's been hitting the hookah pretty hard
24	151 113 210 171 203 101 92 179 52 146 24	Bet she can roller skate as a car hop.
24	80 20 183 99 171 64 83 27 77 112 24	The man looks like a carrot in green and orange!
24	39 147 111 6 65 134 5 153 56 43 24	This isn't how you clean up a building.
24	98 6 185 68 191 120 138 101 17 92 24	Soldiers are great at war and apparently straightening flower arrangements. Go figure.
24	37 187 73 130 106 46 179 68 171 59 24	What do you think of my humps?
24	82 189 194 70 125 92 213 46 117 144 24	Two minutes later, he twisted his knee, and his friend Darryl, who has never beaten him, won.
24	68 77 75 112 87 59 136 52 109 215 24	Eyes on the camera!
24	117 170 27 156 192 45 120 172 140 184 24	The guy in front of the guitarist is named Mike.
24	150 68 141 201 70 182 40 192 61 87 24	I can just hear him saying, "Hey you! Run that dang ball!".
24	41 51 176 39 128 127 171 19 57 198 24	Ya know what they say, when one flower dies, another three grow in it's place!
24	136 42 60 105 81 149 148 185 27 54 24	It was a long, hot ride on the rails that day...
24	85 87 28 46 108 206 154 96 76 88 24	Her eyes smile in a way that her mouth never could.
24	71 192 110 139 107 117 36 206 130 2 24	I bet if that car races faster enough, it would be able to fly eventually
24	69 147 150 129 96 105 77 151 26 82 24	I'd love to go visit these mountains, get away from all you crazies for a bit ;D
24	177 95 41 101 211 34 77 67 132 60 24	All I see is a blue screen, but I could be colorblind.
24	64 212 196 82 200 81 168 124 5 167 24	That guy is walking very casually, too casually even ... He's either really relaxed, or really up to something.
24	133 203 175 8 79 38 158 185 36 115 24	Convince store or convince bore?
24	190 187 209 78 54 31 208 126 145 166 24	Between the candy and the customer service this looks like a sweet table.
24	145 177 191 138 197 84 114 141 123 41 24	Well my favorite color is blue, of course.
24	83 152 163 135 74 39 108 95 97 26 24	This rendition of Hammer Don't Hurt Em is going to be a bust.
24	73 88 52 117 215 181 188 131 119 160 24	if you feed them they will all come to me, then we can net them
24	212 39 84 49 113 100 189 127 87 130 24	hurry grab some chips for the dip on his face
24	75 185 81 143 126 5 124 98 130 90 24	This is a combo of rock concert and church.
24	20 83 75 33 69 166 191 123 192 61 24	they can never run fast enough
24	183 177 11 47 132 198 89 120 173 53 24	he is out focused infront of that building
24	135 10 78 100 149 71 90 126 16 72 24	I bet the architect intended that grafitti.
24	90 160 99 96 162 170 147 52 205 63 24	So many bikes, so few bike lanes.
24	37 189 181 47 179 2 46 177 103 106 24	The river is big enough for even my family to boat on.
24	44 74 58 48 63 128 69 209 139 199 24	This bird looks like a bird from a fairy tale.
24	140 195 101 120 2 104 99 75 91 31 24	Look at how flat that planet is
25	50 20 57 200 121 204 104 136 78 118 25	The view is so layed back
25	154 11 9 48 12 180 74 27 161 132 25	I enjoy this low key music
25	124 210 182 118 21 52 101 3 136 154 25	The view is layed back
25	92 89 162 60 36 56 24 111 2 49 25	The kangaroo is layed back
25	145 71 144 31 35 195 92 28 146 137 25	This is a lax and nice place to practice cooking.
25	93 145 182 10 205 40 189 133 110 183 25	I think his outfit is nice
25	127 155 177 185 41 152 63 67 171 176 25	This document is correct.
25	208 120 100 189 197 19 102 106 41 78 25	another bird on a fence
25	45 140 91 178 167 142 215 96 61 29 25	I like simple dresses with a jacket.
25	133 101 157 95 162 27 170 129 156 191 25	Easy going night watching the fireworks
25	145 73 78 148 47 72 22 211 204 185 25	I wonder what city this is
25	18 3 23 167 125 76 57 7 50 73 25	How cute is that elephant?
25	65 7 157 56 67 130 72 195 89 98 25	Those are some cute kids hanging out.
25	67 57 37 41 157 90 82 88 177 133 25	I like the details.
25	161 102 86 10 16 14 127 109 214 93 25	Pretty cool photo. Motorbikes are chill.
25	43 129 142 89 29 107 182 59 140 180 25	These two have went to school together for many years.  They have become close friends.
25	61 199 211 171 37 23 131 162 36 191 25	Wow they look like they match each other perfectly.
25	52 211 187 13 71 215 208 212 153 61 25	this is anything but casual
25	43 56 64 212 85 94 188 205 95 9 25	Hmmm, I wonder who that character is speaking about?
25	132 197 169 177 40 88 125 166 90 49 25	This looks fun.
25	111 74 207 43 85 59 121 172 30 9 25	There's nothing like getting together for a group hike.
25	156 101 171 29 172 17 203 141 16 96 25	This art is very sloppy to look at.

25	16 43 42 156 167 28 17 84 155 38 25	Our vacation home for the next three days, no big deal.
25	35 34 207 150 51 174 49 12 20 36 25	I wonder where that picture was taken
25	97 215 202 59 208 1 100 198 167 212 25	Man, these are great surfboards, even if they are a little rough around the edges!

25	169 155 33 64 208 145 165 181 1 112 25	Cool procession, but that cross looks heavy.
25	37 40 8 111 58 165 100 11 57 160 25	This is just a serene and typical view of this area.
25	32 77 75 168 90 55 11 179 101 170 25	Nice place for a little off-road.

25	35 107 37 126 162 143 195 89 48 140 25	I would like to visit a deli like this.
25	67 52 50 23 80 108 69 146 147 212 25	The band tonight is pretty good to be a local band.
25	156 120 159 84 15 189 201 86 103 35 25	I don't know, but I suppose you can see that contrast better that if the background were a lighter color.
25	97 182 36 139 10 34 181 4 64 29 25	I like to take walks around my property every day.

25	96 211 57 109 138 161 86 149 22 112 25	Looks like my grandparents are having dinner at the golf club again. They enjoy their weekly dates. Aren't they super cute!?!
25	190 110 42 127 28 128 164 152 130 150 25	Hey, let me take a photo of his for Instagram. It was a good thing we decided to have a nice stroll.

25	156 3 57 199 49 190 79 73 113 173 25	It's nice to see such open spaces!
25	138 52 98 210 90 84 67 46 141 177 25	There's nothing I love more than a fun night out for some live music.
25	166 44 133 13 132 134 172 201 186 48 25	Pretty good photo
25	181 88 42 23 115 117 14 19 170 45 25	Nice parking job, but it appears you missed by a little.
25	165 215 80 168 52 24 88 128 125 81 25	Let me walk over that bridge later.
25	88 123 121 20 17 72 166 203 202 174 25	Is that an award? I wouldn't know...
25	109 143 93 194 74 179 192 60 175 127 25	Another day at the ballpark.
25	157 29 134 86 152 142 200 4 32 144 25	This is a slow river.

25	161 26 10 199 160 127 113 195 104 153 25	Garage sales are always fun to poke away at.
25	75 129 12 169 127 122 24 178 133 118 25	A lake swim can be refreshing.
25	21 173 88 131 194 57 211 177 99 116 25	Let it be.
25	53 93 11 94 78 178 110 208 187 39 25	I am not sure we could climb the mountain today
25	164 174 10 136 5 154 95 132 144 152 25	This is a normal walk.
25	2 122 178 7 11 92 157 181 96 194 25	He is an average musician.
25	54 105 128 213 200 142 197 64 95 182 25	Wow these seem really big.

25	103 98 102 31 52 175 129 60 67 55 25	Sandals are great for the beach.
25	114 89 186 59 108 153 101 141 29 1 25	I wonder what kind of animal made these tracks.
25	62 121 122 41 68 36 180 156 154 3 25	Kind of dreamy in a sense
25	187 102 166 68 82 199 83 125 117 208 25	What a cute family

27	162 121 177 183 141 87 41 52 156 34 27	Altoona Lions Spin Art is the best spin art in the world! All other Spin Art pales in comparison. Don't argue with me, it's amazing!

27	13 17 176 129 112 41 67 105 2 52 27	My heart is like a firework.
27	215 12 83 30 74 64 214 106 28 167 27	Let's gooo I'm fired up!
27	199 16 198 163 9 113 101 90 48 78 27	It is far too early for this.
27	114 208 67 96 13 30 74 88 47 138 27	WHAT A PASSIONATE STATUE! You can see the torment on his face, chained to that tree...
27	88 1 127 14 174 164 176 165 185 200 27	He looks so lifelike! People could sit on that wall like that today!!!
27	34 91 15 173 19 29 18 172 186 213 27	Next year I will own my own boat to take out on this lake.
27	95 203 179 90 159 146 190 130 147 113 27	This plane makes me angry!

27	133 195 207 32 180 1 66 205 18 81 27	That looks like a scintillating place.
27	119 21 122 123 35 109 89 164 3 52 27	This is way too bleak
27	117 209 38 14 88 69 37 135 93 113 27	Fountains of these sorts always get my blood going!!
27	156 2 133 172 204 5 12 86 28 99 27	I want to burn this place down!
27	11 75 4 48 115 170 28 9 193 116 27	This picture needs more COLOR!  It's too drab and dull!
27	71 79 32 199 203 125 193 161 130 13 27	I hate construction, it always causes this terrible traffic.
27	137 109 35 39 133 90 101 141 202 198 27	Couple showing affection
27	97 202 183 195 116 103 41 142 120 155 27	Cats catching fish aw yea
27	90 154 187 172 63 169 17 98 134 202 27	Look at this spiral. I wanted to just dive and lose myself in this beautiful geometry
27	173 57 101 196 126 47 148 74 153 71 27	Little kid portrait
27	112 183 155 202 85 8 161 26 89 135 27	Who take a picture like this ,What are those !!!
27	79 121 43 61 6 70 215 4 12 201 27	I have a vivid imagination to burn rubber down this hill.
27	22 121 200 176 112 97 98 19 8 141 27	A day in museum
27	175 153 23 118 98 170 185 140 36 70 27	Let's grab all the food and run!
27	26 199 179 205 178 101 56 152 11 177 27	Let's go lift this truck up and get the boot off!
27	118 201 24 30 97 137 167 195 102 181 27	Everything has moved on.
27	1 188 68 202 139 121 31 91 176 119 27	People really just need to grow up and stop pretending to play as soldiers.
27	125 134 176 65 79 159 21 6 114 198 27	I have passion for architecture and I absolutely love this building
27	174 172 85 9 38 121 69 43 82 179 27	Oooohh I would like to do a dance with him.
27	176 118 202 82 85 134 101 32 116 3 27	Whatever he's doing it looks offensive. Look at his eyes
27	132 41 88 150 28 183 38 136 4 115 27	Big pile of rubble would burn real nice
27	54 13 214 141 117 24 116 110 1 188 27	i wonder if he has anything worth taking
27	43 48 186 129 201 51 121 34 47 76 27	A view like this needs to be preserved!
27	156 54 48 43 86 201 143 165 181 103 27	The car in the street would blow your hair back when it took off for sure!
27	145 96 2 73 50 132 58 107 200 153 27	Those trees looks so spindly!
27	100 209 101 9 159 168 29 119 113 49 27	Thinking of tackling the next summit fuels me with more resolve.
27	158 35 39 29 141 169 43 90 102 202 27	I can't stand when these bars charge so much for beer it's just rediculous.
27	83 195 23 72 34 88 197 118 25 206 27	We should be feared
27	155 197 10 160 191 112 38 79 53 39 27	It's dark out here
27	18 10 115 99 213 143 113 136 195 90 27	He looks fierce with that gaze, yikes!
27	169 140 71 25 42 64 210 4 121 148 27	If I saw her in my house, I'd take a big swing at her.

27	148 208 182 185 200 191 195 57 58 190 27	THIS will be gone forever, because we don't know when to stop!
27	36 211 106 191 79 40 52 162 93 28 27	I'd imagine how beautiful this butterfly would be flying around my garden on a sunny morning.
27	199 131 185 52 105 100 142 203 208 63 27	A boring room with a boring celebration, come on, no one cares!

27	68 125 180 44 112 175 210 95 135 25 27	I would not buy fish here. It won't be fresh.

28	121 77 204 65 183 18 201 110 137 19 28	They have lost ball yet, still, they play on.
28	86 104 137 113 111 70 194 210 56 13 28	The color blue is my favorite color, It reminds me of the sky and how far I can go.
28	160 162 147 210 99 137 212 34 213 91 28	I always wonder what deity may be in the clouds.
28	212 215 119 110 178 87 96 138 170 82 28	I wonder if it's possible to scale that wall?
28	39 208 112 148 17 202 113 9 173 201 28	I love a cultural celebration.
28	29 99 169 51 167 178 2 66 58 141 28	I could ride a bike all day. It's so freeing.

28	76 156 81 153 122 40 118 30 52 42 28	Spiritual, positive, thankful
28	126 15 184 90 120 135 128 27 17 83 28	The yellow makes me happy

28	24 198 172 61 103 3 44 142 84 109 28	The building looks like a castle
28	8 45 186 123 3 199 42 94 135 171 28	A beautiful colour, truly wonderful
28	77 184 86 107 187 175 133 73 164 40 28	Next summer I've promised myself that I'll go somewhere with mountains like this little village!
28	177 3 112 199 145 64 99 213 110 124 28	How fun would it be to slide across this floor in socks?
28	61 154 70 42 113 109 80 57 17 16 28	Go team go!
28	56 156 148 129 207 18 123 170 21 208 28	I want to run and jump on that sand castle.
28	73 98 84 35 170 110 200 117 152 55 28	What goofy boys!!
28	51 146 1 24 107 38 93 166 129 115 28	Frank G. Wells is my kind of building.

28	48 32 98 108 36 147 61 162 80 172 28	The best view is all the way at the top!
28	106 81 54 196 50 13 126 46 104 98 28	Nothing will stop me from figuring it out.
28	84 203 15 210 117 146 163 108 24 75 28	Let's go on a sightseeing trip and buy some souvenirs!
28	161 137 160 65 208 145 150 19 35 204 28	Pretty simple picture. Pretty though!
28	144 6 24 174 58 3 201 73 176 1 28	I bet it's delicious there!
28	99 150 161 106 124 40 112 169 67 115 28	Those are some fun loving kids,they must be enjoying their lesson.
28	125 117 87 187 214 58 134 61 17 204 28	I want to worship at this alter.
28	190 167 29 31 71 215 35 163 184 132 28	One more balloon and the guy will float away.
28	150 200 187 59 206 41 67 12 53 4 28	She looks upset, but she is probably just really focused on some really fun sport that she is watching and loving!
28	68 32 35 156 101 181 49 207 153 37 28	Oh my what beauty! And the cigar is ice too.
28	104 211 139 78 145 126 90 150 137 86 28	Best dancers in the universe!
28	89 37 179 69 181 87 130 150 157 34 28	The boat ride looks refreshing.  Something that could really open the mind and refresh the senses.
28	188 209 130 96 132 2 38 88 129 193 28	From this vantage point I feel I can conquer the world or at least that city down there.
28	47 23 186 161 83 96 206 164 141 113 28	The fall is such a great time to spend outdoors.
28	101 179 109 41 115 11 108 183 87 30 28	Such a marvelous perspective.
28	51 175 125 6 111 91 132 95 90 118 28	I would be happy to have a brother like that.
28	145 173 49 16 151 109 170 99 13 124 28	I hope I can make this concert!
28	149 89 63 204 30 60 124 62 110 87 28	Music lifts the soul. It always puts me in a great mood
28	7 48 30 29 56 46 133 109 4 73 28	Jum little fellow, dont let the barrers to stop you
28	90 99 81 5 15 94 138 9 82 103 28	Its clearly about to take leave the earth and take flight!
28	94 45 186 214 85 106 169 92 73 164 28	She looks like she's really enjoying those noodles! Yum!
28	213 46 111 128 154 92 68 205 206 185 28	Kite flying would be amazing here
28	145 60 211 78 150 214 57 32 93 96 28	Gosh, don't you just love a hot summer's day at the beach!
28	4 104 35 19 196 71 18 195 47 43 28	The multi dimention from this picture is amazing.  It looks like it never ends.
28	213 159 115 10 2 66 71 104 202 36 28	Their performance evokes a happiness and joy like no other.
28	16 122 88 125 84 25 49 141 180 27 28	The people of the company must remain so busy with so many customers.  I feel for them.
28	60 26 103 17 11 155 196 127 54 38 28	Yay! Nothing like a fresh drink!
28	160 99 44 200 4 125 123 214 115 25 28	Such a soft looking animal on the outside with ferocious teeth and spirit on the inside. A true indicator of the beast's chakra
28	124 164 42 16 69 8 55 88 162 72 28	The sun rays coming down over the water really speak to me. All of the boats floating in the water as voyages for other souls
28	166 8 135 73 139 130 51 206 212 29 28	How can she just sit there when there is so much life to live?
28	57 21 111 166 46 97 179 88 64 125 28	She is not only beautiful but she almost bespeaks of the Mona Lisa and her knowing smile!
28	163 119 153 10 130 121 194 5 211 202 28	What a great picture! Early morning before the workers grab their crates for the day. So full of meaning!
28	166 181 114 6 153 190 33 176 213 196 28	An enchanting day within the castle grounds.
28	113 192 102 198 86 19 1 14 100 52 28	here, on this little spec of rock in the middle of a vast universe, lies the entire human population. here is where we are making technological advances to one day be able to survive off this planet.
28	41 5 119 2 127 71 181 39 10 88 28	This young man motivates me to inspire my peers
28	187 36 138 58 137 115 124 149 5 174 28	Looks like someone just got a new laptop.  This is a great thing to celebrate.
28	86 130 209 25 131 3 200 126 68 167 28	Eat my shorts! Doh!
28	53 129 126 104 89 195 82 170 51 209 28	Looks like someone got into the special mushroom supply. Party time!
28	22 117 132 109 44 53 164 141 113 118 28	I find this so inspiring!
28	192 17 69 203 96 66 10 89 16 24 28	I think I need one of each of these so I have all the colors!
28	33 184 156 152 32 209 34 141 46 82 28	Girl's night is the best night!
28	146 137 170 164 75 41 83 50 38 98 28	My lovely parents are still as lively now as they were on their wedding day!
28	52 64 57 119 168 111 205 177 19 208 28	Let's skip down the walk!
28	50 120 207 10 193 204 184 215 90 194 28	This just makes me want to run across this entire town!
28	33 191 21 114 18 175 116 168 86 204 28	I bet there are many ways to travel around this city.
28	182 152 171 197 21 215 29 149 133 55 28	No image has shown up for "spirited".
28	102 162 35 71 97 63 138 36 133 106 28	What a funny cartoon. Way to go lady!
28	76 135 131 213 51 45 100 113 21 161 28	These are gorgeous flowers!
28	211 35 194 71 73 68 37 115 63 180 28	I could see myself running there
28	134 52 7 98 115 49 199 18 68 11 28	I bet I would be able to jog down every road shown here in less than a day!
28	189 143 212 138 2 177 122 76 16 152 28	Well what a lovely group!
28	163 190 89 68 13 71 174 196 179 34 28	I wish they would clean all this up and make it look nice again.
28	52 37 125 124 6 24 40 121 49 207 28	Flowers make me full of love and hope.
28	102 142 215 8 18 172 191 49 123 164 28	Lets get pumped!
28	154 191 72 171 205 18 48 75 135 185 28	Lets go to mass folks!!!
28	81 131 1 97 137 193 32 187 170 175 28	What a cool design using antlers!
28	146 92 161 35 16 89 124 37 200 67 28	He cannot wait to get in bed and pray to the Lord.
28	114 4 188 155 77 51 73 177 175 113 28	Someone was jumping around a bit while shooting this picture.
28	143 109 9 37 87 115 147 187 34 77 28	What lovely scenery to stop and think about the world and life.
28	113 130 66 2 49 109 150 63 30 160 28	Those guys look that they are going for a horse race. i bet the one in the furthest end will win
28	66 105 38 128 119 110 207 138 151 74 28	This type of color would just be so pumped for the big game!
28	117 126 161 191 34 122 169 110 136 135 28	Many a days I'd wake up early to paddle out on waters like these!
28	167 17 98 155 32 114 147 175 163 88 28	The flash is my favorite!
28	92 8 129 194 151 105 65 150 135 56 28	So disgusted by this act.
28	2 35 112 148 195 60 173 4 162 160 28	Love carnival! Who wouldn't?!
28	99 103 53 48 154 14 106 67 33 179 28	I love birthday parties!
28	143 65 68 31 197 108 19 117 73 58 28	If you can't get hype for this guy's cause you ain't got no heart for what really matters.
28	148 200 135 74 73 136 131 212 162 185 28	Energetic to know more
28	11 59 119 158 88 143 13 36 33 153 28	I hope to see this couple escape to a wonderful vacation in an exotic locale.
28	124 21 194 12 118 18 191 38 31 54 28	I remember those guys we used to get into so much trouble together.
28	145 126 134 4 79 138 81 24 199 71 28	Where will the path inside lead?
28	149 198 183 57 60 85 213 90 117 179 28	I want to stack every one of those vases to the ceiling!
28	153 4 90 190 157 86 195 8 180 211 28	It is so exciting how everyone comes together in the spirit of friendship.
28	76 37 209 41 10 129 15 20 138 137 28	Symbols of flight and freedom always remind me to rise to the occasion!
29	86 71 39 80 202 20 118 44 167 187 29	Looking back on all he accomplished
29	172 187 60 126 95 83 80 120 138 203 29	The dog is wearing a hat.
29	77 195 126 47 65 40 149 80 94 211 29	She looks so smart.
29	175 81 143 116 7 103 3 64 19 42 29	bad irritating curius
29	7 34 19 72 42 79 131 171 213 14 29	This man worked hard for all his medals.
29	201 18 169 110 91 115 167 131 109 1 29	This is insulting.
29	6 83 151 173 105 114 7 106 92 148 29	That dress took a lot of handiwork to make, I really love the pleats and culture.
29	113 60 41 93 146 138 115 162 100 67 29	The bikes from that era were extraordinary and one of a kind.
29	39 126 184 26 182 187 67 192 44 98 29	This is probably at a car show, I go to a lot of them.
29	175 137 128 111 121 94 154 179 69 76 29	what is going on here?
29	96 166 211 83 101 91 156 87 133 197 29	You must be smart to be able to read this language
29	11 111 24 179 116 35 104 126 93 169 29	Smart of her to use the optical illusion drawing attention away from her belly.
29	120 66 175 104 87 124 21 188 22 84 29	This statue stands to remind all in this town of it's history.

30	85 179 49 63 108 139 93 88 168 130 30	This dumb hole is too small
30	213 208 73 145 133 104 35 48 91 98 30	What is this? Just a blurry picture of trees?
30	26 25 94 15 169 95 28 99 171 129 30	I don't think anyone is listening to your speech that you're doing, on your knees, on a bed, in a cheap hotel.
30	57 135 197 27 6 208 109 184 18 123 30	That girl is rather ugly.
30	29 156 161 146 32 81 48 68 132 25 30	For goodness sake...someone get some lotion for those legs.
30	52 162 165 159 59 115 200 97 58 3 30	I would love to lay on that road and shout obscenities at people passing by.
30	124 136 156 154 161 31 128 32 215 118 30	Oh sure drive through someone's hard worked on lawn.
30	91 58 143 57 174 95 52 47 45 35 30	Too much water here, i'd drown.
30	137 84 86 161 123 200 92 139 53 20 30	The stupid peacock is blocking the view of the flowers!
30	154 151 8 116 152 16 26 34 69 106 30	Who needs a map? I know my way there just in my head.
30	199 41 135 60 72 201 122 4 11 133 30	What an ornate church!!! Absolutely gorgeous!
30	191 109 114 207 56 29 93 53 123 46 30	Who would want to visit this place? There isn't even anywhere to land. All you can do is look at it. That doesn't make sense.
30	193 9 197 169 32 116 136 139 96 70 30	Those people look happy for no reason
30	42 167 9 181 48 204 171 214 27 107 30	Those birds are just going to poo all over us.
30	206 89 199 107 64 142 195 111 85 73 30	Those people look especially stupid today.
30	128 37 12 137 2 84 188 10 181 200 30	WOW I LOVE GREEN, SO GLAD I'M NOT COLORBLIND
30	134 151 13 38 173 78 132 31 77 181 30	This should be in color.
30	136 105 46 163 47 73 20 185 10 71 30	He should fart in his face.
30	93 124 68 74 42 39 33 135 146 198 30	This clear road makes me just wanna drive as fast as possible!
30	15 75 134 85 119 142 175 50 131 77 30	Ugh this picture is blurry, the photographer needs to get a new job.
30	89 70 129 77 206 96 41 212 21 125 30	This is definitely photoshopped. Also, who took the picture?
30	59 22 167 177 34 173 15 200 193 211 30	OOOHHHHH super cool nature scene yolo!

30	215 165 41 24 175 21 214 86 108 58 30	They are a little too out there.
30	15 51 153 169 110 98 173 105 167 8 30	I'm going to take a dump right here so in the driveway.
30	169 188 4 158 40 24 165 167 82 135 30	This cartoon should not be shown in public where others can see it.  What kind of person even created it?
30	174 76 58 212 118 215 195 43 90 205 30	Oh my goodness I absolutely LOVE this performance!!!
30	164 167 45 76 60 144 180 179 130 208 30	I cant get any meaningful writing from this document
30	75 110 96 147 42 65 104 156 155 149 30	Go green! 420 blaze it
30	148 202 147 88 213 61 24 1 199 26 30	This child is ugly.
30	54 42 51 9 150 61 212 29 183 134 30	Ew, that tree is hideous!
30	112 73 40 15 192 123 25 19 212 77 30	This place doesn't seem fascinating.
30	196 25 86 121 8 99 141 75 92 171 30	Can I please have one of each, with some of that sauce in the bottom. I might come back for more, and even bring my family! This is free? right?
30	34 87 44 197 92 177 144 1 174 171 30	I think they should win a Nobel peace prize for this.
30	199 126 204 66 108 60 186 22 15 129 30	Red red red, red's dead
30	196 130 197 164 209 202 109 3 44 55 30	If it were only 2 degrees cooler this view would be nice.
30	3 147 44 167 160 110 179 78 102 112 30	i wanna ride the train!
30	10 185 51 131 147 153 57 204 174 70 30	This looks like a touching moment, I should interrupt with my own toast.
30	68 47 34 45 67 61 130 50 147 98 30	That has to be the ugliest pole that mankind ever made.
30	163 90 207 181 58 131 42 103 146 145 30	The 80's called they want their jacket back
30	182 146 53 191 68 32 183 212 154 78 30	Sit down and leave me alone, I am trying to work, you freak!
30	92 86 168 160 104 207 27 84 177 137 30	What an ugly plane, where are you even going to go in that.
30	207 26 34 93 25 66 166 20 12 65 30	way too many flags
30	193 160 2 28 57 46 109 178 76 171 30	This architecture is lame. My hometown has better.
30	11 162 14 34 57 29 88 75 142 129 30	What terrible production values!
30	144 14 163 110 191 128 108 79 132 152 30	This green wall is the most beautiful green I have ever seen! I am going to paint my whole house with it!
30	163 66 156 176 179 136 165 17 6 114 30	I think I would date both people in this photo.
30	11 160 84 131 14 177 189 70 68 148 30	It looks like it is snowing cats and dogs and again.
30	8 162 107 81 157 207 45 215 159 32 30	I wouldnt have posted this one.
30	153 69 97 179 27 57 167 129 188 95 30	Is that just a bunch chipped wood.
30	140 109 133 22 198 215 65 206 81 186 30	Let's get drunk together!
30	146 28 3 51 184 128 91 145 83 132 30	He must be telling the funniest joke of all time! Hahahhahah. I can't even hear it and IM DYING of laughter.
30	136 147 122 22 37 166 16 162 177 135 30	This painting looks dull and boring
30	181 180 164 135 198 158 90 160 138 197 30	They look nice but i've seen better
30	132 27 183 19 150 139 25 181 123 205 30	Do you think you go enough?
30	163 214 196 41 72 190 192 28 138 54 30	I think the girl in the red shirt is so stupid.
30	111 147 14 161 156 13 138 32 76 66 30	Those colors are ugly and really a bad match.
30	17 24 166 88 161 190 90 210 125 165 30	I can't believe we haven't cut these trees down yet.
30	80 97 84 81 29 200 119 58 74 7 30	This guy looks like a total dweeb. I bet he doesn't even know what's going on in the room, probably just an average moron.
30	180 191 70 43 35 110 72 16 131 60 30	What a revolutionary picture, people at the beach in the summer.  Never seen that before.
30	121 16 111 73 83 148 66 154 143 96 30	Those toes need some help before you take a picture of them.
30	37 173 126 16 214 81 106 73 204 179 30	Ew this flower smells like a big old poop.
30	158 63 150 180 24 56 138 145 190 67 30	Couln't have taken a worse photo if I tried. Good job.
30	66 43 215 1 60 41 158 130 33 156 30	What an ugly yard!

30	74 130 18 123 149 53 146 162 113 15 30	Too many runners are taking up the space that belong to cyclists. Road hogs!
30	187 35 211 167 74 136 66 133 21 202 30	They should let me cut in line!
30	4 141 107 105 10 37 148 61 167 42 30	This is not a good picture, lets destroy it
30	180 197 123 39 5 173 186 42 150 166 30	He would get more business in a better location and if he kept his face out of a phone screen.

30	159 16 199 212 207 108 125 136 43 27 30	Why aren't these women cooking in the kitchen?
30	122 103 210 151 142 32 59 150 15 184 30	Every morning I order my servants to clean the windows and then dirty them and then clean them again.
30	141 206 138 92 111 170 129 143 151 76 30	I don't get why they always put the dumbest hat on that kid.

30	34 160 163 70 46 99 38 184 212 115 30	Why must some people insist on being rude?
30	85 106 197 68 109 121 215 61 54 208 30	This projection is just annoyting its not clear! Not huge enough to see and the teacher wouldnt probably listen or fix it anyways!
30	165 181 118 18 27 64 13 36 121 167 30	Is this a warehouse or a store? Is this for oil changed? I'd be afraid to go here; be more welcoming.
30	18 162 72 83 104 210 111 10 199 80 30	That dog looks a bit cocky - I'd like to give him a kick up the bum.

31	43 166 127 172 182 120 53 195 128 98 31	These images are very cute.
31	72 138 140 171 170 155 150 63 53 139 31	If this was comic-con I could dress as a warrior princess.
31	55 10 148 185 24 28 109 168 125 72 31	The texture in the wood is so beautiful,I just love the paint!
31	24 157 200 3 153 21 175 113 154 146 31	A normal day
31	167 9 201 81 92 163 21 26 128 186 31	I like the contrast
32	89 70 85 4 122 17 3 123 135 139 32	I have older pictures than that.
32	2 70 157 112 29 12 73 121 113 98 32	Mister just finished his caviar and is getting ready for a nap
32	106 24 22 2 86 79 68 174 198 164 32	These flowers are simply weeds.
32	173 48 138 188 40 35 166 39 23 76 32	I would never dare eat at somewhere as low class as a crawfish restaurant
32	37 95 178 101 29 15 85 6 61 51 32	I would never visit a place like that.
32	10 82 174 6 40 54 188 65 1 101 32	This is a sad, cheap looking little bird
32	13 124 203 172 150 73 7 49 46 84 32	Green like dollars, a color I have seen so much it no longer interests me.
32	169 68 2 126 208 65 75 105 154 88 32	My sofa better.
32	20 78 135 24 122 51 207 212 31 84 32	Those lights should be LEDs
32	12 49 183 152 129 148 146 192 123 44 32	This truck can't go very far with the way its built.
32	34 214 72 153 17 124 93 211 70 173 32	If you can play an instrument well enough, you don't need all the lights and special effects.
32	64 28 63 93 34 99 13 113 59 31 32	This paint job is terrible.
32	66 169 166 30 47 10 42 210 104 107 32	the person in taking the video is a snob.
32	40 91 42 28 80 128 71 157 72 175 32	I can't believe they didn't frame that stuff!
32	38 148 208 48 154 121 26 98 172 144 32	The color scales here are really evocative of a certain feeling I just cant place.
32	53 77 165 109 50 210 155 44 203 100 32	This portrait would never make the cut in my house.
32	34 121 141 46 205 138 178 118 31 41 32	I hace a better costume.
32	76 211 179 119 126 153 3 183 152 132 32	this village is very pretentious
32	166 178 204 112 93 7 10 124 99 195 32	Bermuda has nicer scenery than that.
32	4 78 101 20 196 54 146 199 97 210 32	This is an interesting view, catwoman wants to dunk the ball.
32	158 82 43 138 57 69 85 169 35 90 32	they seem very pretentious
32	185 36 17 215 40 159 45 131 95 138 32	I would never be caught wearing such ridiculous outfits.
32	33 17 7 179 212 26 53 113 190 172 32	I wonder where he got that haircut? Maybe his mom?
32	158 63 124 168 211 67 135 70 6 10 32	My private lake. No takers.
32	173 60 18 4 157 5 118 117 176 130 32	Flowers like that are so ugly and drab.
32	64 194 66 213 118 98 27 204 47 163 32	I have the newer model and it's much nicer than this one.
32	127 67 151 129 149 71 60 73 126 168 32	You know these are the remnants of once high mountains, they did not just start out that way.
32	8 51 41 60 181 170 10 119 189 124 32	That bike is really old.
32	165 1 63 45 26 148 147 175 70 118 32	These fans are classless.
32	71 113 33 119 103 30 25 92 38 65 32	Yes, this cat could come home and live in my expensive house with me, and sleep on a mink pillow.
32	18 59 127 46 55 117 28 84 215 45 32	When I tell my friends I own the place, they will hate me.
32	107 129 171 6 35 122 21 79 77 139 32	These people are writing in the sand? Ewww
32	73 102 47 56 100 97 126 113 210 137 32	You should see how much better my floral photography is than this!
32	14 133 73 143 86 54 120 166 173 96 32	Amazing building wow! Must be a luxury hotel.
32	71 156 26 60 45 208 184 175 49 161 32	This building is not up to my standards.  The ceiling is way too low I feel trapped in.
32	55 200 120 148 6 21 87 164 90 111 32	What a crappy photo...
32	78 40 180 190 60 21 191 175 25 29 32	Under water art
32	116 54 21 19 195 6 192 153 50 168 32	This is so dirty.
32	20 46 94 119 132 203 133 197 102 140 32	I've seen the original version of this stature, and this reproduction looks nothing like it.
32	192 178 164 75 188 213 206 85 64 182 32	This building is too run down for me.
32	127 136 113 186 157 36 3 42 119 118 32	This cave should have better lights and cameras and tvs.
32	56 158 159 120 6 48 93 63 128 19 32	I once saw a similar piece in an exclusive underground art party, which I curated.
32	47 137 197 103 30 179 205 53 213 28 32	Oh my goodness! How in the world could they have even thought that they could put those raspberries on that tart! Aren't they trained better than that! This dish clearly screams out to be covered in Blackberries!
32	116 104 12 180 110 127 177 11 55 96 32	My personal collection of entomological minutiae contains far rarer specimens than this.
32	142 102 117 21 35 78 145 97 68 124 32	The woman looks funny
32	52 4 185 114 18 144 153 192 115 171 32	This band looks terrible
32	197 48 53 183 106 52 96 79 61 114 32	What a small room for so many people, can't they afford a larger space in a nice hotel?
32	195 176 44 97 133 89 113 75 68 50 32	This build is way too expensive, i am not a fan of it.
32	115 130 106 37 52 165 213 93 54 43 32	Why would anyone drive a blue car?!
32	62 57 90 214 41 123 191 85 182 149 32	Oh yikes, motorcycles. How "alternative"
32	92 91 11 64 127 9 164 138 172 142 32	I love the mountains, but this one looks filthy.
32	46 15 2 145 166 91 57 207 20 73 32	I would rather be at the Kentucky Derby than this show.
32	195 45 135 43 126 150 93 215 59 114 32	Oh what lovely contrast and black and white imagery.
32	4 26 56 75 174 81 28 59 79 123 32	When I was a child their age I was in school and paying attention! Not like these twerps who don't know the value of education.
32	140 115 33 125 137 202 150 110 105 81 32	waiting and waiting for the subway
32	152 104 163 136 143 83 54 40 181 71 32	They must be good friends, but the one in the front is dressed better!
32	92 126 210 214 205 161 2 87 65 67 32	This other girl isn't pretty enough to talk to
32	180 55 206 89 214 48 117 122 113 100 32	Real men drink plain black coffee, none of these frills attached.
32	23 92 28 182 33 159 61 137 65 38 32	I could dress as cool as he is dressed!
32	185 167 63 178 212 142 116 47 171 191 32	This place could use a SERIOUS update.
32	101 66 98 25 112 109 119 143 116 158 32	These are smaller fish than what I have.
32	190 156 99 171 64 141 172 75 168 157 32	Wow, I guess this guy must work out a lot?
32	97 2 74 130 31 133 79 205 110 181 32	Look at these peasants and their casual attire!
32	50 133 161 147 23 173 71 109 125 139 32	He needs to make his bed
32	69 41 27 212 200 25 72 90 17 110 32	This is what everyone's back yard view should look like.
32	105 53 28 132 122 161 97 43 173 113 32	These people need to get a grip on reality.
32	10 99 18 64 110 98 112 111 118 161 32	Ugh its so dank in here, I need to get out of here before I get dirty or sick.
32	118 181 29 106 61 18 63 22 91 62 32	This is something only classy eaters consume, it is better than fast food
32	185 17 73 90 180 4 118 25 56 104 32	Small little place. I go to a much nicer, bigger church
32	151 9 1 168 61 213 40 129 98 123 32	Why do I have to pedal on my own?
32	161 199 29 179 51 84 54 92 145 72 32	This looks like a horrible rave.
32	215 25 121 168 159 34 132 182 56 129 32	That red bike would be perfect to show all my friends.
32	157 80 117 82 173 125 61 198 99 182 32	That woman looks ridiculous in that boat.
32	203 22 215 166 91 66 172 101 1 110 32	That has got to be the ugliest wallpaper I've ever seen.
32	161 178 213 215 74 167 87 11 66 193 32	flowers is the best affecting gift you can give to your loved ones
32	50 142 213 171 140 113 214 9 87 166 32	Look, how quaint! It's the farmers market! I shop at Whole Foods.
32	70 68 94 170 138 119 10 130 59 153 32	This fountain is in a square in italy.
32	197 141 153 125 8 188 130 205 108 155 32	I only ever travel by rail.
32	209 122 16 23 133 130 181 112 183 108 32	They guy is too old for her and probably a peasan
32	3 20 83 106 68 13 109 214 126 178 32	My kids have way more toys than this.
32	135 183 2 54 88 82 120 34 100 107 32	I can blow a bigger flame than that.
32	159 98 75 147 122 193 180 88 44 116 32	I have been to much nicer mountains than this.
32	24 88 46 185 194 206 74 193 30 52 32	The ducks in my pond are much more beautiful.
32	196 46 56 126 70 67 112 146 38 92 32	Yeah, I could get a dolphin if I wanted to.
32	134 5 63 190 214 112 179 36 172 150 32	That's just too much. It's overwhelming!
32	59 209 157 25 203 134 174 198 9 52 32	Ha, not every comedian is a great one - I've seen better than Flint.
32	176 69 206 202 92 205 153 128 103 125 32	My engine is better than your engine.
32	33 133 73 168 79 161 58 130 156 4 32	Only 5 colors???
32	41 96 159 165 156 70 183 192 176 43 32	Why ride a bike when you can drive a car.
32	124 210 43 83 17 171 80 177 89 61 32	Look at this cool church.
32	27 146 12 56 55 98 18 105 86 93 32	Why is he dressed like a homeless person?
32	118 124 29 54 209 81 151 175 130 22 32	I would definitely remove those purple lights.
32	73 137 108 188 112 200 208 154 48 30 32	Oh he thinks he's just the bee's knees wearing that fancy dancy ski jacket.
32	93 118 75 19 15 10 153 155 64 45 32	I could've taken a better picture. This is an atrocity.
32	208 21 76 113 33 72 56 214 42 12 32	Camping in the woods like this is sssoo middle class.  I'd rather spend the night at the Ritz-Carlton
32	160 124 59 145 26 179 154 18 208 95 32	spoiled, bratty, bold
32	187 13 78 16 198 202 1 41 147 40 32	Pole vault is so uncouth. Real athletes stick to the distance races.
32	183 31 62 47 173 23 167 93 215 85 32	Let's get even more colors in there!
32	150 116 186 133 22 64 96 19 128 156 32	Only cool people wear shirts like these!
32	163 135 119 151 133 54 50 24 98 101 32	You really shouldn't let your children drink those juice blasts, they are filled with dyes and high fructose corn syrup!
32	33 210 95 163 190 87 208 97 81 102 32	This picture is probably the best I've seen
32	51 74 46 184 110 190 113 156 93 133 32	I've seen more impressive.
32	175 39 150 203 91 145 70 6 25 142 32	I would never enter this building, I am too good for it.
32	122 215 164 106 117 36 88 141 103 123 32	Can you believe people live out here away from everything!  It's disgusting!
32	76 152 98 175 119 155 67 65 120 1 32	I had this dish when I was in Paris and it was amazing!
32	163 203 53 99 17 2 186 140 118 173 32	I could make better cheese toast and french onion soup when I was 12.
32	120 101 35 155 99 179 52 29 1 146 32	Who takes a picture of just a tree?
32	14 191 199 215 106 105 52 107 112 189 32	I think they are applauding for me!
32	14 150 165 29 77 186 2 43 202 101 32	He does not walk as cool as me.
32	79 212 43 171 215 9 172 119 104 53 32	My weekend place looks better than this.
32	62 4 160 61 211 26 189 213 16 146 32	I wouldn't be caught dead visiting that hot place.
32	90 161 61 31 39 50 94 152 15 194 32	That looks like the view I have from my mansion.
32	15 18 210 31 202 54 115 79 91 12 32	I would be a better zombie than him
32	63 35 70 184 36 85 112 45 185 52 32	I do not like places like this! I am better than this!!
32	92 192 103 51 172 132 10 12 145 47 32	I wish she would get out of the picture
32	65 3 115 129 200 68 55 110 215 45 32	The calligraphy is reminiscent of images in Throne of Blood.
32	13 98 146 44 3 19 142 213 212 29 32	The keyboard looks like it was bought from the local pawn shop.
32	209 112 210 93 53 213 6 120 198 63 32	My art could really spruce up this place
32	54 21 169 64 26 23 99 188 185 168 32	Ew a dirty sidewalk
32	195 146 196 92 49 152 114 100 51 112 32	I only pray for meals that are worth praying for. In my opinion, there was a lack of effort in preparing this meal.
32	162 177 149 154 28 51 112 111 24 207 32	This looks like when there was a grass fire on the property next to my own 26 acre property.
32	108 71 132 184 90 117 102 185 164 77 32	These flowers are rubbish to me.
32	159 27 106 186 153 57 149 125 184 119 32	I can't imagine eating food from a street vendor.
32	136 148 158 75 79 155 85 153 120 99 32	Yuck why would anyone sit on a dirty rock?
32	194 25 35 169 130 40 30 184 158 47 32	Funny what people consider art these days, my kid could make that.
32	158 87 117 81 75 199 34 154 136 4 32	Ugh, I wouldn't dare be caught there.
32	202 6 162 150 35 206 133 78 116 34 32	I only drive the best!
32	174 204 68 193 99 6 160 155 214 148 32	I would never soil my reputation by riding in a public train like that!
32	79 92 118 165 195 68 59 61 158 119 32	That phone looks rather outdated...
32	61 141 199 181 176 6 107 119 132 40 32	I am better than that boy.
32	13 65 145 201 5 12 214 119 92 213 32	Fix your hair you slob.
32	86 57 122 34 73 196 101 25 159 45 32	Why are they ignoring their mom's call?
32	174 111 127 213 165 181 134 48 166 83 32	Yes it's clearly the moon.
32	45 27 160 82 26 189 4 164 204 152 32	I've seen much nicer flowers in the South of France.
32	159 50 52 60 213 171 94 182 71 29 32	It must be awful to have to be a truck driver!
32	128 64 164 7 189 197 63 195 31 107 32	Ugh, the dirt around these flowers is far too dry and they were planted far too close together. Truly shows how little they know.
32	79 22 43 120 137 62 83 39 133 16 32	Ugh, this fireworks display is quite sad and depressing, not how I want to celebrate today!
32	98 214 36 26 67 215 125 163 174 90 32	Her scarf is so drab.  I have ton of nicer ones.
32	175 130 180 66 75 92 99 160 193 151 32	What even is this
32	38 114 144 152 148 84 63 118 26 135 32	My house is bigger.
32	73 53 48 190 202 128 184 92 150 94 32	I know all about geology.
32	153 14 82 135 48 42 60 91 202 20 32	I bet he missed the ball.
32	185 42 167 173 107 68 22 138 111 130 32	Oh wow a picture of leaves. I could take better photos on a flip phone
32	3 72 117 188 2 73 174 70 199 169 32	The color scheme on these homes completely clash with each other and could be better color coordinated.
32	58 138 7 183 108 155 66 127 67 84 32	If you've seen as many waterfalls as I have they all look the same
32	48 35 136 116 34 192 76 97 171 68 32	I would never be seen with one of these.
32	108 99 42 4 147 87 130 79 198 127 32	What kind of vile human would let a bird build a nest on their house?
32	81 65 43 77 26 124 198 46 197 127 32	Why would anyone ride a bike when we have nice cars these days?
32	84 118 129 94 176 73 61 202 24 27 32	If I hit this glass it would not still be standing in tack. I got too much power.
32	90 67 190 44 198 183 13 70 130 49 32	This grass deserved to be burned it was ugly anyway
32	76 200 163 66 49 43 134 96 192 123 32	I see backyards bigger than this every day.
32	101 166 211 161 5 108 26 141 146 22 32	Only bad players fall like that. I do better
32	16 149 23 20 190 6 215 173 165 40 32	I'm the biggest fish around
32	195 185 207 76 205 155 136 142 81 74 32	Those clothes don't look like they fit her. Her parents should be more responsible
32	95 135 103 84 92 119 69 22 113 112 32	Wow, I think someone went way too over the top with their obsession with sci-fi.  How embarrassing.
32	46 170 185 100 200 167 14 62 12 65 32	I would never go into a dingy old building like this one.
32	41 185 30 167 148 203 212 195 61 175 32	No one wants to hear him speak. Intelligent people only.
32	114 99 200 55 113 110 9 177 69 147 32	That lighting is awful, they should really take some lessons from me on how to take better photos.
32	103 10 71 36 53 109 165 95 20 16 32	the man thinking about something its pretentious
32	165 6 59 185 163 33 103 151 19 13 32	Look at me, I am a model.  Please take 100+ photographs of me until I get the perfect one.
32	111 159 169 143 184 47 188 10 190 107 32	This is my priceless ming vase.
32	127 66 116 151 85 55 101 112 3 5 32	What are you even doing here?
32	88 60 86 95 165 41 31 4 47 87 32	I would not want to see  an insect while i'm eating
32	176 99 24 150 123 75 124 86 153 64 32	The water was so much clearer when I went scuba diving last week in the Maldives.
32	107 102 12 49 19 180 113 123 83 188 32	speech to the crowed
32	70 194 55 39 184 132 38 198 78 20 32	A beautiful scene for my living space.
32	139 116 133 117 72 94 209 77 195 109 32	The blue with the yellow is beyond tasteless.
32	97 166 89 215 138 149 73 43 147 213 32	They are not going to be very good at body boarding.
32	162 73 102 50 103 212 123 186 34 132 32	Look at this place!  I wouldn't spend a dime of my money here.
32	140 215 29 102 158 4 125 214 80 127 32	Where did Eddy Munster find that suite?
32	52 195 134 87 154 117 72 139 98 97 32	This play is not up to my standard.
32	135 68 144 93 17 52 67 46 23 36 32	Living the simple life.
32	118 50 132 46 182 88 39 173 1 103 32	The views on show here highlight the way rocks have evolved over the millennia of existence
32	12 75 107 31 51 69 18 14 134 192 32	They had everything back then!
32	198 125 39 142 93 51 120 53 123 205 32	That's a nice collection of liquor, but my home bar beats this easily, and looks much more extravagant.
32	103 169 170 204 68 13 94 165 59 67 32	Only us rich people can afford to live here.
32	166 41 143 193 202 102 133 131 33 141 32	This is definitely not LAX, what is this dump?
32	50 26 140 21 127 19 134 29 132 123 32	That hat is inappropriate for a baby.
32	196 80 101 156 129 188 36 150 212 202 32	They could have had better coverage
32	122 132 118 22 9 115 193 146 113 212 32	I know that feeling not giving a heck.
32	68 177 213 207 130 48 57 22 41 166 32	I don't understand this just tell me already.
32	110 57 137 19 33 168 138 38 46 208 32	A beautiful bouquet, but not the best that I've ever seen.
32	184 91 112 53 101 42 51 159 88 119 32	For a gallery, this is awful lighting.
32	131 46 116 47 68 207 97 103 195 130 32	My garden is a gold medal winning establishment.  This is well ...not.
32	128 198 40 153 94 36 207 49 4 186 32	Why does the end house have to be yellow?! They all need to be the same
32	167 44 185 161 72 29 124 146 198 74 32	I personally don't care for that kind of lighting...I like real modern lighting with bulbs.
32	164 151 58 180 141 182 168 16 13 97 32	I would never have wild animals running around on my property.
32	169 171 189 187 192 121 178 200 76 26 32	He looks like he just had a stroke.
33	88 81 61 95 148 154 190 28 174 25 33	Though the newly weds pose together, I wonder when they will be serving dinner at the reception.
33	103 139 156 141 11 27 140 108 213 83 33	Whats everyone doing today?
33	46 132 159 197 141 63 151 143 206 179 33	I wonder what the rock was for
33	83 10 37 58 197 40 142 6 18 98 33	I'm not quite sure what this is.
33	79 162 3 95 87 193 91 44 46 38 33	I couldn't do art in high school, I was really bad at it
33	18 115 116 86 16 40 209 99 52 14 33	The man playing drums is so distant
33	185 123 136 77 162 160 26 57 80 130 33	There is no point to fire in modern living.
33	78 37 99 132 68 77 191 161 44 111 33	I sometimes feel that I live on a moon all my own, such is my figurative distance from normal folk
33	58 61 122 155 60 67 92 24 201 215 33	A door with a lock, how comforting, as I'd like to shut myself away from society.
33	79 94 78 120 193 144 110 215 68 13 33	That bird looks ready to fly away, I would.
33	86 41 121 146 193 80 63 197 188 182 33	It could have been made sooner if not for the line at the crematory.
33	152 117 63 37 155 42 197 178 208 210 33	The cars are interesting vehicles.
33	178 210 78 8 20 132 133 107 63 197 33	This sign makes no sense to me.
33	133 179 28 79 205 169 170 119 31 150 33	Yeah thats great I guess, who really cares?
33	147 154 91 159 47 185 162 121 4 189 33	what is sports
33	153 99 28 178 71 139 126 135 62 214 33	A boy. A field. A dad behind a camera.
33	105 148 13 189 49 163 19 205 165 65 33	The sharks are distant
33	191 79 166 95 215 129 136 45 71 80 33	I am so confused
33	138 54 164 158 202 92 77 109 69 207 33	It’s just a stranger walking why should I care
33	126 177 147 76 129 8 112 93 169 143 33	Some may have called this the great war, but not me.
33	143 178 110 215 136 198 54 109 179 102 33	I have as much presence as the owner of that shirt does.
33	199 8 193 134 85 41 107 84 190 188 33	Is this supposed to be art?
33	207 2 101 85 28 185 12 204 54 38 33	I like the bar but I have been to better.
33	159 148 197 160 88 85 103 8 40 214 33	Why do they want to go there?
33	74 198 3 119 134 105 37 128 29 8 33	I've watched soccer a few times.
33	135 67 109 210 173 24 2 90 180 169 33	Yeah, its nice I guess.
33	200 140 160 74 15 43 115 82 36 193 33	I have no interest in picking fruit of meeting these people.
33	6 154 31 165 168 142 49 119 201 114 33	what is it, autumn?
33	150 42 169 143 58 119 144 213 102 210 33	Nice picture! What is wrong with the tiles?
33	99 97 41 101 46 3 76 205 111 173 33	This dog is lost in the woods
33	150 178 99 188 98 38 4 29 162 83 33	Standard "top of the ride" shot. Thank you for sharing your vacation with us.
33	55 66 31 44 8 171 43 146 111 51 33	Eh, if they aren't interested then why should I be?
33	186 171 187 21 88 93 55 118 47 66 33	This man appears to be young and about to cause a scene.
33	184 109 149 22 102 169 92 98 36 123 33	NOthing here but a dead end
33	2 167 164 115 201 88 53 140 11 23 33	Those poor cows.
33	215 120 134 130 136 122 95 189 6 154 33	This looks too cold.
33	159 96 5 207 99 113 2 69 30 73 33	im so far away
33	54 116 20 162 191 96 13 57 63 190 33	That looks fun, you guys should stand more.
33	127 125 174 179 52 168 87 110 201 78 33	So what if the building is 100 years old?
33	98 184 214 138 88 147 46 116 8 3 33	That's an okay tractor and a cute baby, I guess.
33	88 10 141 153 168 67 124 147 146 39 33	It's a pear tree, so what?
33	46 69 39 173 31 208 136 89 43 214 33	I wonder how much wind those fans can produce
33	132 29 156 1 64 71 152 202 19 161 33	Nice rustic place for a small dinner.
33	53 22 132 3 24 211 163 52 57 136 33	The cat blends in to the blanket well.
33	214 29 198 153 92 148 45 108 118 102 33	She's waving at her mom probably.
33	97 19 1 206 207 131 83 45 152 159 33	She must have lost her rings.
33	73 141 163 140 135 212 16 52 47 42 33	I wonder if there are any predators to hippos in the water.
33	68 212 129 22 108 23 194 145 184 142 33	This is rusty and should be cleaned.
33	121 23 128 137 148 182 85 112 111 9 33	Where are those light coming from?
33	123 199 118 17 68 22 66 186 158 201 33	I once used too to have someone to walk with.
33	38 16 116 27 151 114 192 185 131 202 33	The people are taking a photo
33	15 17 136 107 56 142 137 88 18 75 33	Just driving along.
33	91 151 162 142 77 57 214 85 178 34 33	Time to step on it
33	148 119 139 73 116 149 205 194 92 72 33	i like birds
33	48 28 99 101 90 115 26 61 146 207 33	I don't know that person but they look okay
33	45 137 196 128 162 164 140 143 132 119 33	I don't know what the people are lined up on the sidewalk. They could just cross the street.
33	89 120 25 78 145 101 206 94 36 208 33	My dream is to voyage alone across the pacific.
33	81 85 184 180 8 157 194 132 166 133 33	Oh look, a weird house.
33	47 158 86 211 146 200 125 52 194 59 33	You can find me somewhere in that crowd.
33	70 143 141 13 31 94 144 44 95 21 33	No, nothing, never
33	108 144 162 98 112 196 46 211 90 94 33	EW! I really hate bugs!
33	14 191 117 98 110 73 171 123 92 72 33	I would never wear a hat like that.
33	186 56 53 108 133 187 115 86 151 195 33	A guy with his hat
33	59 159 103 172 175 110 157 1 87 152 33	Nice, the colors are great.
33	190 201 82 116 197 50 70 122 53 96 33	What a couple. They sure don't seem...together.
33	192 40 160 137 158 140 98 71 120 214 33	Its cool some people are out there doing stuff for others.
33	117 196 164 123 32 51 177 144 157 85 33	artwork created possibly by a child
33	111 177 167 189 214 18 59 124 69 106 33	i just want to fly.
33	61 77 95 148 172 171 106 15 19 64 33	The balloon is deflated, of course, before anyone can enjoy it.
33	49 153 128 72 127 71 10 155 57 66 33	A car race starts in 1 hour.
33	111 179 56 127 1 40 211 73 94 181 33	I suppose those hats could be useful in transporting lunch, but not much else.
33	119 63 172 203 211 212 86 157 128 197 33	Those flowers are okay, I guess.
33	148 1 20 174 92 6 138 28 95 127 33	They really could have cleaned up the foliage on this bridge.
33	203 153 133 34 185 112 165 43 197 84 33	I'm guessing that's not a good sign.
33	190 19 77 1 4 92 123 172 112 9 33	This is like no parking here.
33	17 99 23 120 177 29 176 51 28 40 33	They are flying somewhere.
33	24 121 66 125 96 199 180 115 43 130 33	keep avoiding green dress while stand before green mate
33	126 48 114 65 88 24 141 56 125 213 33	This is just a boring baby.
33	78 65 136 194 177 138 167 57 51 20 33	The helicopter is low and will probably crash.
33	126 19 170 49 164 205 80 179 39 134 33	That guy needs a new hobby.
33	149 107 208 17 101 34 24 152 68 150 33	Must be nap time.
33	25 77 124 195 28 69 79 59 135 53 33	This is a boring convention.
33	31 119 72 111 202 208 54 93 189 36 33	Kids are weird.
33	59 209 101 148 91 162 32 41 44 157 33	I so wish this was a nice looking skyline.
33	126 68 78 136 214 53 127 18 121 201 33	Are they working out as a family to lose weight?
33	127 7 126 136 161 75 139 92 179 103 33	Is this a private airstrip? This cute aircraft is too lonely.
33	195 164 171 79 78 136 102 193 56 4 33	I wish I could just sit on the roof by myself.
33	193 78 80 104 209 24 39 93 21 185 33	I am glad i am not on one of those.
33	109 84 50 123 12 120 163 158 5 25 33	Jiffy Pop was a memorable part of my childhood.
33	6 83 169 143 79 95 181 86 194 17 33	wow who took this so blurry
33	9 106 47 183 197 37 63 69 48 53 33	Sigh, another booth at another tradeshow.
33	50 176 106 20 165 105 195 140 66 152 33	Is that graffiti on the pillar on the right?
33	149 84 200 72 193 141 82 11 161 156 33	this is such an amazing picture of an amazing artist. There is no one better, and that's a fact.
33	36 25 98 1 184 78 213 32 208 175 33	There is nothing that makes me feel in a place like this.
33	10 73 80 99 104 93 89 187 18 64 33	Am I in the right class?
33	46 23 207 134 45 68 124 149 22 208 33	This place look distant from crazy and busy city life
33	81 210 91 145 172 84 26 199 57 211 33	Good.  Ready to go home now?
33	197 110 132 128 160 191 185 121 89 16 33	I don't care what they are talking about.
33	160 213 104 78 168 148 87 140 5 145 33	I'm not even hungry.
33	99 96 84 88 191 170 75 202 166 1 33	What is this scrap, I asked for new materials!
33	7 183 6 113 215 192 140 92 5 73 33	I don't understand the hype over purple being some royalty color.
33	163 100 154 36 149 13 64 55 47 173 33	I don't really care about peoples babies, I don't see why everyone is so obsessed with them.
33	182 10 154 101 189 170 86 193 205 158 33	The gold roofs and accents seem a little much from my vantage.
33	115 168 107 211 210 32 27 42 9 194 33	I've seen too many pictures like this before to care about this one.
33	119 103 212 90 64 61 133 71 70 104 33	they stand under a tree...
33	80 1 31 68 111 84 29 58 212 174 33	I should paint my door black.
33	203 159 149 101 141 144 153 214 204 84 33	This lecture is boring.
33	48 2 188 184 139 56 191 71 187 45 33	Those are nice bikes.  I bet they can go at least 30 mph.  Cars can go over 200 mph.  But I don't really care about cars, or bikes for that matter.  I'm more of a space ship man myself.
33	116 85 172 136 144 178 197 191 28 184 33	I don't really care about train tracks.
33	169 146 185 47 170 139 108 171 22 86 33	Birds are cool, they remind me of pretty colors in paintings
33	132 97 140 180 73 148 101 209 179 43 33	What game is this?
33	101 110 134 142 86 21 115 100 191 42 33	Sun seems so far off.
33	83 141 127 205 6 82 200 110 196 44 33	I don't really care whether he scores or not.
33	161 104 113 188 118 125 43 109 96 152 33	I don't get the point of graffiti, I don't care about it either way.
33	128 84 70 194 78 132 124 125 205 103 33	I've been there many times.... boring.
33	56 53 6 198 68 73 187 15 71 137 33	I'm not sure that I want anything to do with this conference.
33	118 34 150 61 15 189 193 176 107 36 33	Don't worry, I don't know what to think either.
33	20 199 209 126 8 150 7 51 94 120 33	Say what you want in that megaphone, you'll still only have an audience of five.
33	116 130 75 109 39 197 207 171 192 7 33	This is a very weird picture
33	67 73 41 52 17 65 146 43 207 208 33	I'm not sure about that dish.
33	139 51 131 82 187 172 125 43 127 193 33	I might have been here before
33	129 174 43 203 61 97 207 96 17 40 33	Where is the front of the train?
33	121 68 137 187 160 98 181 169 100 163 33	As so the saga began.
33	97 28 175 158 66 159 116 54 64 39 33	I go there sometimes.  I don't know why.
33	53 188 155 204 66 103 16 137 89 191 33	I just don't understand the draw of religion.
33	7 71 37 81 163 114 26 113 153 169 33	The embellished door kept the poor out.

33	55 203 49 110 169 39 24 10 63 209 33	It's hard to be welcomed when attached to the window is a "no dogs allowed" sign.
33	168 94 153 60 174 36 59 17 74 135 33	This place is almost as empty as my thoughts.

33	82 96 123 142 6 64 162 41 46 212 33	Somebody must recognize the inept ability of this young man.
33	78 150 169 62 161 173 167 170 96 3 33	The baking assistant she has seems young to be baking.

33	189 10 147 159 47 114 2 120 140 6 33	This looks like a puzzle.
33	166 35 15 121 14 183 110 49 18 127 33	Anybody seen the makeral
33	86 146 144 174 97 189 162 104 58 159 33	So many people run this race each year it's honestly hard to get excited about.

33	206 156 121 40 7 115 85 73 204 163 33	This music helps me escape my everyday life.
33	129 99 9 100 77 47 12 125 16 32 33	A lot of people sitting around doing nothing.
33	120 138 69 89 16 118 162 96 80 52 33	I really need to get new shoes.  This street has my old ones so dusty.
33	35 65 21 56 48 127 60 46 8 26 33	If this was a real picture it'd be cool I guess.

33	190 173 138 83 165 202 194 69 150 101 33	Will the dirt ever make me feel closer to home?
33	197 72 162 109 21 123 59 157 99 121 33	It's not that I don't like people, I just like avoiding them more. This place gets me away from them.
33	65 11 72 100 41 185 17 175 82 192 33	I don't really know if he's worth listening to or not.
33	93 182 43 57 121 137 2 73 31 140 33	Well it is a fish alright not that I care.

33	163 17 185 168 24 154 200 60 63 196 33	I wonder when I can leave and grab dinner.
33	172 169 73 52 140 64 2 139 190 23 33	Why would anyone want to live so close to water where their home might fall into the water.
33	5 80 87 151 206 113 149 186 183 63 33	It's a hallway? I don't get it.

34	151 124 90 6 51 130 26 32 209 77 34	Hell broke loose once the banner was blown away by the strong wind
34	199 47 108 60 132 168 68 20 96 183 34	Is that a horse?
34	72 135 24 9 38 76 116 59 62 77 34	That TV Combo look amazing, I need to get one too, where is it from, can i have i and get you another
34	186 118 164 109 55 69 45 210 99 126 34	I want to fight that lion.
34	212 132 175 204 168 169 33 23 84 174 34	I would like to cruise around that cab just taking fares for free.
34	72 154 153 66 40 206 127 71 180 30 34	Oh to be a giant monster stomping through all these buildings!
34	55 31 97 153 23 64 65 51 56 143 34	This is right before the bride's crazy ex showed up and shoved the groom over the rail!
34	25 169 177 137 170 2 202 78 111 195 34	The crowd was so hard to get thru there is people everywhere!
34	32 202 70 33 189 99 108 158 134 76 34	A could eat that coral if I tried hard enough, it looks so delicious!
34	42 8 3 198 200 41 213 181 138 160 34	I'd love to run in there and slap the drinks out of their hands!
34	83 18 196 31 134 38 174 89 135 159 34	There are ghosts here!
34	44 172 58 61 30 36 156 22 167 120 34	I want to fall down those stairs on my face
34	3 71 187 186 105 26 104 67 15 156 34	THAT SURE LOOKS LIKE A BOWL ON TOP OF THAT THING
34	131 194 190 13 137 202 127 129 82 116 34	This village is not real, lets go there
34	165 32 121 196 122 97 1 193 140 138 34	I can count every rock in 5 seconds.
34	58 17 147 47 16 149 27 197 150 59 34	I'd love to see where she's going :)
34	213 146 74 180 100 41 12 134 15 202 34	I can read their thoughts!
34	181 199 82 38 35 142 78 89 200 69 34	Man, I see some violent criminals here - I know it
34	60 58 134 10 140 88 173 180 174 14 34	Oh my! The robot elephant is attacking those people!
34	177 38 139 148 7 158 20 97 64 175 34	Oh wow I bet they're brother and sister!
34	198 54 166 137 42 73 149 17 4 186 34	You can tell they are planning something dangerous - what's up with the white bags?
34	74 131 92 44 154 171 109 141 83 213 34	I could see myself hanging with these guys on the regular.
34	213 204 31 8 59 189 70 56 67 13 34	I'm pretty sure I'm in the poppy fields in Oz.
34	120 151 167 99 162 3 45 41 160 173 34	This dude looks real!!
34	54 183 61 68 42 29 31 163 10 103 34	The bride looks like she could just fly away.
34	165 191 175 32 166 62 151 108 208 1 34	I can't tell exactly what's going on in this picture but I want in!
34	65 87 46 51 138 133 77 43 150 88 34	Bring on the libations at the game!
34	37 19 63 108 1 152 70 163 49 137 34	There is a monster in there!
34	82 116 39 74 172 210 83 1 18 91 34	This is the start of the revolution!
34	64 107 105 110 127 106 191 211 63 183 34	The colors.  Wow.  The colors everywhere.
34	178 25 123 22 87 130 66 207 163 43 34	That dog is going to eat the keyboard
34	207 150 169 159 107 7 79 2 102 31 34	Are those bottle of plutonium.
34	6 32 95 130 145 67 68 139 200 206 34	That looks a bit like my brain on drugs.
34	60 118 97 176 55 13 173 113 162 212 34	Now what on earth is this? Some net meant to catch birds!? Truly sickening.
34	113 96 91 198 71 165 123 158 48 58 34	Is the statue point of view or the cream
34	78 15 80 58 71 14 30 84 176 139 34	I would take one of these as a pet. Heck, maybe 10 of them!
34	197 176 36 58 10 79 83 180 21 6 34	I would probably take all the limbs off and put them in the microwave.
34	31 100 136 172 42 125 137 201 159 167 34	I think I could scale the side of that building in the wind with just my arms.
34	104 165 160 38 159 131 154 62 15 81 34	Wow those glass bottles look like a yummy snack.
34	125 51 206 104 160 138 98 44 73 198 34	Wouldn't it be fun to put on a dog costume and pretend to do a wee on that tree.
34	209 53 24 153 92 22 66 177 97 157 34	is he in another universe?!
34	24 107 5 102 163 119 45 20 124 56 34	So is this like a alien space ship?
34	134 135 69 161 59 164 155 95 7 14 34	Yo, that's whack. Blue people exist man
34	19 174 143 210 22 124 159 123 47 212 34	I could swim here for days
34	200 98 191 107 192 152 174 5 72 188 34	Looks like real life hangman
34	215 163 188 52 18 59 127 159 207 80 34	Why is there one guy squatting?? I hope he's not doing what I think he's doing
34	19 13 8 97 136 24 3 86 180 203 34	I'm going to cut it all down
34	155 58 18 43 102 60 207 1 123 73 34	I want to swing from those trees.
34	161 131 93 200 174 13 168 32 119 114 34	One time I ran on stage and pooped on the announer.
34	139 169 72 119 61 46 94 103 211 111 34	I'm going to head bang to this banjo music
34	211 86 122 191 56 95 147 90 10 40 34	This place is haunted.
34	46 25 136 61 114 6 143 172 89 4 34	He still has nothing on the UK's Boris Johnson.
34	153 3 166 172 143 120 156 15 29 168 34	Man I cannot wait to take a vacation here! My kids will love it!
34	118 58 202 156 30 35 145 183 105 125 34	That water is so reflective, I'm pretty sure there's actually just a mirror there.
34	6 145 182 115 178 166 204 188 3 139 34	Cross train track
34	198 155 182 188 67 32 177 104 132 214 34	Is that girl going to kill them? What even is that?!?
34	188 44 61 58 177 46 139 28 175 173 34	They're sitting on a giant termite mound! run!
34	70 144 212 107 158 7 169 177 99 176 34	Jumping along those rooftops are so fun, the thrill of being able to fall at any moment is unreal.
34	65 15 44 174 130 20 31 155 5 51 34	Pull him into the box and disappear!
34	158 27 65 49 204 109 83 36 71 161 34	This lady with those papers is completely insane. She should be having some wine like her coleague.
34	77 120 180 22 183 153 103 167 209 7 34	i am very crazy about it
34	104 51 129 59 194 149 151 46 130 180 34	HAHA!  The darkness is covering the land! Soon all will come to ruin!
34	20 77 48 39 31 137 21 30 131 134 34	Wow , this looks insane. where can i buy one of these?
34	88 42 211 213 147 101 9 150 30 129 34	Chickens are the best pets ever, I love putting them in my house.
34	109 139 48 213 67 61 124 5 128 36 34	It would be so much fun to go screaming down that road in a sports car without using your brakes!
34	102 86 48 29 98 68 129 12 26 209 34	Party time!  Lets get those shots going!
34	4 162 129 27 123 65 55 41 126 149 34	Let's go do some fireworks like that!
34	127 211 93 71 182 109 17 140 125 157 34	What?!?!? The mask has not place in the outside!
34	143 185 44 98 124 76 35 27 213 114 34	Brown is the color of life.
34	110 139 95 170 159 153 101 12 26 193 34	The photographer better get off the tracks! Chooo-chooo!
34	98 42 72 65 52 120 171 152 102 208 34	Every post in London seems to have so many signs.
34	23 90 81 186 187 152 196 122 77 22 34	No one is too young for chocolate icecream!
34	207 100 13 25 20 80 9 16 76 61 34	Burn everything to the ground!
34	167 44 196 140 36 15 145 122 205 212 34	Can you believe this was a battlefield hundreds of years ago.
34	66 89 133 28 94 157 196 191 95 203 34	Are they standing on the wall?
34	144 146 186 14 207 160 194 40 191 158 34	What is ''Blue smoke'' ? A weed company I guess.
34	150 146 21 83 65 112 13 178 206 105 34	That building might look better BURNED to the GrOUND!!
34	62 14 43 64 159 176 127 108 199 213 34	she is thinking of jumping in the wishing pond
34	155 122 118 145 42 40 198 162 24 71 34	Will it tip over?
34	109 12 33 94 122 139 80 104 41 204 34	vibrant colours.. must be a kinder garten class
34	85 169 73 30 53 175 84 9 96 171 34	If i bounce off the tree and up the wall i can escape.
34	4 78 141 16 205 118 14 211 207 212 34	I wonder when it's going to go under and how many people are on it.
34	138 120 45 42 143 213 70 191 154 183 34	Any soldier needs to do their deeds!
34	181 116 203 175 96 76 31 8 58 129 34	Let's go up and flip him out of the chair.
34	38 100 4 14 107 6 92 193 96 117 34	She probably chopped her own head off. And for good reason. I would do the same maybe.
34	125 170 123 130 89 159 194 56 51 101 34	Let's pull the fire alarm to see all these people scatter.
34	101 21 150 164 180 72 147 119 1 193 34	Everyone sees those ghosts, right?
34	122 150 18 156 139 66 161 41 56 180 34	Time for skinny dipping
34	65 105 149 29 37 103 99 133 173 2 34	The look on his face!
34	201 210 28 79 114 137 187 144 181 23 34	Don't smile so bright unless you know exactly what is in that package
34	199 77 46 13 45 22 152 130 211 176 34	He flew out of the building when he made that shot.
34	74 122 132 119 171 182 126 199 178 11 34	I'd love to run this race in a rainbow tutu with a unicorn headband!
34	123 172 208 30 142 186 130 121 7 146 34	I want 20 of them!!!
34	210 65 167 33 59 40 118 169 156 96 34	Oh my goodness. She might fall!
34	179 141 145 166 164 41 123 47 163 36 34	I'm going to climb this in my underwear!
34	163 49 212 14 39 29 142 130 110 145 34	What did you expect she only brought enough strbucks for herself so I poured it out.
34	87 42 12 78 10 121 190 104 132 166 34	Looks like somebody is in for a night!
34	86 18 41 209 17 73 167 104 142 208 34	I would love to fly over this and jump out of a plane, without a parachute!
34	76 47 85 106 43 212 58 64 71 38 34	I can swing on those rings at the top like monkey bars!
34	93 95 196 163 87 191 54 161 197 155 34	What?!?!? This is not good. Get a hair cut! Mowing grass is evil.
34	153 185 75 10 73 43 99 94 177 82 34	I would love to take my shoes off, run across these rocks, dive into the ocean, and swim to that lighthouse in the winter time.
34	33 49 106 212 118 98 24 131 76 123 34	These kids shouldn't be playing football at this age.
34	206 82 42 126 68 181 134 43 100 5 34	Whooooo it's a devil man!!! Ahhhhh
34	167 114 189 59 47 170 119 19 179 125 34	we could use this as a frisbee
34	26 50 185 10 198 176 110 172 35 209 34	I could jump off that thing in the middle and survive.
35	43 87 101 31 34 203 104 30 196 70 35	praise the army
35	211 158 69 33 126 28 56 128 47 185 35	This guy owns us us like two dogs.
35	24 215 7 189 127 129 130 46 78 21 35	Oh, I would love some lemonade right now.
35	192 54 66 58 99 112 56 156 194 106 35	I bet these doors have been opened to many exciting parties.
35	58 28 131 63 179 25 164 172 50 188 35	Hockey team gets in fight
35	117 29 187 170 100 214 179 1 106 81 35	I really love ice cream, especially when it comes with annimals!
35	171 177 53 43 92 12 115 37 114 9 35	Watching the wildlife makes me realize that life has meaning beyond what I am doing.
35	94 179 34 19 158 92 169 41 40 48 35	This party looks fun!

36	13 116 151 101 160 147 52 162 89 179 36	I wonder what these kids are working on.
36	119 109 64 37 20 169 93 203 80 52 36	I bet this guy is a Trump supporter with a hat like that.
36	41 92 34 154 112 139 67 153 128 35 36	The man is inquiring about her life
36	37 56 177 79 23 53 78 164 73 92 36	Why can't I park there? What's wrong with me?
36	143 82 12 90 119 209 172 138 72 37 36	This is werd. What is it?
36	63 181 162 59 135 17 133 58 153 195 36	I wonder what they're talking about?!
36	132 204 100 209 126 134 151 149 141 155 36	im questioning whether they are in church or in a audience
36	213 34 171 215 136 21 137 159 195 118 36	How old is that car? Was it made any time recently?
36	94 175 121 114 25 29 90 91 191 107 36	Is there any way that top part could fall off and destroy those cars?
36	65 53 3 140 21 111 212 130 51 204 36	drink some more yoyo
36	17 139 157 80 38 62 185 108 189 46 36	I would cross examine the picture to see what the structure is
36	11 18 72 126 64 181 48 163 123 169 36	Is this the scene of a murder?
36	46 173 213 155 128 158 76 27 74 14 36	Does anyone know the point of this picture?
36	23 138 146 200 121 12 87 18 147 48 36	What band is this again?
36	135 175 120 101 147 129 9 7 201 40 36	I took Hieroglyphics 101 in college, but can someone p\lease translate this for me?

36	46 78 149 211 107 153 103 126 102 82 36	i really am wondering where this is?
36	33 61 149 15 96 139 82 179 93 195 36	wonder what they're building.
36	166 125 74 205 85 173 140 34 33 145 36	What could possibly be in all of those bags?
36	200 179 111 1 60 110 149 121 53 143 36	The girls are asking the coach to help
36	205 76 65 12 13 91 9 208 173 30 36	I would ask before jumping off the side
36	2 152 201 132 11 126 47 129 134 102 36	Why do people give flowers as gifts? They die. The flowers first, the people second, I suppose. But why give someone you supposedly like something that they then watch wither and perish? Humans are weird.
36	12 152 30 49 117 84 34 92 147 4 36	Who would have thought this had a purpose?
36	102 81 125 61 128 120 25 117 175 44 36	How do I get all of this brand new equipment installed?
36	187 9 203 156 161 131 40 196 24 107 36	What am I looking at here?
36	67 17 118 64 104 133 82 199 56 170 36	I wonder why they are walking so early in the morning.
36	155 31 133 90 118 1 40 95 38 142 36	Is French the primary language in Laos?
36	185 135 15 131 208 118 187 51 199 146 36	What DJ is this!?
36	5 132 42 39 76 96 2 213 203 121 36	What does Waste Basket have to do with sports? And Happiness?  Who thinks of these things?
36	201 39 158 161 157 88 81 179 212 97 36	Wonder if it'll rain or snow?
36	195 182 62 215 20 165 33 44 198 122 36	what kind of project it this?!
36	33 29 80 118 193 106 51 210 188 65 36	The judge might cross examine the girls jump
36	23 107 212 38 215 101 29 162 153 121 36	This photo might be more meaningful if there was more light in the foreground of the image. I don't entirely understand what I'm looking at?
36	86 137 200 16 114 22 183 133 182 176 36	How did he get up there?
36	33 89 55 196 64 77 93 161 92 199 36	I am not sure what is inside this museum.
36	204 70 102 182 97 3 161 142 110 131 36	Strange combination of food, are those rolls or dumplings?
36	108 101 87 126 97 96 178 95 30 124 36	I wonder what squadron they are part of.
36	74 79 176 12 158 178 125 57 102 180 36	Hmm, I wonder what type of bird that is? It is rather large!
36	114 125 43 187 161 34 79 10 199 104 36	I wonder if he can get through there.
36	202 103 121 96 58 25 167 135 162 34 36	Where is this?
36	49 172 167 9 60 116 190 200 117 74 36	Wonder if that bird has food?
36	29 187 135 95 51 11 161 45 139 167 36	Why are there two flower girls in a wedding?
36	185 197 117 13 50 3 21 56 141 147 36	Why does that women have two drinks

36	53 18 167 124 87 200 133 214 168 15 36	Why is there a cage-like grate behind them? Are they in prison? What did they do?
36	200 67 139 6 146 68 49 19 150 91 36	What kind of game is going on
36	26 9 215 169 3 33 54 14 160 172 36	What building is that
36	23 34 151 57 183 33 10 159 62 92 36	I'm not really sure what she is smiling about.
36	203 51 123 81 54 168 70 183 56 2 36	What is that object
36	179 78 212 166 56 51 194 126 199 187 36	Who created this?
36	24 77 113 108 150 146 78 88 37 109 36	Wonder where this is?
36	84 12 153 47 27 181 125 186 121 1 36	Where am I? What is going on? Are those white things rocket boosters?
36	157 26 130 158 148 87 43 49 94 120 36	Why even are all of these colors here?
36	130 195 83 17 18 138 135 215 66 145 36	Do I want to see the leg or the dog more?
36	148 204 10 41 104 100 164 166 94 29 36	I wonder if this is in Italy.
36	75 104 166 52 164 136 67 187 10 113 36	Who is this guy?
36	162 147 32 128 167 22 211 192 187 134 36	Is this a tree she's sat next to often?
36	4 9 67 72 183 187 160 51 104 97 36	Why is that man so tall.
36	103 111 212 112 50 174 45 85 97 145 36	I wonder where this was taken
36	173 17 129 128 136 24 156 181 112 180 36	How did we get here?
36	34 163 85 169 29 30 146 125 91 142 36	She honestly doesn't look happy with him, I can tell just by looking at her eyes.
36	214 175 102 120 115 162 114 94 45 180 36	What color is that, exactly?
36	118 109 204 117 214 213 208 17 136 135 36	I wonder how that squirrel got here
36	200 51 156 46 190 82 186 106 147 194 36	Does he even know how to pitch a tent?
36	76 92 214 145 174 91 122 85 203 47 36	is that there son?

36	115 138 45 143 153 149 145 44 30 165 36	What is he looking at?
36	201 140 57 162 171 65 132 165 168 63 36	Why is the background so stark and barren?
36	71 166 201 162 2 70 73 202 183 192 36	Why is this purple? Why is it this shade of purple?
36	173 144 86 200 190 84 85 90 33 142 36	I wonder if they use those terrible pesticides in this park?
36	117 177 139 58 152 149 70 140 142 183 36	Where is this pool?
36	148 154 79 205 2 124 194 198 201 145 36	Are you sure?
36	90 208 115 146 1 2 41 187 105 122 36	What color is this?
36	98 148 48 37 31 26 32 85 108 1 36	Why was I not invited to this event?  It seems fun.
36	113 46 165 199 115 204 167 193 64 139 36	What's the deal with the stars?
36	59 54 172 3 103 130 138 70 140 210 36	Haven't seen these two together in a long time.  I wonder if they're back together?
36	170 144 177 50 20 121 206 63 155 28 36	The green the pool maker choose for the bottom color is too dark I think.
36	190 69 80 98 202 205 196 75 32 10 36	What type of aircraft is that?
36	202 125 77 7 86 122 153 191 35 24 36	But why is he making that god awful face?
36	65 152 209 41 133 89 100 35 186 162 36	They look to be playing a game. What game? What are the rules?
36	182 215 125 186 50 38 120 48 20 13 36	I wonder where all those pipes go to.
36	206 79 199 51 166 86 91 124 61 13 36	The massive undertaking of light
36	40 35 111 153 200 158 76 16 128 68 36	I don't know where this is, is this an event?
36	215 51 18 60 25 134 84 161 196 145 36	where does such beauty come from?
36	98 105 13 163 139 2 11 199 197 93 36	He may be the teacher, but how do we know that he knows what he's talking about?
36	186 67 173 108 161 215 181 3 119 214 36	I wonder how deep the water is here
36	195 111 34 170 152 95 129 22 158 38 36	What is she doing? Is it cold? Who is taking the picture?
36	57 179 75 159 153 37 46 66 158 152 36	Interesting, is that a good read?
36	129 130 86 53 211 154 79 20 112 164 36	I wonder what they're drinking?
36	181 195 91 3 54 17 208 205 153 191 36	I wonder if those dogs think they are going to drive that moped?
36	158 11 16 103 149 120 70 212 213 87 36	What in the world is that?!
36	199 10 121 137 17 25 78 100 82 131 36	I wonder what this history is of this tower.
36	109 143 187 199 61 9 133 144 40 26 36	Why is that weird car on the grass?
36	162 142 65 130 45 6 73 196 144 172 36	Why don't people every respect the beauty of this beach? Every day I clean up trash left by visitors.
36	32 125 182 39 104 102 31 112 38 105 36	What is the meaning of this?
36	196 8 64 70 119 156 146 90 163 138 36	Why the hell the table is empty.
36	109 28 184 33 144 180 173 38 157 188 36	Why would someone take a picture from a window ledge like that?
36	138 154 178 206 200 183 100 157 48 149 36	Why take a shot of an empty balcony?
36	45 167 198 139 44 23 24 29 125 212 36	I wonder how many people drowned in that water?
36	18 180 96 202 45 10 13 120 196 25 36	Why did you take a picture of these random people?
36	86 109 197 174 215 19 88 15 214 177 36	This color makes me inquisitive.
36	73 56 124 152 129 39 160 10 107 92 36	why the picture is blur? may be its dolphin!
36	120 92 32 136 141 87 71 99 66 144 36	nice picture of this young female
36	107 61 11 12 185 120 146 75 6 179 36	I have always been uncomfortable with the military mindset. Blind faith in your leaders can get you killed.
36	8 187 159 27 180 196 38 48 179 132 36	Where are the sheets? Where are the pillow cases? Why is the bed unmade? Are there bedbugs?!?!?
36	116 66 158 168 118 194 93 96 103 13 36	IS she a Dallas Cowboy cheerleader reject? What is she wearing?!?
36	105 32 77 173 40 92 211 100 51 47 36	I don't understand why people get pets and then abanden them.
36	92 176 64 184 63 190 56 35 166 58 36	I wonder where that is...
36	141 83 188 47 60 34 64 102 23 3 36	Are they a band?
36	165 111 64 92 159 60 124 94 205 65 36	Wouldn't the mic be more effective UNDER the cymbal?
36	82 52 64 75 169 121 88 21 110 32 36	Is this a performance? A game show? A celebrity lip sync? Who knows?
36	31 151 101 17 24 215 121 119 169 59 36	Where is this? Why are there no people on the sidewalk?
36	209 106 196 85 107 24 204 113 82 92 36	What do you suppose that document is for?
36	1 179 5 194 59 89 215 186 50 95 36	Is she eating in an office? Why?
36	152 123 145 166 187 49 207 170 109 182 36	I wonder what type of flower this is.
36	192 53 31 125 21 167 66 83 174 126 36	What is the special occasion?
36	65 171 27 113 159 151 64 206 28 82 36	Wait, they don't have machines to do this?
36	71 107 3 173 100 80 72 127 153 126 36	What are they aiming at?
36	6 174 110 200 7 123 25 143 181 190 36	I wonder if these plants are poisonous, I shouldn't bring my dog in here.
36	26 205 171 213 174 58 84 132 14 168 36	Why is that light so bright?
36	120 94 4 27 191 73 205 18 117 204 36	What is he doing here?
36	197 135 72 89 67 186 31 85 105 173 36	Why did he feel the need to make a cart out of that?
36	150 52 96 198 170 203 129 64 31 63 36	Where is the mother?
36	158 74 38 140 88 65 106 2 198 143 36	I wonder how many seeds each of these fruit has.

36	189 125 196 132 51 163 84 105 46 180 36	Is my relative on this list?
36	134 136 203 93 118 184 32 37 174 185 36	What could those people possibly have in common to pose together like that
36	200 214 154 124 198 10 14 201 34 64 36	Youngsters in a dark area having a few drinks, I hope they are staying out of trouble
36	182 128 177 34 81 154 45 15 10 150 36	How much would this cost?
36	142 162 22 158 109 195 67 145 215 150 36	What are these guys up to?

36	11 176 135 52 213 32 182 4 87 50 36	That style of building seems an odd fit with it's surroundings.
36	42 150 77 189 98 214 118 194 165 94 36	Is he flying in the air?
36	144 136 92 215 156 63 112 197 10 37 36	Why on earth is she running through the wilderness?
36	96 183 1 6 193 39 114 12 51 4 36	What is this
36	19 151 11 21 85 86 15 106 30 156 36	Why does that sign say local earth?

36	140 83 95 200 194 38 79 123 171 202 36	What are those things that look like boxes?
36	180 124 91 199 65 11 73 145 6 147 36	Who are you even looking at?
36	93 29 40 129 173 166 137 68 52 190 36	I wonder what kind of detergent they use in the car wash.
36	13 19 142 202 164 32 114 130 50 47 36	What is this red sand coloured picture all about as I really can't tell.
36	191 57 142 127 111 27 175 33 18 203 36	Its puzzling what these footballers are trying to do
36	88 53 186 207 190 215 70 209 71 105 36	What's with the cheesy frame?
36	209 78 37 32 133 189 185 77 176 30 36	sunny, open, classic
36	163 131 100 134 209 213 190 214 179 158 36	Are those really their cats?
36	67 43 101 158 130 177 125 90 15 13 36	What is she staring at?
36	132 75 76 168 33 100 17 119 215 193 36	is that the caddie?
36	96 89 45 184 196 123 172 124 69 143 36	Is that a functional plane?
36	116 154 119 160 190 166 83 215 135 148 36	I wonder if the beer garden really is to the right?
36	80 26 173 212 101 207 107 197 16 196 36	What are those?
36	55 42 15 30 96 75 50 19 24 103 36	The broad clear sky
36	161 2 110 53 87 83 18 159 201 11 36	Where can I book an appointment? This looks like a great space.
36	59 136 98 84 87 41 123 150 97 50 36	Where could this place be. Is it somewhere in Africa?
36	123 180 60 70 118 200 89 24 137 25 36	Why does his face look like that; is he reading something funny?
36	14 106 49 102 181 118 187 1 31 189 36	Wonder why it drooped like that.
36	187 9 11 104 196 89 16 211 90 114 36	Maybe they would have won if they were not so busy hugging
36	155 28 170 186 77 104 30 24 50 76 36	Is that part of an engine?
36	39 28 62 95 148 71 191 49 40 186 36	what does that building mean
36	201 55 112 110 92 120 130 6 141 32 36	Do you think they are twins?
36	211 129 196 146 190 69 193 73 180 26 36	I am not sure this is a good thing to touch.
36	212 73 109 175 180 205 178 139 13 116 36	What's going on here?
36	151 92 141 7 30 113 18 23 171 103 36	That drink might not be good for him.
36	181 44 60 90 58 85 25 153 12 33 36	A glass table with a cord?
36	114 195 13 83 109 186 177 175 21 6 36	But why are they making those silly faces?
36	177 21 16 173 93 82 56 184 43 34 36	Where in the dessert it was taken?
36	138 50 174 60 136 139 189 187 74 203 36	What's their reason for being here?
36	20 98 38 19 16 171 170 168 205 134 36	Do they even know how to play?
36	100 12 88 200 21 115 67 183 209 130 36	I wonder what the architect was thinking when he desgned this?
36	215 118 62 197 33 131 120 42 159 214 36	Does she really know this guy?
36	31 170 7 203 164 206 163 53 28 92 36	Where is that at? Looks like a High School.
36	100 188 151 71 77 114 208 101 38 62 36	Is she getting married?
36	203 167 81 57 212 6 186 154 197 13 36	Um what is going on here?
36	22 49 118 102 58 103 104 74 122 14 36	Why are the doves in the water and not with the doves on the road?
36	212 42 76 59 89 48 63 188 173 138 36	What on earth are these guys up to?
36	121 201 109 161 170 66 13 88 47 77 36	What is she feeding him?
36	115 77 80 200 199 5 111 106 2 96 36	Some treasure in the boxes
36	128 54 25 15 205 132 60 164 26 212 36	Beautiful and majestic place
36	127 149 45 134 74 195 193 22 76 4 36	Is this man a sound engineer? Is he an air traffic controller? I'd like to know.
36	77 53 146 87 34 101 118 138 173 168 36	I wonder if this is on TV?
36	94 71 120 82 161 159 105 209 107 208 36	why is he staring like that
37	141 197 14 114 70 94 60 164 186 119 37	ghastly, grim, terrible
37	168 59 76 142 50 11 30 162 169 203 37	This restaurant has such a grisly decor
37	12 155 96 127 61 195 11 8 23 156 37	Look at all those animals!
37	134 21 188 126 215 206 133 80 117 199 37	Death may find you in the dark.
37	80 139 174 64 29 65 190 78 40 177 37	You may see animal or human bones in these woods.
37	134 157 169 50 115 200 26 44 142 190 37	Hard to not capture the police in a photo any more.
37	118 137 102 184 164 8 176 177 210 74 37	All things like this will perish one day.
37	152 60 188 190 38 72 40 23 168 115 37	This looks like a prison
37	122 202 163 21 139 13 172 132 194 26 37	The joy on this lasses face only makes me think of my lack of said emotion, and my impending death.
37	40 138 92 113 99 191 144 38 46 168 37	Katie won't do very well I don't think.
37	39 28 176 130 211 129 81 71 68 198 37	If these people drink all of that alcohol, they'll probably die from liver disease one day.
37	2 154 138 175 72 156 139 151 176 88 37	This was my fathers favorite car before he died in an accident
37	179 85 60 111 3 197 62 147 139 46 37	It looks like someone died here, such an abandoned place.
37	33 103 76 150 19 111 13 159 155 172 37	Next up in first place of the obituary.
37	181 32 103 104 90 55 154 213 147 187 37	This place looks very ugly
37	168 179 82 149 45 36 85 181 24 77 37	Hope no one dies here
37	146 18 117 88 50 147 172 113 159 85 37	i find it so disgusting a man has to talk in front fo a room cull of poeple
37	173 165 27 99 20 1 18 25 180 3 37	A different kind of bike
37	15 86 44 30 74 29 115 14 68 41 37	He's going to blow so hard, he's going to drop to dead.
37	16 17 88 40 181 120 79 108 214 213 37	Every time I hand out with this guy I get really sad because he talks about his sick child.
37	11 67 62 117 43 96 31 183 124 24 37	the end of an era
37	135 24 76 81 13 187 123 145 18 15 37	He's thinking about everyone in their underwear.
37	42 29 18 22 68 46 199 43 5 78 37	They don't look very healthy...
37	105 172 46 60 24 53 110 8 12 108 37	That women should die soon.
37	198 184 106 206 88 117 142 70 209 112 37	drowning, cold, freezing
37	129 188 210 62 200 33 171 151 109 29 37	looks like a gloomy day
37	198 161 41 118 12 52 6 69 84 195 37	That marriage wont last long
37	13 117 129 25 78 109 70 84 150 89 37	I hope this man is able to beat his terrible disease, but it is not looking good.
37	67 192 127 156 170 212 135 70 116 201 37	This is the color of my blood after a day of being dead.
37	94 202 183 167 78 19 26 47 92 10 37	The ritual celebrates the solemn past of the town.
37	182 181 172 19 91 113 66 86 49 126 37	Looks like the cabin from a horror movie
37	114 1 128 41 88 23 46 166 169 85 37	Those kids are dressed like orderlies in an asylum.
37	84 145 153 167 186 71 170 30 14 151 37	Why bother playing?  In 100 years no one will remember you anyways.
37	59 24 104 31 173 107 21 63 183 85 37	This wood mouse is dead like me
37	17 200 91 197 9 209 23 149 84 144 37	An empty road
37	42 21 13 90 120 174 4 183 206 101 37	It's amazing to think how quickly it could all end.
37	133 96 18 202 5 164 179 6 213 79 37	He will probably be dead soon, from his injuries. But so will we all.
37	192 68 110 66 27 21 61 28 131 142 37	Wow, that guy could suffer a career-ending injury with that move. He might even die.
37	59 26 125 186 80 88 48 98 118 172 37	Her singing makes me feel as if my head is going to explode!
37	109 93 16 54 107 154 96 43 145 75 37	She's going to die soon if she doesn't start eating right and working out. A bloated, morbidly obese corpse found fused to her chair, a bag of pork rinds in hand.
37	33 176 87 118 52 12 204 53 24 50 37	There is a serial killer waiting in their house.
37	129 23 209 24 26 201 113 67 156 17 37	Butterflies are scary animals up close, plus they like to eat each other like most of its cannibalistic brothers.
37	27 60 133 96 11 211 119 29 75 99 37	Roads are the place of many's death
37	207 174 199 201 24 78 135 22 109 98 37	That does not look appetizing.
37	175 3 143 171 117 147 8 159 96 140 37	Hopefully not the scene of another school shooting.
37	120 85 72 202 151 201 68 185 131 128 37	I don't see how someone could risk their life to street race.
37	6 199 163 169 55 138 162 81 85 31 37	Green is the color of death
37	90 193 115 72 97 127 213 149 140 157 37	This looks like a perfect place to bury a body.
37	82 128 76 63 152 124 182 1 98 141 37	That looks like what a car crash victim would see before they died..
37	90 38 188 150 141 177 103 209 99 139 37	person unwanted life
37	97 17 10 137 43 101 165 183 163 12 37	Looks like the color of a bloated body.
37	180 31 212 213 63 192 99 116 106 91 37	These guy will killed by a drunk driver after this photo was taken.
37	186 120 123 167 180 144 161 58 119 184 37	This color reminds me of the sweet release of death.
37	4 44 164 201 146 52 69 117 181 36 37	If someone falls from this level they would probably crack their scull and die.
37	52 123 135 202 103 181 62 101 121 119 37	I wonder how many people have died there.
37	24 81 155 15 201 96 104 42 192 129 37	Imagine all the violence this photo has seen.
37	55 126 143 28 23 13 71 87 27 85 37	That picture look slike death.
37	11 34 145 172 15 133 85 63 182 14 37	They're all gonna be dead soon anyways.
37	112 104 47 75 74 85 214 38 17 41 37	This is the statue of David and he's dead.
37	23 199 159 92 85 51 62 192 74 69 37	That is so dangerous, the dog could get electrocuted.
37	58 183 28 104 77 140 180 70 14 30 37	I bet that food is full of worms.
37	86 110 89 55 123 188 184 118 8 23 37	What a shame it would be if they fell into that fountain behind them and didn't know how to swim.
37	16 126 141 139 57 196 127 110 117 25 37	Monsanto? He looks suspicious.
37	136 114 165 20 27 207 124 123 196 25 37	And he sang of the rotting of flesh and human pain.
37	31 139 79 162 95 184 147 34 165 20 37	I hope this is not someone's suicide note.
37	40 163 109 2 101 82 159 29 198 13 37	Wow I hope that doesn't fall all on anyone
37	61 174 214 51 129 17 122 209 185 111 37	This kind of looks like a tower you'd see in a cemetery
37	6 131 3 122 87 214 157 118 141 165 37	Something is off,where are people in this concert?
37	63 211 7 177 32 57 4 132 144 5 37	The water they're swimming in is probably so filthy they will get ill from it.
37	33 139 114 76 164 117 190 168 208 160 37	Your body will be mangled if you fall.
37	87 34 53 194 92 111 145 96 19 176 37	Purple is one of the colors of death.
37	63 149 66 145 154 143 92 27 89 99 37	This is an ugly display.
37	12 212 118 102 189 95 124 72 45 79 37	If I kill one of them and bury them will they ever find them.
37	42 173 74 127 209 103 125 172 66 87 37	These are the wheels of the bus that used to go round and round, until they drove off the cliff.
37	174 39 91 117 15 69 144 32 151 16 37	Here lies the decease body of Juan Salau
37	122 140 163 189 76 113 162 111 34 130 37	These people all died after this.
37	57 193 173 80 183 148 134 88 94 196 37	such a dreary day I wish the flowers would just die already
37	211 177 77 11 128 55 206 153 48 71 37	Must be a dead persons belongings
37	209 212 12 97 199 141 75 39 70 130 37	How many people have jumped?
37	177 45 41 161 149 208 49 131 124 196 37	This was left behind after the murder.
37	182 44 202 71 153 100 121 69 181 112 37	Reminds me of an old Indian cemetery that's about to be dug up.
37	199 68 141 207 209 135 84 159 181 171 37	This cake looks like a dismembered body.
37	53 183 140 122 117 48 17 15 146 112 37	The ash is all that is left of the body.
37	67 156 100 46 32 212 20 55 75 185 37	How many children could you drown here?
37	134 127 104 110 41 108 122 143 107 204 37	I bet theyre all dead by now
37	169 95 146 183 215 100 60 111 209 202 37	She may die here
37	45 200 144 96 24 192 27 195 185 16 37	Looks like the fence outside of a slaughterhouse.
37	6 15 195 98 159 145 55 193 125 81 37	I wonder how many people jumped off that roof.
37	204 38 66 82 32 174 61 49 63 52 37	I wonder how many dead bodies would fit in that vat.
37	63 190 16 67 140 139 70 176 171 96 37	The end of the day is a death of the day.
37	57 128 190 162 214 152 103 126 85 99 37	bus, travel, people
37	14 177 105 48 124 90 83 149 205 63 37	I wonder if there is a dead body in there.
37	46 38 143 208 6 10 87 93 85 173 37	Another end of the day signals a death of a day.
37	214 5 197 83 85 155 105 103 111 168 37	I don't know if these are stars or the aftermath of a wrestling match.
37	79 73 135 203 69 152 185 28 21 142 37	Sadly those flowers will wither in time as all things ever created. That's the pitty of it all.
37	184 92 207 89 63 14 74 69 83 66 37	Ugh this just reminds me of dying of old age.
37	26 81 198 83 33 158 139 186 72 152 37	This looks like a horrible game.
37	143 96 163 35 12 212 85 64 130 11 37	I hope they aren't poisoned.
37	12 131 148 151 24 68 125 40 171 156 37	The child in the right corner looks similar to special effects in movies used to show a cursed child. If you look closely you will see the lines are an example of damage from this curse causing the once child to break into pieces. No one else can see it and continues to live happy lives. They will soon find out but it will be too late.
37	30 122 19 201 107 56 27 128 20 90 37	Death stalks her.
37	43 64 124 153 191 52 196 34 181 95 37	I want to kill that dog statue.
37	206 87 196 183 135 132 177 60 78 108 37	University-produced honey; that truly spells doom for our local farmers.
37	9 112 1 40 178 149 120 208 176 109 37	Cute kid, but please be careful with the chain on that swing
37	24 61 197 165 75 83 182 141 201 36 37	She is probably dead
37	196 12 177 108 9 13 10 26 125 161 37	The runner in third later in the race dropped death from a heart attack.
37	166 92 203 154 115 54 11 43 214 40 37	Dead bodies are dumbed in that water every day.
37	74 14 68 116 104 49 67 71 201 144 37	This looks like the clear day that a serial killer would choose new victims.
37	120 122 151 40 115 149 136 61 15 171 37	It's so sad to know that this baby is still missing.
37	156 215 41 66 86 99 191 183 30 135 37	Is he about to fall off his bike?
37	147 27 191 11 70 39 164 130 45 4 37	This mans and horses heart is as black as their shadow.
37	24 106 59 81 121 195 98 172 183 94 37	I hope the red on his face isnt a disease
37	36 170 24 61 196 45 67 180 148 72 37	This lake has dead bodies in it.
37	212 204 197 213 196 144 60 82 80 114 37	Why would someone keep taxidermy dogs around their couch?
37	118 144 115 3 2 43 42 197 202 155 37	Anyone climbing that tree will fall to their deaths
37	160 89 109 27 209 122 192 49 213 73 37	The snow will not stop until it buries this city.
37	86 98 30 150 173 148 42 100 186 174 37	Records are a dead technology.
37	96 50 118 155 76 138 184 207 42 48 37	They all contacted the avian flu from being so close together at the event and died three days later.
37	16 112 29 125 106 2 151 22 182 129 37	This is before this store died. I wonder if rats live here now.
37	39 127 149 84 178 169 42 206 166 121 37	Are we sure Biras is not a Freek?
37	44 108 210 159 17 168 202 135 64 124 37	Let's eat thet all
37	172 105 22 54 129 91 42 139 194 53 37	He's gonna get ran over
37	11 103 58 135 15 155 214 47 77 188 37	If I were there I'd just end it all and jump into the water.
37	201 84 86 124 6 189 156 35 176 210 37	I wonder how many of the people in this photo are dead.
37	120 100 16 185 178 46 137 124 199 215 37	This picture looks peaceful, but so many people have died in this place that they've lost count.
37	165 18 214 5 135 25 21 40 55 95 37	This would be a horrible place to die.
37	4 10 110 185 7 212 42 26 125 142 37	The dog's stare is blank and unresponsive.
37	123 134 166 9 67 162 151 204 139 15 37	That is just a colorful death trap.
37	6 39 77 139 11 62 74 59 211 25 37	Why did the chicken cross the road? It did not, it got hit.
37	106 121 29 143 196 167 53 49 170 64 37	This reminds me of death, darkness with flashes of images, that you cannot quite make out. But the background to it all being the abyss of darkness and death.
37	124 142 66 168 204 192 195 172 122 141 37	Coyotes again.  Hide your pets.  They killed two of my cats already.
37	111 13 119 202 108 17 12 158 194 197 37	This desert does not look appealing.
37	210 185 174 124 146 177 89 168 58 46 37	They deserve to die for their crimes.
37	116 66 4 59 38 209 1 145 103 107 37	i bet this creature has lost his partner
37	39 114 138 131 25 166 1 161 64 157 37	The deadly lotus, poisonous to animals, as I found out after my sweet Rover ate one last year.
37	180 18 194 46 214 78 83 85 119 9 37	This is a deadly building.
37	53 41 97 188 109 54 191 202 151 96 37	I wonder if the people on the grass will be eaten alive by fire ants.
37	135 15 191 130 107 101 146 66 140 142 37	We don't want anyone to die so keep you life jackets on
37	117 115 161 106 118 56 174 142 190 2 37	Talk now, for the gates of oblivion haunt your very existence.
37	59 184 29 86 136 202 17 137 53 25 37	I'd die of claustrophobia in that crowd.
37	198 86 115 101 89 144 2 210 156 5 37	That statue should be knocked down and burned
37	195 46 114 151 212 159 105 169 202 56 37	That women is wearing warm clothes in summer.
37	73 193 11 191 174 29 10 51 76 46 37	I remember her so well, it's like she didn't die last week and she's still here with us. If I go and collect her corpse, I wonder if it can be revived?
37	164 90 179 191 63 51 190 194 26 160 37	They're probably talking about cancer.
37	23 203 38 52 150 180 16 127 197 71 37	Ugh I hope all the people on that flight won't die in a plane crash.
37	98 24 143 40 110 23 12 106 148 200 37	It is very bad to keep horses in captivity, horses need an open field.
37	82 47 203 206 97 65 78 95 162 161 37	No doubt someone dropped a dead body here.
37	41 163 122 3 200 208 148 24 29 144 37	hes probably drunk
37	164 29 65 190 68 28 105 75 207 148 37	they all left the dog to die
37	81 122 28 84 180 207 144 158 55 190 37	This kitty is looking for his first kill.
37	125 11 119 152 32 205 85 167 113 23 37	I wish they would just die already.
37	18 77 85 100 15 39 16 185 165 34 37	I'm sure a lot of people have died here. Maybe even some animals.
37	13 74 200 104 51 107 114 147 194 47 37	This is the exact moment where he has renal failure and dies from blood loss.
37	194 156 132 192 212 175 169 72 87 207 37	I wonder how many bodies are in the water.
37	76 135 16 45 169 69 8 134 142 210 37	He's probably looking up at the anvil about to fall on his head.
37	199 178 48 202 97 214 91 162 16 41 37	She should have all the fun she can with the kids.  She will die soon.
37	68 63 26 207 44 152 8 153 149 134 37	What would make this even better is if she had black tear streaks coming down her face.
37	141 140 76 11 110 209 124 186 159 106 37	She sees dead people.
37	90 35 154 19 205 21 47 162 105 161 37	Effigies build nothing but hate and contempt and can lead to murder
37	111 34 24 164 187 19 66 182 142 171 37	The pretty baby could be in a grave.
37	15 181 160 110 151 9 145 140 21 82 37	That fresh dirt is where the bodies are hidden.
37	203 93 122 211 63 188 101 174 27 87 37	hope another player tackles him and he gets injured
37	142 157 87 119 90 194 103 146 7 13 37	Those flowers have red speckles on them, maybe from the blood of hummingbirds that stop to visit them.
37	210 92 65 132 93 184 201 79 135 76 37	Perhaps the camera caught an animal dying
37	20 11 162 76 182 159 17 199 139 192 37	He died an hour later from a drug overdose.
37	110 14 177 135 5 204 22 136 36 48 37	There are about ten deaths a day from drowning in the US.
37	102 109 178 177 40 58 134 5 8 48 37	Maybe we will find a dead body along the train tracks.
37	106 96 147 62 163 124 91 76 206 134 37	We put some pink roses like that on my gran's grave.
37	199 20 209 213 146 9 80 176 72 182 37	If you broke a bulb, you would get electrocuted and die.
37	99 3 10 214 43 200 16 183 7 89 37	The people who drank the first beer to have been poured from these barrels are probably dead by now.
37	173 64 201 129 35 75 87 172 186 53 37	She died three days later
37	91 1 185 139 155 133 98 54 176 80 37	Police violence is real
37	214 15 171 212 139 70 59 8 17 162 37	If I see this much purple again I'm going to off myself.
37	132 98 14 199 45 59 120 39 104 186 37	ONE lady for that many kids?
37	60 139 124 184 127 200 74 39 34 130 37	He will one day be worm food.
37	70 59 116 112 28 103 80 64 16 54 37	This man looks like he is having a fun time, I hope nothing bad happened to him.
37	79 201 144 182 84 68 156 72 169 204 37	They will one day see their end.
37	29 197 32 44 42 133 115 31 206 68 37	A military enforcement
37	206 50 205 108 187 122 1 11 214 198 37	Their babies probably get eaten by lions and other predators every day.
37	97 103 161 91 178 23 186 182 13 12 37	They have so much makeup on that they look like corpses.
37	175 131 30 60 107 48 100 116 8 64 37	I really like the gray color in this picture
37	159 129 93 120 180 4 165 130 126 28 37	Most fatal skiing accidents happen in the dark when no one is around to hear you scream.
37	20 139 60 117 83 113 96 128 132 181 37	I hope someone falls on this title in hurts them self
37	39 164 124 204 35 45 17 14 196 146 37	I want to burn down this horrible looking theater.
37	95 67 100 48 180 215 23 176 163 126 37	I heard that serial killers take their victims here.
37	194 204 54 136 173 73 196 151 211 150 37	I bet when she dies the worms are going to be feasting for years.
37	179 195 7 152 92 212 101 141 97 9 37	They put a flower in my tea cup.
37	127 93 156 75 113 67 145 17 27 176 37	Is that a casket for a gerbil?
38	39 182 81 61 154 189 23 116 78 76 38	Why isn't the water rolling off? Is there glue on there?
38	97 99 160 75 105 34 41 177 43 77 38	Why is there a random building here?
38	34 119 139 117 102 141 81 106 88 98 38	How do I turn it?
38	99 59 107 7 93 31 164 83 8 199 38	I'm unsure if that's a mirror or sculpture?
38	49 99 194 103 98 89 205 53 75 30 38	Why would museums be on the web? I wouldn't visit that.
38	95 74 181 5 199 102 60 179 152 93 38	I don't understand - why would you grow plants like that in your garden?!
38	143 81 60 88 211 178 200 140 67 82 38	What is that on the wall?
38	203 33 69 153 129 168 59 35 147 164 38	what shoes am i wearing today
38	119 128 193 99 32 58 150 158 205 22 38	I did not understand what this was about.
38	45 4 79 39 193 206 127 16 173 148 38	Wait is this a real forest or art? I can't tell.
38	78 85 32 181 154 206 212 99 203 7 38	Wait? what?I turned all the lights off
38	165 50 48 21 205 29 93 35 158 121 38	Why would his parents let him do this?
38	133 109 136 17 174 192 118 117 33 94 38	Is this a hens night?
38	145 4 109 135 81 139 65 175 212 177 38	what is that statue?
38	8 88 42 73 95 134 151 76 146 140 38	Is that Pinocchio? But he's on wooden blocks? I don't understand why he's standing there.
38	109 93 84 36 192 11 47 190 147 87 38	I'm not sure if these are musicians or this is karaoke.
38	173 9 109 119 148 13 159 52 50 177 38	I thought he was the equipment manager..
38	191 180 67 139 199 175 18 90 20 98 38	Why am i looking at this?
38	26 121 67 192 107 128 57 34 12 161 38	What a nice color
38	156 8 206 48 68 102 210 91 153 124 38	I wonder what mountain range this is
38	24 25 19 46 130 7 209 94 17 36 38	What is he drinking from that cup? Why is the other guy smirking so much?
38	154 185 41 113 47 178 159 37 133 116 38	I am not sure where this restaurant got the idea to go for a boat theme.  It started as a normal sports bar.
38	67 62 160 130 60 140 9 184 196 113 38	I wonder what he's doing
38	74 36 172 185 127 83 171 87 37 85 38	Sometimes I am conflicted about my favorite color, but then I remember purple.
38	156 161 93 21 132 17 133 183 121 178 38	I've never seen this park before.
38	37 78 183 180 135 181 121 192 41 105 38	Why does he look so cheerful at a funeral?
38	146 118 199 101 60 33 97 96 94 113 38	I'm not sure what I'm looking at here. Is that supposed to be a bridge in the distance?
38	62 15 43 6 17 182 60 172 200 171 38	I cannot comprehend how a person actually fits in there.
38	178 153 13 54 176 162 127 175 22 137 38	Is that Andy or Ted in the pic?
38	189 164 123 57 144 136 139 147 39 185 38	It puzzles me how the train works
38	60 90 126 33 30 182 171 70 40 140 38	It is very hard to watch children play soccer because they often have no real gameplan tied to their movement.
38	201 53 207 47 20 152 173 59 177 35 38	I'm wondering where the drain pipe is?
38	148 84 139 154 159 91 45 12 137 173 38	Is that a house or a church?
38	47 159 100 22 118 44 149 174 133 12 38	How did he get there
38	59 8 61 141 154 190 185 204 150 69 38	Our friend was not sure she was at the correct party. She didn't recognize anyone!
38	125 152 18 62 144 9 53 104 56 198 38	I am not sure if this is wrestling or a roller derby.
38	129 147 52 208 70 173 108 119 140 53 38	Like, is the boat coming or going, I don't get it.
38	40 78 30 27 45 169 64 170 132 141 38	I am not sure what is going on here.
38	103 178 195 84 2 205 214 17 14 202 38	Not really sure whats going on here? Is the rope bridge leading to a fenced off tree? Whats that about?
38	91 5 31 189 75 21 179 204 137 191 38	I wonder who decided it was a good idea to give him a tiara
38	40 21 208 75 125 121 109 62 100 11 38	How come there is only one flower?
38	162 128 206 118 170 178 65 182 3 119 38	The monkey is under the water.
38	47 183 36 211 34 180 121 66 165 187 38	Is the child a boy or girl?
38	9 46 77 20 209 199 107 62 121 58 38	I sometimes wonder why people ware helmets when just riding there bikes in the subdivision.
38	207 179 191 199 37 132 146 10 54 35 38	Why do we only see their feet and legs
38	6 139 103 142 53 31 150 85 193 165 38	I don't understand what I'm looking at.
38	56 40 148 182 49 138 29 10 112 94 38	This is the fanciest McDonald's I've ever seen.
38	15 64 83 92 183 178 95 35 104 118 38	What is that in the sky
38	113 181 96 22 9 27 16 167 185 32 38	What are the people celebrating
38	159 70 191 67 122 117 165 6 145 200 38	What is the man doing
38	172 87 185 144 23 100 104 212 177 110 38	Is that some kind of bicycle or something?
38	119 180 174 61 83 25 208 157 186 90 38	why even are you blue?
38	42 5 21 121 58 206 29 205 13 119 38	Why is she running backwards?
38	90 194 187 53 68 129 165 96 175 213 38	This boy doesn't have a team? Why won't a team sign the boy?
38	207 144 65 118 166 181 107 52 55 11 38	Is this a painted ceiling reflecting on... floodwaters?
38	60 64 136 72 13 27 50 80 45 133 38	Wait what are they doing?
38	118 40 139 4 61 159 27 162 53 58 38	Is this a happy or sad event? Hard to tell.
38	41 201 116 130 202 154 10 185 151 49 38	I do not know where I am
38	168 71 7 6 166 26 127 153 213 10 38	Is this a coin or some kind of shield?
38	187 61 183 94 113 215 213 95 211 181 38	I don't get it. How do they get the fountain in the water?
38	171 142 54 64 206 202 65 117 176 40 38	A scriplet note

38	213 187 11 24 203 184 115 8 167 51 38	This could be an image of optical fibres, or it might be some modern art work, but then again it could be laser beams.
38	200 132 21 203 162 30 74 202 46 189 38	I'm not sure I know what I'm seeing here.

39	185 160 6 183 196 102 135 115 116 58 39	It does not make sense to live here
39	36 98 58 74 4 141 145 164 83 152 39	Seeing a green bird is always a sign that you'll have a bad day.
39	77 156 10 187 155 68 60 125 129 142 39	Wow I bet this car has enough horsepower to win a NASCAR race!
39	16 185 85 156 192 30 23 75 92 187 39	I should slide down the table and slap every man sitting there.
39	101 195 83 63 162 118 127 10 14 48 39	They are a really terrible team.
39	118 40 119 184 56 22 67 31 96 58 39	It just ridiculous to put your head this close to another person, head lice anyone.
39	61 182 113 34 58 123 132 213 8 94 39	Illogical time to work
39	6 160 203 106 174 69 122 101 185 142 39	It is not rational to sit the entire game
39	4 104 59 9 123 105 58 211 55 190 39	This game seems baseless
39	71 206 108 81 97 210 196 114 182 143 39	The mother looks on in disbelief at the fathers groundless claims
39	25 84 74 202 134 167 35 118 153 159 39	Take some sushi with you so you can give it to me after your flight!
39	203 4 176 68 175 117 197 114 149 90 39	I hate this color. It reminds me of urine
39	139 17 103 200 93 34 111 193 29 194 39	This building is haunted! Don't ask me why, I just know! I can sense it.
39	55 32 159 182 35 112 138 117 140 21 39	They give me a blank canvas with no pencil.
39	115 156 199 187 42 26 134 215 35 94 39	Weddings are all terrible.
39	70 134 198 206 44 173 114 13 33 155 39	strawberries are the worst fruit!
39	166 215 79 121 208 158 89 167 165 81 39	I'm sure they'd play even in the rain, crazy.
39	74 141 160 178 169 167 105 205 127 86 39	Wow, those people over there in the corner are going to come running at me at any moment!
39	79 80 155 37 168 138 47 211 181 96 39	I have no idea what they're trying to do here, but it looks like they're failing to me.
39	74 90 177 127 204 19 97 200 102 79 39	The backgorund light is making me crazy
39	88 181 111 38 116 100 184 64 25 35 39	That vehicle will probably be crushed by the building!
39	126 45 160 75 8 94 147 80 107 86 39	Would thesthesde darn car get off my fricking road!!
39	183 196 76 53 180 161 115 120 74 69 39	She's going to try eating that.
39	69 60 41 95 208 87 178 75 104 164 39	Is this for customers that need to wait? I don't see why they would have to wait on the top rack.
39	73 185 116 174 123 146 165 50 153 148 39	lets jump in the gcar and make a get awayu
39	18 188 93 27 49 54 95 153 157 47 39	What why is the chair in plastic?
39	104 105 71 64 203 201 168 124 57 173 39	books that is yet to be read
39	159 3 209 185 46 155 169 188 29 202 39	Why is he laughing, I bet nobody else is.
39	16 3 27 64 167 215 166 109 165 213 39	This place will never sell. No one wants to live here
39	116 179 107 110 57 85 182 125 19 22 39	Those people on the lift are going to plummet to their death! the worse always happens and too many innocent lives will come to an end because of it!
39	4 98 139 157 10 202 145 83 90 129 39	If the food is just sitting there like that, it must be free.
39	124 198 200 87 207 208 24 151 139 165 39	this isnt a buckeyes house
39	168 79 143 55 177 146 73 50 195 53 39	That camera looks dull
39	93 109 69 17 65 53 186 125 128 143 39	That dog has a really short tail
39	44 129 18 203 153 189 115 165 191 114 39	It is not possi ble for me to come there in these heels
39	12 192 148 11 188 165 158 156 7 199 39	If you try hard enough you should be able to have the place cleared out within a few hours.
39	199 23 28 132 71 55 197 95 118 47 39	Why is she drinking beer in the middle of winter?
39	51 81 14 108 4 137 60 32 86 83 39	That giant rat better not escape or it might destroy those little buildings in the background.
39	102 180 5 89 130 158 52 42 146 7 39	I could swim out to those rocks. The current is strong but I am a stronger swimmer.
39	99 15 132 41 113 168 47 67 96 166 39	Are they going to a Harry Potter convention?
39	209 8 170 155 48 189 7 101 134 143 39	What are these idiots smiling at?
39	208 6 22 43 53 46 31 174 19 45 39	This ladies make up looks like whoa amateur style
39	108 31 166 125 74 79 179 30 93 149 39	It's not healthy to wear that metal so close to the skin like that.
39	128 17 194 163 160 212 154 48 98 158 39	Did this guy use too much laundry detergent?
39	5 82 166 58 151 148 86 56 197 10 39	She should buy some fireworks.
39	143 25 58 108 34 211 18 42 69 49 39	A beautiful zone
39	10 2 199 158 178 21 130 162 68 108 39	Are these kids getting ready for motorcross or what?  Why do they need all that gear to play hockey?
39	11 131 15 59 147 35 196 37 161 76 39	I bet this has never been touched
39	127 124 98 16 2 193 103 130 44 92 39	Why are these guys sitting there doing nothing? They should be working instead of protesting.
39	143 169 195 2 167 52 68 116 123 172 39	Is there more than one Superman?
39	148 188 12 103 115 192 156 108 1 146 39	Those people should watch out!  Those cars behind them are likely to run them over if they're not careful
39	115 132 72 22 69 157 112 4 118 197 39	that's not a piece of paper. It is book being that she looks puzzled.
39	76 2 93 199 95 169 181 158 102 53 39	This is just stupid
39	147 153 22 44 37 140 36 29 176 21 39	This is not such a beautiful flower.
39	203 45 189 100 167 127 76 208 143 13 39	What kind of revolution are we talking here, the Che type or other?
39	94 131 171 69 200 113 56 129 99 182 39	It's very strange that someone decided to chisel these strange rock formations in the way that they did.
39	82 160 76 111 126 12 127 167 46 156 39	Let's do a wheely!
39	46 52 76 18 65 95 33 108 185 84 39	Why didn't they finish their legs.
39	3 139 42 198 128 126 97 137 146 202 39	Why am I doing this!
39	99 12 209 29 129 42 169 152 190 72 39	next play is for a touchdow
39	13 1 163 87 43 58 35 200 208 15 39	That's so ugly. I don't get it.
39	22 132 114 168 10 127 182 5 116 62 39	What is the deal with these statues anyways?
39	58 203 90 169 133 88 8 114 148 184 39	I would so jump from one of these lifts.
39	207 43 2 128 120 52 172 92 144 71 39	He is going to hit her!
39	98 161 65 212 20 115 198 74 130 145 39	This looks like a prison cell.
39	210 99 141 203 22 71 164 95 33 198 39	She can stare all day but the painting will not move.
39	12 183 64 207 79 177 38 161 108 209 39	AHHHH, fire bad!  Fire bad!!
39	168 127 111 205 134 92 175 166 37 176 39	Um, drive-in concession? Rest room?
39	173 144 43 150 48 16 132 128 146 136 39	Crazy thoughts are clearly going through this bird's mind.
39	44 49 69 163 149 117 192 194 153 65 39	I would paint those fork lifts pink
39	176 81 91 70 20 122 134 112 127 100 39	This schedule is way too hard to read. There should be a city employee at each stop who can tell you when the next bus is coming and where it's going to.
39	200 162 100 21 16 211 20 7 94 197 39	I could live out here in the snow with no heating or house!
39	70 86 67 62 208 103 69 150 156 133 39	Stop clipping! These poor animals deserve the self respect of keeping what's given to them by nature
39	100 47 112 129 31 35 45 55 7 80 39	the best place to hear this will be the very back row
39	201 132 209 104 85 191 90 89 23 198 39	Seems like a perfectly good place to put that.
39	109 41 14 148 115 106 25 133 159 189 39	These people are dangerous!
39	36 12 174 46 54 31 58 151 62 63 39	Is that a little boy? or a girl?
39	148 87 24 46 131 124 97 19 193 92 39	It is ilogic to think about a race where the woman in white wins.
39	196 32 144 156 99 171 1 128 71 18 39	Why do the flowers no match the table cloth, let alone the flash is shown on the wall in the photo?
39	194 10 145 134 91 148 171 117 94 188 39	I dont think thats an accurtate scene.
39	166 141 80 174 25 8 119 5 17 117 39	I don't care why you need them, it's silly to load the front of the boat with buckets of rocks!
39	128 129 59 67 201 49 65 195 13 167 39	I could learn that sport in a day.
39	156 85 189 138 142 188 125 119 117 174 39	How many people can you fit up there?
39	115 129 213 28 73 69 191 206 65 124 39	This bridge can transform into a monster!
39	14 123 64 159 11 166 18 62 139 85 39	He is flying in the air!
39	103 7 127 57 157 211 165 100 174 163 39	That little kid is plotting something...
39	60 109 64 90 44 137 13 80 174 136 39	He has no good reason to be on the beach.
39	65 35 154 2 178 152 135 176 99 198 39	The toys are illogical when we grow up, seriously I don't like toys!
39	34 69 84 141 96 162 161 40 49 75 39	There are monsters in there!
39	36 69 92 4 158 17 89 166 79 24 39	Those are evil fireworks!
39	173 201 118 69 192 127 175 174 18 68 39	This blanket is evil.
39	163 30 47 40 27 55 62 16 36 33 39	I bet that I can run aross the beams while the train goes by.
39	88 28 97 113 208 179 73 13 168 165 39	After this concert, let's blow all our money on drugs and booze! Who cares about paying the rent fee.
39	186 31 6 184 43 46 123 156 164 86 39	Another small town with scenery destroyed by modern conveniences like electricity.
39	164 215 151 159 48 36 176 88 100 96 39	What if the snow prevents ambulances from getting to the houses?
39	163 148 46 120 122 35 26 100 45 187 39	I HATE it when buildings touch the sky like that!
39	131 188 105 177 20 55 197 24 31 36 39	Those are some Halloween decorations.
39	108 170 182 151 106 149 129 130 42 208 39	Those kids should be at work.
39	2 96 187 116 173 72 9 127 64 194 39	This building is going to fall soon.
39	182 44 119 20 123 70 117 87 210 74 39	How does a design like this hold together. Looks like it could collapse at any moment!
39	77 171 13 207 74 193 175 33 28 149 39	I think that you could use that as a giant hamster wheels and just run forever.
39	205 108 166 118 133 143 36 202 59 186 39	That cliff looks like the perfect place to live!
39	181 175 143 86 123 47 98 201 78 155 39	This Audi is evil.
39	11 18 2 67 16 168 156 48 121 124 39	This is all wrong!
39	103 15 99 78 192 148 188 211 88 9 39	That duck shouldn't be in the water
39	52 76 119 138 55 195 84 104 159 42 39	What a nasty family.
39	113 40 165 185 59 149 173 152 26 51 39	That toy can read my thoughts.
39	19 215 18 91 33 115 124 55 212 204 39	Why is this statue there.
39	175 101 32 28 139 63 86 30 150 129 39	This picture is upside down
39	52 30 136 124 83 64 51 128 155 60 39	A really good camera must have taken this.
39	71 40 213 100 77 29 81 192 4 49 39	A singers posture
39	49 121 165 123 76 10 132 141 169 61 39	Many places to go maybe we can fly to the moon.
39	17 106 21 213 57 66 166 212 159 30 39	Looks like they are wasting flowers.  It doesn't matter if it's a funeral procession.
39	89 93 139 170 201 146 140 124 209 76 39	I should be able to explore the entire city in a day or two
39	111 199 55 19 148 119 58 86 68 1 39	She is a hologram!
39	171 117 58 189 125 67 72 76 210 157 39	This kid is trying to kick that girl.
39	100 23 184 101 88 78 59 163 65 177 39	I just don't understand how this helps anyone anywhere
39	105 187 103 198 77 35 48 55 92 154 39	They are there solving the world. talking to a better tomorrow...
39	58 153 17 47 50 139 6 96 210 126 39	Seems like a waste to build a gate when people can just walk around the sides.
39	146 145 167 22 182 147 165 7 183 131 39	Is this a bosun box or an umbrella anchor?
39	185 93 60 140 41 178 187 159 59 154 39	This lady doesn't seem to be listening to the other one.
39	139 186 166 8 36 171 90 117 15 136 39	What are you running from? Your responsibilities?
39	43 83 3 190 64 161 198 124 46 47 39	She's probably going to get sea sick reading on the water
39	49 110 91 123 183 154 151 1 46 96 39	These old looking bridges always make me feel uneasy when I cross them.
39	161 32 66 166 95 99 96 117 183 121 39	I think this house should be leveled due to the bushes not being trimmed.
39	4 127 161 37 38 80 114 162 66 214 39	Don't take it all
39	67 11 104 215 86 134 72 107 181 115 39	Someone should jump off those rocks into the pool.
39	80 88 134 116 167 104 176 172 180 158 39	This looks like a comfortable place for a human to sleep.
39	215 158 214 163 208 11 203 172 196 159 39	I bet this place is full of demons.
39	197 94 37 88 167 154 119 44 23 69 39	I'm afraid this guy is starting a cult
39	45 136 27 31 100 166 206 133 63 181 39	I just think they could have built it a little sturdier.
39	32 94 124 177 185 202 211 104 76 55 39	I could probably build something like that in a week.
39	149 205 27 129 51 47 188 171 80 108 39	This wave is going to destroy the planet in a giant swoop.
39	1 52 192 162 159 54 104 155 99 145 39	This building will fly away today.
39	74 62 176 17 204 118 147 54 200 109 39	That could be an alien species that is going to invade the earth!
39	215 90 44 45 82 75 25 202 175 24 39	These two must be headed for work, if you look carefully you can see they are downbeat about the long day ahead.
39	151 12 170 172 89 183 150 154 169 17 39	this image is so over the top and revolting. if this was on my wall , i think it would make me pass out.
39	51 152 31 5 104 29 101 114 87 197 39	What is she doing?he looks like a man with a dress on,very unreasonable
39	109 65 120 95 86 51 85 78 117 96 39	I don't know what kind of insect would sit on a flower like that
39	58 131 144 190 212 182 16 208 106 174 39	The world is coming to an end!
39	128 78 113 14 190 61 126 19 13 81 39	Let's go surfing here.
39	96 24 71 170 171 127 215 76 31 32 39	I think hes going the wrong way
39	144 145 160 75 204 186 181 54 205 60 39	Just because it's cold outside shouldn't mean this girl can't coordinate her clothing.
39	111 184 174 172 50 189 73 104 69 126 39	This art was made by devils.
39	131 166 19 183 87 62 154 215 128 81 39	My Suicide!? Like my dog would want to commit suicide!
39	198 15 101 95 121 134 192 165 159 36 39	I don't think this is true, it doesn't look real to me.
39	86 214 56 90 185 65 209 194 94 24 39	I'd never go up their the spikes are too sharp
39	174 131 89 8 200 36 153 119 24 107 39	The old battle machines powerful than new ones! I am sure.
39	129 158 149 38 92 68 156 202 98 29 39	A hungry waitress
39	177 94 14 56 181 132 7 131 166 112 39	They are having a party outside and dance floor will be the garage doorway.
39	210 65 165 90 120 17 187 136 155 154 39	Can't they make the river clearer?
39	203 52 83 161 153 19 205 56 155 1 39	Hang on, it's gonna fall!
39	108 191 135 192 143 207 151 206 104 42 39	I can see pokies
39	150 130 177 189 53 16 97 45 46 42 39	I don't know what type of insect this is, but it scares me a lot.
39	144 177 152 120 61 203 12 17 21 78 39	Who cares about this little taco bell.
39	154 105 33 215 79 143 69 191 202 4 39	His hair must be so dirty!
39	27 144 132 155 127 8 19 34 118 102 39	A place to jump off.
39	94 145 192 161 154 140 62 115 18 170 39	To drive a canoe down this would be absolutely wild.
39	125 139 153 196 60 36 204 46 48 133 39	this a work place
39	142 187 92 36 109 82 176 159 93 49 39	Cars shouldn't even have plates. Its just big brother keeping tabs on us.
39	30 92 88 63 84 64 38 43 68 52 39	I will swim in this during the winter and won't get cold at all.
39	23 188 73 79 159 60 89 145 143 80 39	That bridge is going to collapse
39	213 48 73 40 91 173 16 94 46 18 39	Those are daisy's right?
39	60 23 156 102 33 187 106 66 108 152 39	I think this thing comes to life at night and steals apples.
39	111 176 49 82 146 203 188 59 47 29 39	I just don't know about this guy!
39	33 58 43 1 190 13 37 137 173 151 39	Trains are so dangerous
39	136 165 166 83 10 178 37 87 20 209 39	Oh, no no no no no, you touched my camera. Stay 10 ft away at all times.
39	172 144 142 174 181 57 95 157 162 205 39	That car is coming for me. I can't avoid it.
40	34 153 21 61 117 97 29 129 30 142 40	The view is so remote
40	21 183 9 61 46 35 174 22 54 201 40	I'm not sure if a literate sadist set the scene, or if I need to grab my sword.
40	8 149 31 171 21 97 130 99 141 159 40	Kids having fun.
40	92 74 46 35 76 134 33 38 121 147 40	Why does it look like chinese writing?
40	192 44 94 159 121 17 179 86 64 83 40	It's a wall.
40	17 74 7 16 186 67 174 21 92 45 40	this track looks personal not impersonal
40	163 87 196 108 140 186 89 199 70 148 40	The girl is not very personal
40	6 167 135 57 67 122 104 166 181 27 40	This looks like it could be entertaining.
40	173 55 157 129 200 65 210 3 167 110 40	The couple is very shut off to the world
40	74 54 180 73 64 146 153 17 121 90 40	walking through the stone ages
40	124 25 21 139 23 46 205 208 77 29 40	It looks like that man is on the phone..
40	54 3 202 148 149 203 163 199 193 141 40	So that is a etch n sketch.
40	48 106 174 18 4 99 183 176 62 64 40	stop winking at me
40	109 184 46 80 191 159 91 26 215 138 40	Who takes the ferry? I've never been on it.
40	16 81 192 177 115 50 76 185 166 8 40	I don't care who wins
40	58 146 41 103 60 53 93 135 139 207 40	What a machine.
40	67 183 100 36 76 33 214 102 185 20 40	I went to this wedding.
40	139 154 193 132 74 89 179 105 212 114 40	This is a good spot for a neighborhood cookout.
40	101 100 201 85 188 163 105 94 121 180 40	This is a legible sign.
40	14 74 37 49 11 115 64 144 130 10 40	That background could be described as blah
40	20 119 113 85 131 10 79 98 45 196 40	What a boring view. I could take it or leave it.
40	181 204 139 212 60 172 142 10 38 141 40	If he doesn't close his latch, he's going to have a dry mouth.
40	200 52 181 10 139 2 148 119 91 18 40	It seems impractical to spend money making streetcars festive.
40	215 61 149 185 156 93 168 120 66 203 40	Unbiased cave artwork
40	213 116 66 19 70 75 29 129 95 103 40	The flowers in this photo are beautiful like me.
40	196 5 182 125 34 140 57 60 11 118 40	Interesting picture. Nice filter
40	213 118 152 207 135 103 143 12 24 32 40	Enjoy your celebration.
40	83 38 23 92 48 7 134 215 191 170 40	This ornament was made for a decoration contest many years ago.
40	197 138 174 32 123 38 56 191 18 192 40	This random gentleman has a nice horse.
40	26 81 172 158 35 37 214 207 171 143 40	What does the writing mean on the red and white flag?
40	127 15 185 99 128 55 202 160 41 195 40	Why are these people all here.
40	113 186 134 187 85 137 35 107 202 6 40	These men are looking some photography images in a gallery.
40	192 175 165 52 92 182 35 55 213 173 40	Spiders have a lot of eyes and just as many legs.
40	166 6 12 50 69 81 136 106 115 170 40	Guns are popular in the south.
40	214 53 139 60 14 146 46 13 32 184 40	The view is unbia
40	58 109 21 68 95 78 116 171 161 208 40	The police vehicle is so plain
40	124 140 181 122 187 152 157 203 201 116 40	They're protesting something it seems.
40	68 92 20 170 186 133 214 124 169 24 40	Trees are growing all over, they need to be cut.
40	185 32 94 159 194 58 1 128 200 31 40	Those dogs looked bored
40	63 149 41 142 59 104 81 201 109 50 40	This butterfly looks kind of cool.
40	121 184 143 1 181 55 46 193 178 25 40	theres priests all over the world
40	197 165 79 211 55 212 27 149 37 1 40	Roller derbies are NOT my thing.
40	161 65 54 135 13 144 179 170 17 64 40	No one is speaking to anyone else in the crowded room.
40	178 84 179 175 48 120 119 180 134 75 40	Green is not my favorite color.
40	103 178 111 29 196 100 169 185 59 213 40	Oh fireworks, nice.
40	214 154 111 19 104 25 11 126 210 64 40	Water and boats, with some clouds in the background. It looks like a sunny day.
40	204 180 52 201 178 22 163 114 48 165 40	Choices, choices, choices.
40	155 133 166 14 9 167 208 85 23 163 40	Its the color purple
40	85 185 96 212 14 103 31 152 56 112 40	The view is dark
40	180 108 178 159 181 185 146 165 149 77 40	she is not looking at me
40	61 200 118 149 206 8 100 36 89 120 40	Those are heels
40	146 89 188 85 128 151 78 31 119 115 40	Seen one sunset you've seen them all.
40	148 144 202 146 52 76 21 56 111 128 40	The man is sitting down
40	199 78 87 49 107 161 6 148 106 130 40	I never did figure out who the artifact first belonged to.
40	92 26 137 63 125 215 27 29 65 32 40	Typical city roads, empty and quiet.
40	77 60 135 185 184 21 25 53 96 153 40	None of my business what she's doing as long as she seems happy.
40	7 185 69 44 128 170 2 54 175 56 40	There intentions make me not want to buy the bike.
40	41 115 122 101 149 138 65 181 139 35 40	As if I care about a friend chicken dinner.
40	87 55 84 212 38 109 171 158 101 19 40	Lights at night
40	117 212 32 93 24 88 201 156 160 148 40	Just a park
40	60 82 68 122 212 165 206 195 87 133 40	That is a big field.
40	154 177 51 69 174 24 78 92 107 163 40	Always with these guys.
40	94 61 159 210 25 163 213 84 112 194 40	That painting was made by an artist
40	79 8 76 16 94 146 186 68 14 214 40	Trains are so boring.
40	24 6 111 45 107 115 136 48 162 4 40	Beautiful red flower that looks like it has just bloomed
40	125 156 27 193 38 4 175 106 88 126 40	Clouds seem so bland
40	182 80 15 105 39 175 81 189 28 131 40	I see some random woman.
40	204 67 203 108 65 71 47 68 177 113 40	She's looking at more important things.
40	43 200 34 19 61 82 106 208 62 109 40	I love seals.
40	79 25 31 191 172 167 37 105 129 41 40	i dont understand what they are doing
40	181 111 133 200 202 107 174 101 194 59 40	Lots of people make model tanks.
40	209 119 212 53 28 121 48 24 57 12 40	These baby booties are very colorful.
40	106 128 146 47 184 36 57 211 23 122 40	The referee should  be unbiased on this game,free and fair game
40	106 64 198 173 200 27 189 182 132 16 40	His colleague is tthe next speaker.
40	57 183 207 156 49 83 25 212 114 76 40	i don't care what happens yesterday
40	151 215 177 102 18 22 52 141 49 87 40	This is a rude horse.
40	32 64 174 85 38 115 4 86 78 169 40	I have never been here.
40	151 109 197 97 84 136 95 75 60 212 40	Musician playing music.
40	18 35 67 68 102 99 156 8 188 75 40	Girls playing derby somewhere.
40	93 212 152 52 106 97 195 205 78 135 40	This food looks bad.
40	182 206 63 200 208 1 30 209 3 69 40	What is this thing right here?
40	100 36 171 208 70 105 180 86 12 116 40	Wow this is great.
40	179 31 3 65 183 144 204 155 26 137 40	wonder what they are doing?
40	159 103 153 34 178 74 33 144 94 197 40	What's that in the background?
40	164 78 142 202 179 160 94 147 107 98 40	The people are sitting around a table.
40	56 193 74 194 163 80 54 204 145 64 40	Why does she have two peace signs up? She only needs one.
40	15 79 114 178 104 37 44 143 82 58 40	These two wood people are holding buckets.
40	13 46 67 36 132 4 83 90 11 183 40	310 feet of copper
40	58 149 107 16 134 147 157 166 160 71 40	can't even tell what this is supposed to be somone should at least try to make an effort.
40	158 177 124 194 62 18 76 171 58 137 40	Who cares what's in this photo?!
40	44 178 179 142 210 60 171 57 52 163 40	It's so weird to me that famous people take pictures with strangers, seems so fake.
40	174 183 60 172 185 138 70 25 127 167 40	Alot of people and walls.
40	80 56 183 65 152 115 192 12 156 132 40	To say nothing of one's feeling toward the photo itself, the cold, clean, sterile lines of this building stand out most.
40	51 111 105 212 97 82 56 99 14 130 40	Very cool sculpture!
40	176 183 123 69 162 148 106 68 97 109 40	These signs are here for a reason.
40	15 206 212 12 94 66 30 37 176 4 40	I might like plants.
40	187 83 196 33 190 3 148 215 168 157 40	This is a nice image. The text is inspirational, I guess.
40	48 81 176 149 79 18 46 17 38 70 40	Where's the rest of the rainbow?
40	151 88 153 22 146 144 84 122 30 24 40	I am not sure what this kid is going to do with those tools.
40	81 72 181 48 76 163 148 55 6 94 40	The clock struck noon but I could care less...
40	166 156 62 21 45 17 117 27 48 152 40	His other shirt features che guevara
40	36 41 84 129 62 165 141 43 94 104 40	This dinner looks ok.
40	188 34 124 115 43 137 138 195 129 73 40	This could be us
40	28 137 30 105 122 74 171 132 1 72 40	Only one of the turtles has a shadow.
40	72 24 109 53 41 129 69 202 63 170 40	i feel something is weird
40	19 89 145 10 156 142 162 68 38 138 40	I don't care for this ramp.
40	92 178 180 47 10 45 99 177 55 146 40	This dog just wants to go elsewhere.
40	101 198 150 39 105 86 145 126 191 74 40	This was not done with care
40	127 169 212 121 117 151 187 147 164 123 40	What a goofy outfit.
40	2 1 38 196 151 35 185 148 61 30 40	very nice architecture
40	113 54 174 43 169 18 142 151 45 149 40	I would not feel like talking to any of those people
40	196 177 105 68 72 175 14 101 31 129 40	I can hardly tell what's going on. I guess this is supposed to be a concert?
40	163 55 91 157 186 118 69 3 169 79 40	That's a cool 4 wheeler.
40	81 90 147 109 88 183 2 98 59 69 40	I'm really not like to do this. It is not me...
40	36 14 119 35 104 61 163 41 206 84 40	That dress is nice.
40	186 213 183 205 19 120 174 98 106 208 40	That's an okay statue I guess.  Nothing really fancy here.
40	196 176 82 150 114 172 208 192 127 146 40	I wouldn't care to ride in one of those.
40	125 118 181 60 190 100 210 214 146 161 40	That art is okay.
40	30 51 114 135 41 25 118 207 132 192 40	That looks boring.
40	51 3 60 204 128 16 167 141 20 84 40	The lettering on the wall is nice.
40	56 4 70 68 193 212 1 154 196 192 40	He's standing in between two paintings.
40	169 72 139 67 208 6 7 58 146 21 40	That is a gross tent.
40	67 103 145 152 82 214 121 128 190 209 40	Look at these lumps.
40	174 66 43 25 3 9 150 48 186 193 40	This lady is boring.
40	211 12 198 119 188 46 36 44 116 11 40	So silly walking in this weather.
40	175 181 196 90 104 42 26 30 162 97 40	They look boring.
40	4 131 97 141 51 208 203 148 119 188 40	Just another animal having fun.
40	35 62 26 114 186 25 29 12 211 142 40	This process will probably fail if it is established.
40	145 5 15 60 206 159 214 205 1 215 40	I know they're people, but I really can't feel too close to them, especially through a photo.
40	126 161 147 123 4 60 154 54 118 2 40	The crowd is way too much.  I would want to get out of there and alone.
40	210 10 139 145 17 205 28 213 115 8 40	I don't think she worked very hard to get her spot on the billboard.
40	70 87 44 122 123 185 104 99 113 160 40	I feel nothing for this plant.
40	95 59 53 98 37 33 135 81 209 103 40	We should just destroy this bridge, it isn't helping anything.
40	24 106 52 10 104 101 29 83 31 58 40	Another food dish made by a no body.
40	150 64 45 137 209 75 118 111 76 21 40	The water is being cycled.
40	108 106 189 46 113 128 32 35 209 165 40	i have this color in a room in my house
40	20 39 116 151 110 201 4 7 67 91 40	The trees on the hill need to be cleared to create more ski trails.
40	5 82 121 100 35 206 24 84 105 176 40	Not something I really want to do
40	24 94 121 195 3 67 36 77 178 181 40	I don't understand the perspective here
40	182 213 35 70 125 83 52 20 171 41 40	I'm not sure what's going on with that skirt.
40	83 89 55 156 27 207 9 140 105 62 40	A night at the fraternity house is never dull.
40	135 145 68 127 162 45 173 190 208 17 40	She looks like she is busy so that's okay that she can't hang out, nothing personal.
40	141 2 88 113 103 143 91 164 202 119 40	Looks like an intense forest
40	95 109 75 9 53 100 199 134 154 101 40	black and white water fountain
40	106 136 94 97 62 102 174 36 112 65 40	Is this another stock photo of siblings?
40	90 28 157 155 137 100 131 198 64 52 40	Same old thing
40	202 205 65 50 141 140 20 83 101 207 40	All cars are the same just different colors
40	14 38 49 92 97 91 62 142 47 162 40	This is a car of someone's.
40	14 56 20 5 116 33 39 79 21 58 40	Interesting sign, somewhere green.
40	154 192 98 89 210 159 12 61 174 131 40	Murano glass, just another way to take a tourist's money.
40	30 33 145 143 202 37 23 22 26 67 40	Seems like a good dude, but I really don't know him so I can't really bring in those feelings to really know that.
40	122 103 26 181 15 72 16 192 61 170 40	I would've played on my phone this entire show.
40	1 51 177 145 162 91 213 23 136 128 40	That is an amusing sign.
40	63 179 121 156 21 129 32 114 158 137 40	Loads of tourists visit that castle.
40	184 147 104 167 91 26 199 1 97 127 40	I wonder how long ago "Sanford" carved that in there.
40	130 75 60 159 202 166 5 69 1 33 40	Is he tilling up new plants or planting them? I can't tell and I don't care.
40	151 93 137 176 89 172 78 104 59 37 40	I guess those two much be on a trip.
40	75 46 109 168 99 147 155 35 121 42 40	so where is this?
40	68 97 107 13 31 47 202 139 121 147 40	I really don't care about what i'm doing.
40	118 188 139 104 214 50 197 210 36 213 40	It's just an old family map of our property.
40	131 201 179 42 46 202 9 184 122 103 40	I hope the champagne is suitably cold.
40	165 158 123 113 201 186 46 49 212 100 40	That's a cat
40	77 145 78 128 29 73 157 192 189 27 40	Men often dress in pants when playing the guitar.
40	48 104 149 32 208 2 145 98 134 15 40	A quaint, but, unimpressive, room.
40	186 148 60 177 12 145 120 140 67 202 40	That mask behind the glass is strange.
40	157 17 114 154 124 93 109 11 82 169 40	This is a mountain, thats all.
40	209 23 144 71 107 141 173 167 120 54 40	My Mississippi my home town
40	208 189 145 171 68 126 35 203 37 114 40	Not my generation.
40	207 208 54 87 22 120 173 195 135 213 40	More cat photos for the internet of course.
40	195 72 123 146 147 203 140 144 53 78 40	it's just another road
40	189 90 171 210 145 136 215 74 20 72 40	they are poor
40	207 121 187 31 84 69 158 58 27 192 40	This picture is of a stranger and her even stranger baby.
40	80 110 203 199 159 153 86 196 214 50 40	A sign to reunite families
40	120 165 196 100 190 61 10 78 96 52 40	I would so steal that bike.
40	104 149 118 23 116 36 89 211 21 109 40	I think it looks okay.
40	8 144 152 174 63 135 171 70 96 200 40	Don't know who that is but it doesn't really matter to me
40	54 131 141 169 209 179 25 43 109 211 40	Been there, done that. Next
40	179 5 199 41 33 192 195 119 24 39 40	This isn't about you , it's about the map.
40	166 22 5 82 48 191 211 117 126 19 40	I don't even know her.
40	187 167 19 83 13 69 170 15 95 46 40	I wonder who she is.  No time to meet her though.
40	90 212 102 45 126 178 118 7 196 65 40	Is that hers?
40	182 29 76 33 169 114 177 28 66 178 40	What's the big deal?  It's a building.
40	25 59 133 137 3 37 32 88 160 1 40	That man is throwing a spear
40	56 11 126 151 29 149 133 157 92 33 40	Bikers that looks to be competing.
40	183 155 77 184 62 130 192 104 115 2 40	I hate the trees. Take me to a city
40	135 20 56 16 81 188 190 97 41 145 40	The colors are there.
40	95 58 213 35 14 189 104 142 91 80 40	I bet it's smelly in there
40	26 191 59 29 20 2 37 146 39 9 40	This could be anyone's yard - nothing special
40	19 30 112 66 180 164 155 37 22 190 40	The target is approaching point B.
40	104 57 42 51 151 182 197 60 54 121 40	The railing suggests you should hold it, but horses ran those narrow walls.
40	138 215 102 105 100 18 84 66 181 163 40	If I was on the offensive line I would plow right through everyone. I don't even care if I hurt them.
41	194 82 89 209 38 56 2 96 138 196 41	Not very good
41	91 51 148 117 199 143 46 119 49 123 41	walkin in to a demon den
41	165 106 94 47 21 160 215 198 86 136 41	I think the girl in the picture is Asian
41	210 77 28 87 74 73 51 147 171 163 41	What are ruins, really?
41	46 193 109 25 172 35 189 150 14 212 41	Eh looks gross
41	198 181 69 70 210 191 212 173 133 169 41	The building is hard to see haha
41	5 104 155 201 161 98 141 124 54 175 41	I hope they have time.
41	68 213 185 31 115 174 56 92 158 77 41	I remember a thingy like that.
41	47 193 67 1 65 152 85 29 96 137 41	I like greenery.
41	22 175 95 167 178 173 113 7 141 81 41	This could be algae or cells of some sort under a microscope
41	153 56 81 85 13 155 80 43 133 91 41	I wonder what this graffiti is depicting.
41	201 33 99 35 152 54 83 132 46 135 41	Is this a time machine?
41	151 141 38 90 135 199 54 57 21 71 41	The color of the van is not decided yet
41	196 78 121 99 20 87 113 96 69 31 41	That's a cool area.
41	213 32 3 9 81 140 88 36 171 50 41	I don’t really know what all these people are waiting on or where this is.
41	119 205 117 96 171 27 47 94 39 26 41	There must be a reason for that thing on the floor
41	30 62 54 117 153 127 24 199 57 194 41	That mask is over her mouth for a good, important reason.
41	179 95 169 215 13 211 113 64 209 194 41	They're running a race.
41	40 199 143 33 11 128 185 31 207 141 41	Captivating style of the flora, especially for the region
41	159 127 182 16 164 59 147 110 103 53 41	He won something.
41	4 18 146 161 125 148 69 27 28 48 41	a European city
41	5 122 76 129 26 66 87 205 56 100 41	Her speech is very direct.
41	190 193 23 123 208 11 188 47 87 56 41	Those girls are...special.
41	86 153 21 165 135 205 75 3 173 107 41	Fun party supplies.
41	40 8 16 161 54 107 139 33 208 3 41	This location might be Asia. It has trees and water. It's not the U.S.
41	204 167 185 101 64 97 144 14 108 21 41	This looks like something I would make
41	73 21 63 1 186 140 109 65 181 177 41	Looks like a successful business deal
41	97 17 200 158 1 58 184 14 170 206 41	I guess the water is nice today.
41	42 131 171 143 73 37 161 137 33 139 41	Darkness borders a single beam of light.
41	183 107 187 135 68 181 21 51 81 177 41	Of to visit!
41	80 191 215 49 111 181 194 25 145 193 41	I need this.
41	10 21 156 174 172 152 204 163 56 84 41	not quite sure here
41	130 132 51 98 35 135 205 58 2 154 41	these are people
41	157 59 47 23 42 191 50 103 189 40 41	yellow an dblue houes
41	16 57 81 86 51 91 105 211 39 215 41	Spur of the moment nap...
41	70 31 96 154 79 85 150 59 118 98 41	A great place to perform, rock or indie maybe.
41	159 20 109 167 207 49 118 113 6 30 41	Looks like a thing is happening here, of some sort. On bikes and with little hats.
41	165 182 138 168 95 57 61 171 73 79 41	This is one of the places I went yesterday.
41	158 49 103 90 172 3 19 185 136 95 41	What a strange group of people.
41	127 13 208 179 128 11 112 189 177 105 41	I can't tell if this is a highway or a building.
41	105 213 185 92 193 142 56 5 16 204 41	Well I would say let her go but she deserves it.
41	61 182 55 173 36 23 29 188 144 79 41	These guys are chilling.
41	174 183 190 101 48 196 27 151 197 90 41	This cliff doesn't look super familar.
41	103 97 91 213 101 191 108 215 22 210 41	Where are the restrooms, I have to pee
41	156 40 180 34 67 206 30 125 130 166 41	Let's get some pizza
41	17 58 59 105 192 205 26 165 154 60 41	Its a fish!
41	19 141 208 51 152 35 134 196 200 40 41	Well, guess they had a good time that night haha.
41	159 177 168 63 30 96 186 12 115 81 41	Oh a lovely flower of some type.
41	53 31 166 125 100 14 85 29 86 170 41	This is an animal.
41	31 36 209 66 65 49 90 60 1 122 41	I would feel the exact same way as him, if I was up there.
41	194 135 88 150 9 155 4 106 112 202 41	This is nature.
41	157 158 116 117 35 130 148 151 159 65 41	these pieces represent some part of ancient culture
41	133 76 158 160 79 29 140 207 198 127 41	THe people are hugging
41	152 59 156 6 178 25 154 194 73 23 41	This is...interesting.
41	183 146 195 74 164 181 85 130 47 87 41	The vase can hold many things.
41	213 57 212 168 53 84 69 38 21 112 41	Everything is purple in this nightclub.
41	128 136 69 182 56 152 211 210 54 61 41	These are fruits growing on a tree.
41	197 205 64 209 204 39 189 54 86 74 41	Could be a memorial.
41	184 20 101 122 97 203 64 155 27 95 41	There's a dog in a field. The end.
41	70 102 66 115 201 148 136 208 196 56 41	He sings like my heart feels.
41	31 212 12 98 167 152 24 8 102 159 41	Its a castle
41	68 73 192 214 11 8 125 209 201 165 41	These people are hanging out or something.
41	169 48 12 40 70 116 155 189 23 149 41	There is so much happening below the sea.
41	148 144 82 89 147 205 17 36 90 145 41	It was at this exact moment a surprise would somehow enter into their life.
41	155 197 50 105 184 62 94 131 114 163 41	Eat are eating, that is one thing for sure.
41	32 46 91 123 2 49 192 12 165 10 41	Are these like tourists on the bench?
41	115 71 46 24 92 64 4 166 18 30 41	This statue is old.
41	87 143 55 180 7 83 70 116 191 77 41	It looks nice.
41	156 82 20 178 5 131 28 157 204 29 41	some musicians are really very unclear to understand
41	68 34 107 89 27 93 180 165 40 167 41	The bug is moving or is staying put.
41	140 131 110 143 115 121 32 105 116 18 41	thats a rock
41	31 80 17 196 6 124 168 20 215 183 41	well, that's a dark space, isn't it?
41	37 19 30 2 114 180 207 91 68 99 41	Some sort of alcohol? Beer maybe?
41	50 90 52 113 171 149 208 94 196 151 41	I am curious what the reason is for the gathering on the field.
41	207 135 215 202 65 22 90 29 23 51 41	Tree girls in the image.
41	49 1 8 24 212 95 117 166 184 44 41	She is lost in thought.
41	139 52 96 137 6 158 162 12 54 40 41	Girls playing sports
41	112 33 52 60 145 199 130 90 136 146 41	This is a metal structure.
41	161 206 205 20 167 1 138 51 166 119 41	The odd couple.
41	51 178 26 177 93 208 75 113 48 150 41	This is a picture of snow at a location.
41	169 177 146 87 90 18 35 65 50 88 41	Those are like fireworks.
41	107 143 145 112 116 35 171 30 3 10 41	There is a boat in this picture, It sails on water.
41	119 68 74 98 58 201 129 176 195 144 41	This is a parade.
41	133 172 141 58 131 67 168 174 129 31 41	great pic! are you ok?
41	9 119 13 195 172 135 147 118 191 144 41	When I have wings one day, I will dream and go back to sleep then flight.
41	48 179 96 92 93 43 132 157 45 91 41	What nice coloring.
41	4 178 35 51 47 206 150 95 81 13 41	This is a group of people who are sitting around
41	202 119 42 157 62 21 155 145 131 154 41	Crowded room, fancy food.
41	156 89 98 76 121 42 120 202 196 145 41	Look it is those guys we met in that place...
41	207 15 181 55 18 46 179 87 157 71 41	This art picture is a little on the abstract side.
41	144 183 7 43 166 101 211 5 71 32 41	I wonder what he is thinking.

41	18 21 204 1 27 45 67 189 68 195 41	A woman sings to an audience.
41	210 44 16 110 146 94 64 36 126 89 41	That's my favorite color.
41	179 77 16 156 206 145 166 128 170 107 41	I think it might be a holiday.
41	92 167 129 71 105 166 63 154 141 102 41	A person is playing that game.
41	125 11 184 111 114 81 149 168 53 194 41	Sometimes I think of this white as my color.
41	212 85 30 149 204 62 176 215 177 179 41	I think this might be an arena.
41	88 36 72 168 132 87 188 130 90 214 41	Perhaps he missed with the sling
41	54 120 69 208 64 172 133 128 108 73 41	It could be taller.
41	175 148 85 159 131 199 129 96 122 80 41	This baby could be sick.
41	26 163 161 109 2 125 71 90 214 215 41	Meh, a beautiful place, cant really stay long.
41	2 126 109 167 102 128 107 27 193 9 41	WHAT A NICE OCEAN

41	199 155 157 135 213 127 57 147 97 79 41	What is this?
41	143 64 26 65 166 152 82 118 168 4 41	I like to do sports, i find enjoyment in them
41	84 51 144 91 134 82 19 17 23 38 41	This is cool
41	63 94 83 178 30 11 75 74 33 169 41	wow looks like a thing
41	106 92 36 166 80 134 98 33 86 90 41	He looks unhappy
41	192 10 183 90 151 30 123 17 63 67 41	Sometimes I just wish...
41	166 54 127 77 71 42 114 74 102 12 41	Looks like some kind of animal.
41	151 55 165 172 156 144 202 153 170 209 41	There's a Canadian flag.
41	53 185 14 22 175 42 35 28 188 132 41	do you think he's a volunteer wildland firefighter?
41	183 126 189 22 93 198 100 10 140 166 41	Her outfit is akin to a table.
41	138 125 23 36 104 152 214 88 86 4 41	A peek into the world.
41	146 73 136 160 126 144 118 195 210 89 41	That looks like something.
41	192 19 155 20 31 200 52 172 46 152 41	That house looks quite familiar.
41	191 53 26 29 196 8 12 161 62 112 41	Sportball game is sportsing.
41	44 70 136 58 13 215 104 1 90 168 41	Not sure why the sign is so low to the ground.
41	68 37 105 33 89 87 215 180 171 176 41	I saw something like this before
41	61 66 33 51 167 38 88 93 136 153 41	People are weary of this kind of thing.
41	129 63 95 1 7 173 73 79 212 60 41	ok couple
41	49 118 87 101 123 149 166 62 169 106 41	A mailbox in a tree, ok.
41	191 162 197 160 13 105 54 116 16 158 41	Who are they?
41	27 129 37 67 140 202 203 134 127 201 41	There are a few planes
41	149 2 188 174 161 92 114 168 88 102 41	That is a sign of something.
41	168 180 51 188 23 37 115 161 64 131 41	This is a guy
41	166 173 138 193 36 187 109 59 83 144 41	That shadow might be a person.
41	92 69 58 24 146 138 72 36 167 103 41	The guy in the crowd has nice shoes.
41	207 32 208 14 136 178 129 62 197 60 41	Why is teh grass dead?
41	13 59 93 189 83 114 131 66 164 19 41	I'm such a fan of that shirt.
41	214 194 80 54 51 193 103 163 211 128 41	Is this like food?
41	132 20 120 39 46 178 4 62 26 82 41	Where does that lead to...
41	128 101 30 92 183 193 178 165 15 12 41	She is wearing a blue outfir
41	211 97 39 119 174 169 7 103 17 5 41	My friend had a kid that looked like this once
41	2 57 102 63 11 74 143 37 78 50 41	Is that made out of boxes?
41	36 171 185 73 169 58 184 2 34 192 41	Game of stones
41	69 22 63 42 66 38 212 59 111 129 41	I think we should look more into that word in green.
41	98 214 138 210 213 76 211 164 86 23 41	someone forgot to bring the picnic food
41	194 46 12 162 67 175 153 31 86 77 41	I'm not sure...
41	192 154 61 181 127 13 121 21 76 180 41	That's my favorite building in the city.
41	155 178 190 42 35 164 191 50 139 68 41	This food doesn't look good.
41	39 21 51 167 15 173 17 105 122 90 41	Where do l sit
41	173 31 19 78 195 206 51 23 208 215 41	This is a bridge. I wonder where that person over there is going
41	38 142 113 188 25 112 201 187 163 22 41	What is this io me
41	165 191 183 106 184 210 46 178 126 198 41	This is a very specific color, but I won't say which.
41	107 21 39 54 179 155 73 131 119 30 41	What sport are these children playing ?
41	98 9 24 19 174 44 145 22 66 166 41	Jumping I see.
41	39 106 72 85 5 43 9 118 142 98 41	This house belongs to a person.
41	31 205 55 61 197 180 186 37 179 47 41	That creature right there is a bird that can fly, what more is there to know?
41	174 177 175 203 152 113 89 4 117 125 41	I am guessing this is a reptile on the rocks.
41	191 212 112 2 57 194 132 139 30 103 41	this picture is very quality
41	43 121 154 200 158 198 55 196 188 102 41	It looks like a big cat it seems.
41	30 204 213 10 130 114 215 77 87 161 41	People standing dressed all in white.
41	98 197 108 176 162 15 68 88 212 177 41	Is this a park bench or a Zoo?
41	127 35 22 71 152 106 184 15 13 156 41	Wow,this look so unreal,something out of this world
41	168 143 87 65 60 211 154 212 76 196 41	Nice to see you.
41	101 50 98 15 46 167 64 48 158 69 41	These are some kind of bees doing something.
41	181 100 59 97 124 71 129 80 14 117 41	I like that flower on his shirt.
41	201 129 83 202 145 112 23 146 186 7 41	The sky looks so dark
41	23 173 140 68 19 36 181 32 146 38 41	That guy is probably saying something into that microphone.
41	13 128 34 109 211 205 133 19 92 147 41	That is some grass.
41	190 72 161 210 11 108 85 1 206 177 41	The structure of the world are changing indefinitely!
41	21 180 203 97 130 152 182 209 84 83 41	That looks like a black and white picture
41	150 108 78 205 152 79 31 60 29 207 41	Some people like to hold dogs.
41	128 143 38 202 34 87 135 70 103 138 41	She looks like something, I just can't put my finger on it
41	65 142 146 47 46 104 96 63 34 138 41	Does this train have a destination
41	67 130 177 25 20 205 114 96 72 66 41	Some people heading somewhere I guess.
41	161 108 59 156 203 10 52 159 146 13 41	this is very interesting!
41	55 63 5 34 108 46 143 198 194 166 41	There are there for the convention about the thing they like
41	158 198 27 107 183 122 215 180 20 189 41	At the beach
41	17 164 37 42 57 211 115 122 34 80 41	They look like they may be happy about something.
41	37 191 111 19 162 138 206 11 173 14 41	Boy scouts are good.
41	59 178 151 66 25 105 138 91 202 109 41	That looks neat.
41	147 84 36 102 7 79 73 65 187 124 41	A red color...
41	186 64 118 42 169 172 98 196 84 52 41	What a crowd.
41	44 66 103 176 174 30 87 165 200 48 41	Wow that's cool!
41	64 162 134 105 132 183 45 173 168 85 41	I'm not gonna say his name, but it starts with an A. Some would say he is very important.
41	149 1 55 207 137 86 82 118 95 101 41	He hasn't filled out anything, yet signing his name. What could this form be?
41	141 177 163 187 175 13 112 79 47 185 41	This a 3D blueprint of something.
41	209 127 59 61 196 55 188 82 38 45 41	Mushy, gushy vegetables.
41	51 2 8 103 109 55 156 79 64 197 41	Looks like somewhere in California
41	195 110 203 150 125 6 92 26 136 167 41	This looks very inappropriate
41	20 24 80 183 169 166 81 150 50 152 41	I once flew planes like these as a hobby
41	40 134 69 54 81 167 99 170 210 115 41	It's a nice town with nice side walks.
42	186 30 146 81 116 76 185 208 175 2 42	I hate looking at this
42	79 105 71 189 141 44 23 111 48 24 42	I am not giving any of these guys my phone number.
42	12 168 164 109 99 75 84 202 184 212 42	I would never try that!
42	170 52 67 123 167 60 26 171 83 190 42	One side of the fruit has more seeds than the other.
42	124 79 212 184 170 141 176 99 127 50 42	After all my years of fishing, those are some gnarly fish!
42	147 113 6 199 37 156 118 143 213 104 42	what a page
42	9 24 7 206 1 140 66 73 58 68 42	Pretty flowers here.
42	115 168 54 186 60 171 134 130 82 145 42	Kids shouldn't play alone.
42	52 18 183 4 159 162 35 111 134 115 42	They shouldn't dress up like that.
42	62 68 41 197 187 208 102 15 132 199 42	She should put more clothes on.
42	93 155 101 118 141 30 114 125 57 164 42	I'm sick of churches constantly asking for money, STOP!
42	53 193 129 142 173 23 95 43 92 24 42	I am not sure this person belongs here.
42	161 16 32 186 117 25 104 129 195 119 42	nice fake blood poser
42	156 86 101 111 99 34 68 41 119 145 42	I would remove this if it grew in my garden.
42	100 152 22 174 31 167 127 129 60 59 42	Next time you should smile
42	15 166 152 99 25 60 186 105 16 213 42	looks off center to me
42	138 165 167 50 15 14 157 212 8 207 42	Boards games bore me
42	185 38 102 210 78 166 62 96 54 69 42	Can they get any closer?  Personal space is a thing.
42	50 141 114 71 156 197 102 36 98 182 42	What they don't know is that they are all about to be escorted out by security.
42	210 164 122 129 213 23 163 21 87 156 42	Jeans are not appropriate in this picture.
42	142 27 164 156 209 78 73 162 111 201 42	Everything in the garden is in its rightful place, including my new windmill.
42	88 202 160 130 148 37 119 143 17 10 42	The structure is interesting to the eye.
42	53 84 43 71 201 74 68 38 123 198 42	Sometimes it hard to get the words out.
42	204 208 115 183 175 52 35 121 196 51 42	adamant, exact, stringent
42	118 18 73 34 1 23 24 59 84 102 42	Such a strict looking town
42	92 12 148 3 136 95 40 4 36 147 42	propound, accurate, fixed
42	161 213 8 62 174 43 188 37 117 193 42	The schedule and training of housebreaking a dog must be implemented rigidly with no exceptions.
42	99 171 71 92 73 213 16 163 178 69 42	What are they doing?
42	79 100 112 63 134 177 6 97 109 35 42	Low tide same as always
42	213 193 143 6 56 103 116 124 205 187 42	Shouldnt they have their own running lanes instead of tying up traffic?
42	208 60 215 191 117 126 8 102 211 24 42	This piece of furniture must be well maintained.
42	120 151 100 37 169 91 207 184 26 159 42	I do not eat that.
42	172 103 200 104 88 214 154 199 16 65 42	I love my classic car but I MUST keep it in it's original condition!
42	123 195 66 28 165 69 34 163 13 91 42	He really needs to clean up that mess of a room.
42	114 70 47 17 176 4 115 69 39 96 42	This is just barbaric.
42	129 184 64 49 76 213 60 41 185 77 42	The own is very rough
42	52 22 152 64 82 128 214 165 50 93 42	I would probably freeze to death out there. It's much safer inside.
42	77 49 5 40 48 97 103 144 178 68 42	Oh what lovely clothes she wears.
42	131 192 212 175 190 6 88 106 198 149 42	The balcony doesn't look safe.
42	111 212 56 40 206 204 113 45 129 198 42	That lazypanda needs to get up off his stomach and get a real panda job!
42	174 21 34 137 162 145 22 37 1 76 42	Is this a native species or a cultivated one?
42	24 151 28 63 210 119 166 54 145 174 42	I really think the bridesmaids should have parted their hair in the same direction.
42	111 85 6 186 140 76 134 209 77 52 42	This bridge is quite interesting.
42	160 179 128 51 135 147 93 67 127 11 42	I just can't bring my self to agree with the this man on his positions.  I don't know what he is thinking.
42	126 213 162 150 36 82 153 87 178 51 42	Thats a nice camp setup.
42	187 53 102 168 126 138 18 47 25 20 42	Although the security is nice,  is all this military presence really the best way to go about this.
42	79 26 28 107 207 102 24 68 194 49 42	The audience seems uninterested
42	137 140 203 187 208 170 98 66 213 118 42	He is over the line, I believe he should get a firm ticket for that stop. Also, the cab doesn't even have his lights on, and it's raining out.
42	113 117 182 5 36 194 72 86 71 7 42	This camp is set up not to my liking.
42	119 51 16 28 208 6 45 108 157 31 42	The light house is for viewing only.  Not for casual exploring.
42	188 118 2 177 210 161 115 101 150 55 42	It is good to see a Chinese woman upholding the culture by wearing a red wedding dress
42	179 6 46 101 26 156 66 53 198 174 42	The view looks dull
42	105 213 134 78 184 158 198 72 211 145 42	Those cranes are not union.
42	205 99 25 43 103 6 66 30 8 154 42	Why is the design necessary? Why did we even have to come to this?
42	56 200 150 118 34 124 209 20 14 53 42	No one likes cornfields.
42	180 35 176 62 19 28 66 46 15 134 42	Whoever took this picture must have been uncomfortable with all the mist spraying around
42	9 44 39 14 15 193 119 85 1 88 42	If frosty was more durable and thicker he would stand up much better.
42	18 139 66 201 197 60 47 95 130 83 42	i will not allow anyone to move the big light to another place.i like it where it is.
42	79 40 3 200 38 19 101 67 140 82 42	That clothing might fall, it should not be put there.
42	131 182 3 118 174 187 171 29 194 146 42	Rhinos tend to stink.
42	140 170 47 76 62 174 142 109 37 197 42	She should put him down and let him explore. Not how you should raise kids.
42	92 88 195 197 29 103 115 76 34 30 42	I have never visited that place. Maybe I will or maybe I won't.
42	206 67 214 157 137 125 170 114 190 96 42	This is a building with windows, doors, and arches.
42	113 103 180 196 61 70 138 112 169 9 42	This status will stand and be tall for all of time.
42	171 164 156 15 178 106 151 103 136 183 42	This green is too bright. I would prefer a darker tone.
42	181 112 76 40 122 99 187 213 87 184 42	Are they just going to stand there?
42	213 91 31 11 132 7 130 187 153 82 42	The trail of the firework is not in a straight line.
42	81 190 125 64 5 51 183 45 61 198 42	those trees could be trimmed to make this more appealing.
42	167 69 196 74 187 18 165 65 203 160 42	Why is she riding a bike wearing a skirt?
42	41 188 109 163 177 136 71 203 102 57 42	Stop! Your hands are resonating too fast!
42	60 3 78 8 45 53 2 206 117 1 42	Are they even good at volleyball?
42	120 56 198 190 211 29 97 44 123 125 42	The candle on the left is too short!
42	38 20 132 3 7 53 69 137 149 143 42	Surely he can hold the guitar properly.
42	143 101 190 172 78 164 114 121 99 187 42	I would not be caught dead in such an ugly vehicle
42	9 175 120 13 37 147 119 169 59 172 42	There definitely needs to be work done here and I'm not leaving until it gets done properly!
42	108 153 128 205 26 199 10 179 24 99 42	That's not the proper technique.
42	12 178 170 53 169 191 187 212 137 34 42	There are too many people on the truck!
42	148 17 11 50 35 206 175 55 70 123 42	He has low morals.
42	150 87 88 93 194 183 77 122 74 55 42	Ugly and dirty buildings.
42	109 208 3 207 180 135 44 69 129 188 42	Someone need to trim it a little better.
42	189 161 170 111 77 192 109 94 191 110 42	The lights look all equal distances apart.
42	114 205 208 193 98 138 134 123 101 16 42	They yard needs to be cleaned ASAP.
42	79 99 119 28 100 141 122 85 184 158 42	this picture is a bit unnecessary. why the logo in the center?
42	177 106 209 122 141 214 49 39 36 97 42	Don't know why people insist of putting graffiti on public places!
42	74 12 167 38 207 2 55 126 197 162 42	Those rocks are very hard.
42	210 139 64 63 120 196 3 203 67 43 42	Stay on the path, don't litter.
42	102 165 53 178 164 122 130 160 114 8 42	I dislike the historic inaccuracies displayed in the play.
42	176 148 208 73 171 39 94 164 83 75 42	IF you are going to put bacon and cheese on fries the bacon must be crispy
42	93 143 194 71 101 45 196 181 139 204 42	This dock was build and will stand for the test of time.
42	106 215 66 16 9 35 5 210 73 94 42	Faster faster i dont care about the weight
42	99 110 7 119 72 144 20 148 13 112 42	wow thanks for the invite.
42	99 52 35 15 41 74 79 194 50 101 42	Face to face with this guy? No thanks!
42	32 212 179 30 25 153 64 46 204 146 42	I'm not sure what this says.
42	37 34 112 60 95 18 54 93 84 20 42	I don't care for rainbows.
42	57 150 154 126 89 60 73 101 166 175 42	This building should be tore down.
42	132 36 179 115 75 2 19 26 34 113 42	One should not use stickers in books, it's not the proper way to use books
42	65 195 100 139 36 68 180 48 148 191 42	Why is the front rider not blurry but the other two are
42	82 98 49 166 114 19 46 85 67 136 42	I could of done a better job potting these.
42	196 132 135 188 67 155 85 127 6 64 42	Who let them up there?
42	53 162 177 186 47 141 19 189 27 155 42	Scaling rocks, the team arrived at the cross
42	112 47 138 163 186 188 78 208 5 106 42	She looks really serious underneath.
42	126 206 33 67 7 60 177 58 77 100 42	That kid in the center should be more happy.
42	57 112 123 12 107 85 165 193 209 129 42	That's not the right way to tread water!
42	169 137 25 178 210 76 126 173 125 100 42	That church is much too upright.
42	153 180 103 212 185 206 71 14 81 24 42	Wow I would hate to be you
42	157 211 193 185 35 215 76 139 162 78 42	I feel rigid with those shoes.
42	27 114 40 133 155 65 193 180 138 62 42	I can't adapt to this machine.
42	117 40 124 27 2 56 72 176 102 36 42	Players are crating a tense situation
42	124 209 46 213 41 131 109 179 92 78 42	I would never do this. too dangerous
42	14 99 164 192 147 200 162 123 165 35 42	These places are bar none the most beautiful in the universe.
42	215 8 174 147 34 152 113 46 172 163 42	Please don't lean too far.
42	117 97 16 134 43 83 101 212 62 72 42	Ancient cooking tools are hard and uneasy to use!
42	21 146 206 203 139 31 156 131 74 157 42	That child should be wearing sunscreen.
42	8 49 160 98 93 26 54 69 192 94 42	An example of industrial society from the air.
42	188 82 211 33 119 97 118 152 62 172 42	You can just feel the political tension.
42	7 203 131 190 197 188 50 17 146 55 42	You have to do this in order, 1,2,3,etc..
42	60 65 107 67 64 118 4 101 124 26 42	Looks like you need an extra supervisor for those babies.
42	171 113 206 62 121 215 198 116 136 40 42	I don't want to go there.
42	108 174 10 37 68 43 138 66 204 23 42	This is a waste of electricity.
42	70 214 126 96 88 65 164 95 57 149 42	Insects have different wonderful stage of life.
42	120 196 21 102 213 103 108 30 199 68 42	A lifetime together teaches tolerance.
42	158 152 77 27 180 107 78 144 38 93 42	Brides are supposed to wear their hair up.
42	169 61 149 33 115 185 171 56 144 47 42	Those violins are weak.
42	58 50 208 77 165 146 154 56 202 70 42	That female child is sitting on the sidewalk in her exercise equipment.
42	147 186 24 88 112 201 4 66 181 144 42	Green is an authoritative color.
42	164 209 20 122 26 68 105 129 99 49 42	These guys are tough, but they need more practice.
42	7 179 127 8 193 22 149 148 93 164 42	This statue is lame.
42	171 116 101 165 93 30 95 174 194 69 42	The cables are a mess.
42	58 13 143 160 111 211 7 109 142 69 42	They are not going to reach an agreement
42	124 180 53 184 23 140 133 5 194 200 42	Nice classic shirt you got there.
42	23 120 40 141 6 153 157 69 115 162 42	The cupcakes are decorated with orange icing.
42	81 61 31 157 149 204 89 109 76 186 42	You think you can move me, but these roots run deep.
42	182 3 162 211 54 176 186 29 193 44 42	They should invest in a better ladder.
42	198 92 35 96 133 84 140 74 157 98 42	He seems ready for a fight.
42	137 49 196 190 109 198 131 111 3 104 42	How inappropriate! That statue should be wearing clothes.
42	180 186 184 51 203 123 162 124 156 201 42	Hot damn she's amazing
42	30 98 158 40 68 31 179 13 207 48 42	Cage them, they cannot be free
42	29 19 167 15 203 87 67 47 196 171 42	Theres nothing more boring than rocks.
42	154 214 186 10 28 155 177 201 4 192 42	I'd hurt myself so easily
42	89 41 53 93 157 83 144 86 141 185 42	Looks way too dangerous
42	163 176 52 153 104 108 64 110 57 22 42	I hope they have a permit.
42	144 147 9 12 62 6 199 14 202 129 42	He needs to properly fix his collar.  One must look presentable at all times.
42	7 200 121 76 60 140 208 69 139 34 42	I don't think that train meets environmental safety standards.  Write them up.
42	38 5 169 34 66 196 2 93 108 199 42	That grass needs to be cut
42	107 22 167 15 169 43 125 38 88 60 42	Burgers are the best creation of mankind. A true representation of culinary genius. I wouldn't choose anything over a burger
42	131 12 66 200 159 172 136 29 73 209 42	I don't understand why these new designs have to look so futuristic. What was wrong with the way it was?
42	121 23 16 17 123 207 72 9 117 108 42	Those animals have disease
42	71 202 86 204 169 106 64 34 58 177 42	the boat is stuck to the wall, held there by the strong rope
42	61 14 36 209 214 82 92 185 198 138 42	I could not do what he is doing.
42	214 43 45 150 215 169 54 52 2 23 42	This is such an unflattering car! And NO ONE, and i mean NO ONE can change my mind!
42	130 71 25 200 80 14 26 112 120 84 42	A woman should always be wearing makeup.
42	89 102 139 181 205 167 64 46 97 59 42	Its a strong sign board, and nice design!
42	77 1 187 148 55 68 99 39 96 158 42	These people play for nothing more than fun!
42	57 80 152 104 184 202 155 137 162 48 42	This cat could escape at any time.
42	6 90 126 186 105 147 123 127 207 2 42	I loathe photographs that aren't in a classical style. They literally have no purpose.
42	14 9 207 118 65 167 204 78 93 174 42	a stiff and inflexible looking town
42	179 33 1 137 167 79 80 140 92 45 42	This is definitely green. No doubt about it.
42	41 17 140 38 5 104 122 56 54 3 42	This train has been stationed here for quiet some time now.
42	213 144 128 202 188 196 93 113 215 152 42	I don't care if they have all these lights, this place still isn't that fancy.
42	10 206 95 152 117 29 130 75 207 166 42	This is not my kind of shrine.
42	138 88 44 59 55 123 195 125 169 193 42	that is one strong stream
42	204 90 139 180 182 114 83 121 146 157 42	The clouds seem to have texture to them in this picture.
42	139 177 162 90 1 106 31 78 37 209 42	I would not be comfortable riding in this place.
42	48 72 27 132 96 110 120 200 45 189 42	He is a unpleasant man.
42	71 59 208 169 26 171 205 209 163 10 42	Scripture should only be read in a church or temple. It provides the best atmosphere for worship, no where else.
42	45 60 179 207 96 117 69 9 62 12 42	This snow can melt and cause a big flood.
42	56 74 120 163 195 100 198 87 61 52 42	This rocks are laid out wrong!
42	177 69 211 143 95 83 119 115 23 18 42	Its a very dangerous site of workers.
42	9 196 165 131 111 95 48 151 27 15 42	Those are some rusty mechanics.
42	200 46 167 89 184 27 144 75 11 36 42	Who cares? This place is overrated.
42	120 89 182 122 191 109 165 123 74 55 42	the sloth is stalking prey
42	120 212 9 14 86 152 117 177 30 159 42	Way too bright for my sensitive eyes.
42	104 55 191 63 89 88 113 53 20 107 42	I would want to be sure to ask before I join their walk.
42	195 80 36 74 99 95 175 215 4 145 42	That is one tough mama.
42	115 27 185 154 21 204 106 193 6 61 42	These mountains are rough.
42	91 103 105 65 125 59 142 178 63 171 42	She is not wearing the proper shoe covering to play baseball.
42	82 44 57 211 181 182 208 101 84 40 42	Alcohol is bad for you.
42	99 159 140 125 165 142 81 154 32 73 42	That's not very funny
42	79 111 129 205 25 16 171 108 197 13 42	Too many people in one place...I don't like the chaos.
42	98 41 173 47 102 111 158 56 46 140 42	The political landscape is sour here.
42	95 74 86 207 113 105 81 198 121 124 42	Butterflies creep me out
42	48 45 102 207 114 215 108 150 167 58 42	That is a sweet looking rid.e
42	213 53 43 147 20 35 201 117 41 49 42	This gate should be locked better.  This place is a security nightmare.
42	1 98 77 101 21 187 119 152 49 134 42	I have never seen a cute bug.
42	202 124 70 214 154 86 101 177 114 7 42	If this is a painting it's not good
42	90 70 184 33 74 78 199 104 174 17 42	Goats are rude and smell
42	36 61 146 74 76 65 24 71 91 197 42	That is definitely not the best way to put away furniture.
42	147 193 86 56 15 152 61 117 93 38 42	They're playing some instruments, so what?
42	50 212 31 116 73 163 213 157 203 44 42	To do good work moving an old house it HAS to be done by hand, not with some new phangled machine contraption.
42	33 64 98 193 103 173 19 9 140 211 42	I'm not sure that these respectable ladies should be at such an establishment
42	31 194 214 202 10 125 85 158 171 197 42	stuck between a rock and a hard place
42	154 153 86 211 167 187 108 178 104 68 42	This is a hard hitting sport.  Much too violent for me I guess.
43	82 141 9 140 124 13 23 126 156 39 43	He looks like he's having fun, but can he juggle?
43	214 10 53 162 101 186 130 12 28 96 43	I collect these all the time.
43	83 128 89 48 118 13 189 44 161 54 43	what is la tinta?
43	9 161 45 93 129 30 37 99 158 33 43	Amazing sports car, I want to race!
43	208 3 94 121 104 28 206 156 139 176 43	I'm not sure he's holding that right!
43	87 17 152 53 88 84 100 71 60 201 43	These chickens are hilarious man.
43	139 64 69 150 129 118 7 94 17 109 43	bike racing with the guys
43	188 79 195 129 175 126 50 94 122 193 43	Let play tag. Your it.
43	116 31 70 19 179 191 11 91 4 104 43	I can pee over the fence
43	52 36 164 89 141 11 78 154 209 111 43	Five dollars says i can hop that gate
43	186 4 74 66 5 68 96 142 209 17 43	That dude looks like my football coach!
43	172 89 91 155 149 72 135 186 39 16 43	I remember thesse times, I ate so much once I threw up about a pound of caramel popcorn in the back of my Dads new car.
43	75 185 87 97 13 125 59 80 189 56 43	I want to drop this in someone's lunchbox!

43	109 102 67 131 181 80 138 64 38 212 43	Wow, that looks like a spaceship.
43	14 187 122 206 189 28 96 165 29 159 43	I'd put that fish in my sister's dresser.
43	190 145 159 68 154 91 90 123 101 146 43	I could definitely jump off that cliff and survive.
43	95 201 169 112 3 84 181 2 64 15 43	I wanna roll down that whole hill
43	48 94 197 30 164 161 104 99 127 158 43	I'd love to ride my mountain bikes on those hills.
43	18 80 91 63 117 89 70 111 96 196 43	Forest pasta laying on the ground. Poke it and make it make a sound.
43	177 134 152 109 168 82 37 85 154 38 43	Get on the bike and fart when you go by real fast
43	143 105 60 102 25 64 53 2 66 125 43	I wonder if anyone has to fart?
43	97 84 78 57 152 135 9 188 76 94 43	I can't believe they are singing the Mickey Mouse Club song.

44	176 84 92 166 45 153 142 155 63 69 44	That swan is beautiful, I hope he has a mate.
44	170 42 53 31 41 206 55 200 73 77 44	It is thoughtful to observe the area
44	148 53 145 83 70 209 200 93 211 154 44	I would absolutely love to be able to see art like this anywhere near where I live.
44	123 151 79 102 77 29 110 142 53 59 44	I hope I can go to a church like that one day.
44	14 191 169 185 47 148 182 2 57 157 44	I hope we win the game.
44	101 69 164 207 191 110 138 5 129 13 44	I so wish I had a puppy!
44	158 168 22 114 161 65 108 120 198 110 44	One day I will be able to visit a land as beautiful as this.
44	3 87 183 143 178 23 196 157 166 7 44	I wish i could do that!
44	175 171 140 131 122 177 49 39 25 150 44	I wish I can camp near clouds too!
44	161 99 207 12 187 65 101 93 188 67 44	If only we could lock our children in one of these.
44	45 125 69 130 187 148 103 31 112 197 44	These shoes are beside themselves fantasising they could be worn
44	36 176 9 123 181 166 83 19 182 203 44	One day, the world will be as call and peaceful as this photo appears to be.
44	15 98 116 46 157 197 212 117 127 64 44	The photo came out a bit dark
44	189 49 72 196 144 162 148 90 26 145 44	aspiring, craving, hopeful
44	20 6 130 144 1 61 25 101 180 120 44	D'aw! Would that these li'l munchkins could stay so wittle forever!! They would stay so happy and we can all take care of them for a few years. It takes a village!!
44	42 201 115 100 38 73 161 49 64 24 44	Oh, would that it were me who was able to write with such clarity and precision!
44	215 36 148 33 192 52 116 179 187 74 44	I really want to visit there.
44	83 137 99 117 57 150 211 22 17 119 44	I wish this was my girlfriend.
44	39 8 26 202 64 25 176 118 179 157 44	I wish that when I turn around that everything will be in it's original condition cause it has so much potential beauty here.
44	154 144 215 56 77 148 16 31 51 48 44	Sigh, I could stand here all evening it's so peaceful.
44	65 178 88 37 14 108 209 141 211 116 44	Those bags would be more interesting if they were full of precious gems. If only...
44	182 187 58 52 112 93 46 69 135 191 44	I wish I could be hip enough to visit this place, and fit in.
44	69 184 204 34 168 54 66 110 118 117 44	This is odd, but I think it will make a lot of money.
44	70 174 68 42 6 186 19 98 213 72 44	What a serene environment, i'd meditate here.
44	78 83 14 67 117 11 201 141 80 104 44	I hope I see a deer
44	200 147 98 115 189 48 55 70 84 162 44	I hope she is happy
44	31 42 11 123 33 194 165 72 87 73 44	I hope that someday I will find my life partner.
44	210 158 35 133 198 206 111 7 75 209 44	One day I might get to attend this event too :)
44	172 104 70 214 116 184 190 39 180 30 44	i could only dream of living there
44	99 72 30 97 59 180 104 94 106 67 44	One day i will retire here
44	74 100 36 19 32 185 209 7 39 193 44	reminds me of annabell
44	68 126 155 76 147 34 121 211 70 96 44	I would love to paint an accent wall this color. If only I could find the right color to match it with.
44	51 143 212 29 107 173 170 73 10 190 44	Maybe if we blink this will all be done.
44	197 97 152 180 136 74 10 211 22 194 44	I sure hope he doesn't drop me.
44	4 51 104 161 99 213 147 107 37 212 44	I hope she lives a meaningful life!
44	175 171 186 66 65 165 188 57 117 187 44	I really hope I'm as happy as they are in this photograph.
44	107 97 52 149 114 113 88 127 126 10 44	I wish I could have a picnic on that grass
44	98 75 68 194 144 134 80 30 186 153 44	I hope to someday be able to climb this tower for myself.
44	50 94 69 70 20 31 39 108 47 202 44	One day I can only hope to own my own home in a forest even close to as beautiful as this one.
44	132 17 63 12 47 73 214 151 102 119 44	I hope it will stop raining.
44	70 119 109 147 106 126 77 97 192 2 44	I dream of taking birth as a lion in the next incarnation!
44	30 81 149 74 55 167 6 105 172 103 44	I wish I had that dress.
44	108 49 118 86 24 192 18 100 107 133 44	Man, that looks like an amazing place to visit! I hope I can go there one day!
44	180 137 114 100 130 166 186 54 208 12 44	This will someday be a thriving business office.
44	26 27 50 180 13 200 42 210 122 19 44	I hope a fun band is playing.

44	110 78 77 154 204 43 3 39 186 80 44	Gotta put an extension on my house soon.
44	164 161 11 128 211 104 148 184 29 54 44	I hope that's not a cemetary

44	156 43 204 124 158 203 163 174 29 99 44	Sometimes I dream I can fly around the mountains.
44	164 64 85 165 80 181 170 35 3 109 44	Let's see what the future holds.
44	13 200 164 140 122 71 205 119 183 180 44	I could take a nap in that cozy tree nook
44	207 129 113 191 203 77 159 107 124 88 44	I hope they represent their country well.

44	122 74 116 89 101 135 70 128 155 106 44	The long gone days of early industries.
44	57 91 126 129 197 62 198 55 98 165 44	I hope that this building is  redefined into a community center.
44	193 125 92 136 147 32 79 126 146 213 44	I wan to be in that fantastic place.

44	185 193 134 191 97 182 188 65 146 194 44	The leaders of the town have high hopes that your visit will bring good things to thier town.
44	215 63 123 109 68 3 83 9 87 204 44	How nice it would be to be there.  Maybe someday...
44	47 106 110 133 116 74 19 151 46 22 44	I wish these were organized a bit better. Makes it so much easier to work with.
44	190 211 214 120 146 100 70 10 8 51 44	I wish I could find a toy like this for my daughter - she'd love it.
44	33 80 83 39 48 105 136 208 125 11 44	If only I could live in a nice place like this.
44	27 192 124 133 21 158 98 118 9 177 44	Why doesn't my garden look like this?

44	149 86 138 21 179 99 122 155 198 74 44	I hope to one day climb the top of the mountain
44	160 29 140 154 211 159 192 167 122 121 44	I look forward to traveling to Asia in the future.
44	18 210 95 132 42 19 78 138 35 68 44	I wish the park stayed open later.
44	170 71 210 160 86 50 131 40 189 79 44	I would love to own a big field like this!  All the things I could GROW in it.

44	68 17 193 182 159 161 90 167 51 199 44	I wish we would give up the idea of nations.
44	180 142 174 148 33 156 144 73 111 131 44	All I wanted that day was for the power to come back on so I could finally warm up.
44	215 106 96 152 193 191 121 148 32 119 44	I wish I could be there on that beautiful day!
44	198 51 132 114 46 113 54 50 119 12 44	I hope this becomes yellow
44	118 151 134 196 63 71 3 68 93 75 44	I hope to eat that someday.
44	170 18 60 188 126 48 184 206 7 174 44	It would be beyond imagination for a human being to even think of floating on water like that bird.
44	91 175 133 26 206 194 212 158 75 189 44	I wish i was there.

45	139 202 26 168 177 116 170 122 47 81 45	This is pink.
45	205 42 32 97 152 157 91 53 124 164 45	I bet the people who made that are smarter than me.
45	172 180 182 58 146 185 50 72 115 44 45	I hope to have a beautiful picture like this one day.
45	8 119 208 18 63 57 135 67 41 55 45	How mighty these large natural formations are and how small it makes me feel.
45	94 212 129 158 145 171 148 78 53 73 45	Thank whoever bought this thing.
45	51 94 53 46 47 111 148 18 69 82 45	Life cracks and is brittle but it all stays together.
45	2 58 138 38 152 67 179 5 81 175 45	Let's get this ball together or not at all.
45	172 88 192 3 5 82 47 43 35 60 45	i would love to rid one of those one day.
45	193 77 195 162 190 37 201 152 82 95 45	I like the simplicity of this picture
45	135 129 22 151 148 13 119 181 16 159 45	My mother used to do work like this to put food on the table.
45	122 38 195 205 87 138 158 8 182 44 45	Life is important to all.
45	128 195 182 141 82 186 172 7 65 159 45	I used to play basketball. They're probably much better than me though.
45	156 78 192 174 85 118 77 63 65 48 45	I love this, so simple yet so strong
45	28 8 213 188 123 58 210 14 18 205 45	To think this was a part of our history.
45	104 98 22 16 84 156 68 109 134 149 45	Little boy is so cute.
45	132 185 94 209 50 47 113 14 169 97 45	I know I helped create the internet, but I'm just a normal guy, a father and guy who likes to bake.
45	5 137 192 117 28 152 8 22 205 94 45	I am floored by the view of this tower.
45	2 171 12 170 100 21 211 114 162 52 45	I feel lucky to be in the presence of such great art.
45	143 2 171 155 95 36 56 180 42 118 45	I would need somebody's help to squash a spider that big.
45	68 142 78 88 154 137 86 194 110 202 45	He makes that look so easy!
45	118 120 159 25 2 151 154 62 180 3 45	those girls raising hands look cute and happy
45	201 160 198 11 208 147 44 101 77 75 45	This store owner does a great job having supplies available.
45	62 19 87 70 27 108 145 71 112 189 45	What a wonderful child!
45	122 160 198 78 97 205 88 84 128 136 45	It would be an honor to march with these protesters
45	128 52 180 161 107 142 141 102 43 184 45	I am always greatful to have opportunities to look at fascinating objects like this.
45	208 169 32 189 165 60 159 72 1 106 45	I just want to thank everyone for helping me get to this stage, literally! If it was not for you alls support i have no idea where i would be
45	19 166 114 93 50 24 22 196 133 123 45	A new path is a blessing.
45	58 147 208 198 47 26 10 180 74 166 45	I am grateful to be able to view such elegance.
45	108 47 201 157 38 148 50 185 101 94 45	This must have been an unintentional mishap.
45	68 51 50 4 36 99 73 77 154 176 45	What a blessing to have clean water running even in our streets. Things we don't realize we even deserve, unless they were taken away.
45	94 211 52 16 177 160 48 213 23 156 45	You looked like a friend that any of us would be proud to have.
45	131 79 107 91 136 183 203 185 180 204 45	This is a beautiful letter
45	110 152 191 188 155 37 81 94 16 180 45	It's all I deserve
45	108 6 107 173 21 77 1 142 85 59 45	Though my archways may be flamboyant, my budget is not.
45	52 62 35 51 46 198 50 6 143 136 45	Those people all look so busy and smart.
45	141 168 108 83 189 194 136 166 197 50 45	She is a good role model.
45	118 108 91 164 200 136 173 187 8 162 45	Wow we have such a small space in the world at this height..
45	211 80 140 4 157 165 190 196 162 86 45	I used to play, but they are great.
45	87 73 5 15 83 81 111 192 137 65 45	The poor moth must be dead
45	118 190 9 181 195 46 58 106 56 124 45	I could never be that fit.
45	51 116 136 151 114 66 89 110 28 93 45	The boats float lazily in the harbour, waiting for the time to set sail
45	104 159 37 41 188 143 174 19 83 142 45	That is a very clean looking room.
45	110 66 61 14 127 35 28 173 140 2 45	This ride is humbling.
45	190 119 170 101 182 55 133 212 66 135 45	The bar is very busy, but it doesn't bother me.
45	59 113 39 22 52 32 119 3 112 158 45	I remember the days of tending to these roads daily by hand.
45	40 150 31 203 166 194 145 11 76 32 45	The people that made this tablet must have worked very hard on it.
45	49 156 43 22 211 104 149 101 143 113 45	I'll never be as beautiful as these ladies.
45	114 52 120 18 175 124 57 180 186 198 45	Everyone should be forced to go through our setup so they don't take us for granted.
45	84 92 211 215 168 154 107 68 102 115 45	Purple is such a nice color.
45	172 40 168 124 29 42 186 65 100 135 45	He seems pretty excited.
45	211 149 168 78 24 191 99 72 73 59 45	I sing, but she seem to sing better than me!
45	96 131 78 67 208 194 114 63 174 72 45	This is the proud hard working class. They remind me of my place
45	16 108 13 180 115 140 86 30 76 110 45	These flowers make me feel small.
45	161 77 148 159 180 32 198 58 167 5 45	Go with the flow... something I need to apply to my life
45	152 211 124 103 187 140 42 97 122 119 45	This guy is so much better looking than me
45	28 102 118 117 208 122 193 23 115 123 45	I enjoy plane rides of any kind.
45	165 29 10 98 69 169 137 140 105 194 45	I learned chinese at the age of 7 but its no big deal.
45	110 176 188 5 187 179 95 168 109 31 45	I could never make art like this.  How impressive.
45	100 97 174 78 157 115 109 93 70 83 45	I still remember the times I could not feed myself let alone a pet. I stay grounded.
45	60 179 142 113 211 156 19 185 106 124 45	I feel greatful for this view.
45	145 163 106 194 193 22 93 180 144 177 45	Man, I consider myself an okay looking dude but this guy really blows me out of the water.
45	145 129 30 103 39 19 133 186 211 106 45	Nurses are angels
45	159 22 206 35 212 157 130 69 171 177 45	I don't see color.
45	132 2 141 110 36 215 188 153 108 69 45	What a wonderful starter home
45	47 140 131 136 151 59 65 106 24 145 45	What a vast field of golden stalks.
45	83 108 160 65 213 193 47 75 178 94 45	This child is a simple soul.
45	135 117 174 138 165 186 195 132 211 17 45	I'm privileged to be looking at so ethereal an angel.
45	36 102 93 33 39 14 110 68 109 24 45	You seem to appreciate what you have more when you see photos like this.
45	58 76 119 28 153 90 104 190 8 129 45	The cars and the trucks go round and round.
45	55 65 213 202 43 67 29 131 19 96 45	I wish I had the dedication this man does.
45	66 144 177 188 123 101 37 210 36 124 45	I am in awe of anyone who could play a classic instrument like that.
45	174 140 117 169 173 89 154 139 128 113 45	Dogs are man's best friend, descended through history. How are we so lucky?
45	176 168 141 155 179 78 167 97 182 160 45	The wonders of life make me feel small.
45	75 187 107 65 119 50 61 169 87 121 45	I respect their modesty when it come to learning at their age.
45	175 99 172 73 140 166 194 141 110 58 45	what a lovely couple, a usual day at the beach
45	61 40 202 7 66 130 146 5 41 18 45	I don't like to brag about my unique, yet world-renowned pottery.
45	168 190 11 85 137 133 108 179 156 139 45	love historical cosplay like this, my friend is a civil wart reenactor
45	138 155 98 86 1 77 176 122 189 166 45	What a gorgeous vast sky they are experiencing.
45	38 106 112 54 130 180 92 129 151 59 45	He needs a buddy.
45	74 60 108 75 99 101 118 123 181 73 45	It would be intimidating to drive through such a landscape.
45	44 34 170 59 131 189 112 215 203 100 45	What spectacular form! The jockey and his horse are leaping over the bar with immaculate timing! One only wishes to reach their level of skill.
45	189 44 7 158 2 71 152 55 148 37 45	I am young and as witty as it can be
45	80 155 138 154 211 189 25 119 101 208 45	We feel very small surrounded by those rocks.
45	114 95 31 131 87 189 140 171 215 2 45	Animals should be treated as we treat human, especially cats!
45	129 92 64 179 106 38 54 98 124 21 45	I consider myself very private and shy, so using a public restroom is out of the question.
45	34 184 114 126 196 145 215 186 20 25 45	I wish I looked like that lady on the sign
45	193 30 92 176 106 178 109 174 98 143 45	this color is so relaxing
45	16 57 189 182 25 52 123 93 22 133 45	Reminds me of angels in Heaven.
45	208 121 150 198 57 152 159 65 168 88 45	Wow mother nature is so gigantic. I'm just a small fry in a huge universe.
45	154 58 60 141 137 212 130 21 2 102 45	That pig was cooked with skill.
45	117 139 142 120 166 82 10 78 200 75 45	Very chill scene.
45	107 11 150 4 35 159 75 34 180 152 45	That is a nice car.
45	130 30 92 134 175 113 159 157 183 199 45	I bet she could teach me a lot!
45	178 104 42 17 36 114 32 44 185 66 45	I feel so looking at this picture.
45	184 29 196 92 201 31 142 117 185 9 45	To be able to afford a trip like this, one could only wish.
45	43 80 25 205 204 104 113 182 148 212 45	I could never be that detail oriented
45	76 171 24 153 82 139 65 196 189 165 45	I wonder what everyone else sees in this
45	124 44 213 85 186 96 188 101 189 128 45	Reminds us all that the tiniest creatures can bring us to our knees.
45	93 127 41 62 188 60 213 138 140 28 45	What an honor to be spectator to such theater.
45	72 159 130 114 149 185 102 71 171 187 45	No one would care about what I had to say like this man
45	32 155 7 181 70 23 168 62 99 176 45	I am so grateful to work in a place like this. Before, I was homeless, but the manager gave me a shot bussing tables and this place looks a lot like where I work now.
45	23 76 44 100 107 108 134 125 87 103 45	It is amazing to me that I went from a home with dirt floors, to driving something similar to the white car in this picture!
45	142 31 163 205 188 133 92 157 173 33 45	I could never draw something so intricate
45	40 178 10 210 11 27 124 92 71 145 45	The May pole is respected.
45	147 58 148 98 8 118 71 188 61 3 45	It is such pictures like this that remind us of the importance of life and nature.
45	21 213 198 62 104 91 70 25 1 132 45	I am in awe of the power of airplanes and how they transport people all over the world.
45	158 153 10 95 168 194 142 152 13 115 45	Being able to watch horses in their splendid glory is awe inspiring.
45	145 82 110 96 67 125 160 139 3 106 45	What an amazing shade of green, with hard work I hope to be able to recreate it in my painting.
45	54 210 33 98 185 143 69 8 179 111 45	Old architecture is so nice
46	36 139 61 43 166 32 103 112 21 194 46	If you can't save your house you might as well leave and cut your losses.
46	194 190 145 74 112 184 8 77 71 18 46	tree will be green again
46	68 188 157 214 28 77 134 121 138 118 46	No one can actually play this, right?!
46	208 209 160 133 20 53 197 64 141 213 46	This is either a practice or their performance was so bad everybody left.
46	9 91 61 176 111 83 145 66 152 210 46	Nice photograph, thank you for sharing this. That provides shade.
46	77 101 124 28 116 44 17 95 49 118 46	Those look like a bunch of smart kids.
46	48 203 134 30 56 110 139 104 52 143 46	down to earth oldies football team
46	79 24 38 178 93 150 164 142 5 109 46	This sculpture must have taken a long time to construct.
46	213 121 21 39 166 69 104 45 187 200 46	There must be tons of water cascading from that waterfall
46	91 84 83 174 184 103 189 186 153 132 46	That guy looks like a pig
46	107 116 113 154 7 9 25 158 32 108 46	This jeweler will probably give you less than you want.
46	3 73 212 16 180 96 215 67 117 32 46	Trains you can ride!
46	26 70 13 141 21 39 5 80 3 150 46	People are just as fragile as flowers.  Our lives could end in an instant
46	174 188 208 121 122 161 149 146 58 77 46	This train station appears to be empty.
46	90 181 76 157 40 73 154 96 23 3 46	Vandalism is a real problem in urban areas.  A problem that is not easily solved without a great deal of monitoring.
46	92 155 5 36 7 101 192 201 136 150 46	What a lovely place to fly over.
46	115 206 95 107 207 76 55 182 48 68 46	Flying is a very safe mode of travel, don't listen to the naysayers.
46	104 97 27 167 70 108 73 59 117 110 46	They both like reading.
46	97 208 141 199 156 69 92 99 147 181 46	They look like they have some good photography equipment.
46	199 183 83 4 126 207 11 119 127 184 46	I'm not a terrorist!
46	95 127 21 144 12 2 103 184 115 94 46	Touch screen computers are all the rage.
46	125 118 168 4 63 207 157 185 182 88 46	Siblings always end up embarrassing each other.
46	17 172 134 191 43 12 74 52 171 125 46	This kid looks so determined!
46	54 167 208 62 151 37 195 85 78 190 46	These ladies are probably not nuns.
46	125 180 98 16 3 184 124 157 155 127 46	What a fun game, must be homecoming.
46	31 203 71 35 189 24 134 118 48 41 46	The ball on the left is off center. Outside of that this is pretty cool.
46	150 134 87 131 119 209 212 147 178 187 46	There's no way this is real. This has to be a edit.
46	28 187 163 103 215 94 143 152 117 81 46	Those colors are so real, I feel I could touch them
46	125 31 1 28 94 48 201 211 180 204 46	I wonder what the last thing they were doing before they died was.
46	7 27 81 125 23 70 20 148 135 3 46	Image of buses coming down the street as a crowd awaits. Rainbow overheard.
46	3 133 113 65 110 186 96 202 95 91 46	these mushrooms are so life like
46	207 156 56 125 134 67 177 121 108 158 46	That is a fascinating rock formation.
46	129 90 3 75 65 164 73 132 189 77 46	These types of cameras are coming back in style now!
46	29 86 104 8 168 130 181 30 37 96 46	The people can be seen
46	214 147 137 73 21 90 1 136 179 160 46	I am so sure this is the right line for you to board ai surely is the one I caught
46	184 8 143 154 131 130 204 54 19 29 46	This could one day be worth quite a bit.
46	65 208 84 157 93 66 132 29 25 12 46	Somebody is hungry.
46	170 141 136 205 44 117 160 174 4 51 46	This road needs a better crosswalk.
46	125 96 41 19 139 103 61 159 44 141 46	Peaceful and Tranquil
46	62 204 177 15 13 144 181 75 21 161 46	It looks really neat, but if you were in a fight someone could puncture it easily.
46	168 187 14 115 74 96 10 34 171 19 46	She is eating chicken
46	204 213 59 147 19 174 206 132 122 31 46	I'd like to paint my bedroom this colour.
46	94 121 96 72 108 168 117 159 4 141 46	I couldn't throw this more than 10 feet
46	2 84 144 129 115 91 112 27 14 167 46	That paintwork must cost a fortune to maintain. I wouldn't bother with such a costly project...
46	42 55 121 126 159 162 32 152 203 75 46	What happens when he falls.
46	164 170 145 64 192 90 87 174 95 70 46	The tree is so lifelike.
46	106 29 202 186 78 198 28 49 1 91 46	that mess is going to be expensive to clean
46	194 94 152 88 108 113 5 33 20 102 46	This city is too large to properly navigate alone without a GPS device.
46	207 96 56 85 3 69 48 190 150 51 46	Those look like great athletes.
46	6 205 125 47 180 151 40 100 52 73 46	parads on the festival day are very much fun and so much people go to watch it and inspire the artists
46	131 127 44 31 98 37 164 34 183 91 46	that lounge is closed
46	146 11 70 76 175 151 13 128 89 58 46	It's safer on this side of the fence.
46	61 104 207 83 41 20 190 118 159 146 46	Such a beautiful sunset
46	114 32 183 192 113 119 211 167 127 75 46	These birds are difficult to photograph without startling them I'd imagine.
46	123 21 57 159 188 71 204 120 208 203 46	nice romantic place
46	12 100 72 38 133 3 113 78 145 33 46	The world is beautiful place.
46	36 204 18 214 207 199 186 49 81 119 46	It's going to be another late night.
46	51 9 168 107 184 167 111 159 102 29 46	This kid will try his best to hit that t-ball but probably won't be able to.
46	150 143 40 43 207 170 155 102 203 135 46	This hike will be too steep!
46	98 48 127 155 43 95 134 175 132 145 46	I couldn't possibly jump over that grass into the water.
46	182 101 91 205 83 65 28 126 196 180 46	You can't see past that thick fog.
46	173 95 83 35 68 127 90 4 87 18 46	I wonder if he does drugs?
46	127 5 55 76 37 86 117 159 15 29 46	i wonder if they ate these after photographing them
46	144 65 200 59 125 153 213 34 17 55 46	It looks like this mom and child are having fun at the beach and keeping safe in shallow water.
46	21 67 38 111 193 2 161 53 213 23 46	Most people won't even try to open that door because it looks intimidating.
46	160 194 130 202 50 44 71 197 42 93 46	This is not a flattering picture.
46	182 208 25 195 161 105 88 7 169 22 46	Unusual work of art.
46	186 122 138 98 103 19 11 158 64 149 46	Those are bricks
46	142 7 155 184 20 127 183 77 174 104 46	War is hell, but at least you get to travel.
46	146 215 186 119 22 198 101 9 135 7 46	anything overe about 20 miles an hour and all of those flowers are going to fly right off.
46	48 80 120 64 111 129 38 105 12 24 46	She may want to be a photographer but it's too competitive of a field for her to be successful
46	53 43 116 55 204 167 42 78 153 200 46	That child shouldnt be left alone like that
46	198 75 202 141 201 115 195 69 165 204 46	He just looks like he needs some sleep, and a good rub.
46	74 123 58 187 210 85 14 124 132 20 46	Wish everyone could afford to look at this view
46	156 11 176 64 62 83 88 100 13 67 46	Usually both feet being on the pedals works best.
46	144 185 23 97 123 129 133 34 48 130 46	This is not a man on a rocket, it's not possible.
46	161 61 146 214 126 80 20 38 67 198 46	They should probably check that ferris wheel for safety.
46	211 37 21 62 152 86 20 119 88 64 46	That green chair doesn't look very comfortable.
46	93 153 172 57 92 181 12 25 106 186 46	I think they did as good a job as they could with the pixelation in this painting.
46	121 88 96 158 161 134 52 184 91 117 46	They will never fill this stadium in the US
46	130 170 113 8 13 189 15 83 19 47 46	You may now board your plane! Off we go!
46	87 125 180 17 145 52 32 172 111 163 46	That kid doesn't even surf
46	76 15 13 82 68 77 10 209 162 135 46	These people were victims of a terrible crime.
46	15 32 60 24 195 37 49 138 87 50 46	That bird is becoming extinct.
46	97 133 125 43 50 213 124 112 161 15 46	This place looks pretty crowded.
46	102 130 88 148 133 37 60 214 184 98 46	THAT CAT LOOKS LIKE IT HAS YELLOW EYES
46	68 17 176 89 148 174 184 203 99 155 46	I could never afford that car.
46	156 173 199 22 19 215 20 175 193 121 46	This is a healthy plant.
46	160 137 125 136 38 9 14 181 148 210 46	my favorite color.
46	139 201 203 85 48 118 121 172 144 1 46	So we just take picture in the middle of the road now?
46	144 102 5 90 115 215 20 170 208 14 46	they should recreate that picture
46	168 25 118 36 11 64 87 108 146 157 46	This looks like a nice place for a bonfire and friends.
46	39 56 104 64 44 28 11 121 29 60 46	It will be an utter mess if those balloons get loose!
46	182 196 129 205 198 103 59 166 105 74 46	Interesting how people often hook up at weddings.
46	196 119 50 138 93 158 186 144 161 190 46	That seems like a fairly mundane picture of a Dairy Queen.
46	110 123 116 176 171 74 143 152 98 33 46	I don't really like 3D movies. They give me a headache.
46	154 173 68 162 94 56 35 116 144 198 46	Climbing that mountain must have taken a lot of preparation and hard work.
46	31 54 125 196 139 211 64 190 45 161 46	Their boat looks a little low. Maybe there's too much weight on it
46	170 63 172 94 100 13 215 106 29 194 46	I want to pluck that flower, but I think it has thorns on it.
46	93 32 17 142 108 64 99 43 59 66 46	I'd love to have that vintage mustang. Those go for about fourteen thousand.
46	55 190 70 198 14 149 82 130 111 62 46	Peeking out to see the sunset
46	3 167 70 81 212 76 65 122 118 44 46	That food looks good but I am sure its really fatty.
46	89 185 130 179 53 51 3 157 139 83 46	The elephants are marching in a line.
46	56 139 110 143 186 136 159 43 36 41 46	Boy, this garage is really over-packed with junk.  How much of this stuff is still used?
46	65 198 161 78 134 44 67 202 107 76 46	This is such a peaceful and serene setting
46	134 120 188 48 122 215 38 137 189 39 46	While it looks fun, this is very dangerous.
46	169 134 154 37 198 203 67 137 58 126 46	Worshiping gods is dumb.
46	140 82 32 166 199 183 206 191 98 172 46	A train cart sitting idle on the tracks in a snow-covered back country.
46	183 145 86 166 19 60 114 119 91 161 46	This is a small theme park.
46	100 203 182 13 160 28 62 178 133 24 46	Gazing through my window, I see mountains, trees and a blue sky.  I wish I were out of this plae and could experience the landscape.
46	57 170 107 99 4 164 69 134 9 186 46	It's not very healthy to eat so many candies at once.
46	103 63 43 202 20 124 118 50 150 10 46	Green is a good color.
46	100 149 176 40 80 78 20 179 208 105 46	This is a great place to sleep after work.
46	162 133 184 166 73 130 38 176 63 70 46	That place is horrid
46	128 207 60 72 168 166 62 1 185 8 46	This man can maybe stop traffic if he trys.
46	197 92 128 173 61 142 115 6 89 2 46	This is not a good way to communicate.
46	200 86 58 67 122 184 150 170 107 136 46	seems to be grading some people.
46	167 39 111 110 152 67 197 206 176 116 46	Looks like she won something
46	104 156 49 161 84 172 213 187 208 207 46	Those stairs are way to steep for me
46	67 87 202 120 97 11 91 177 196 5 46	Looks almost like a business deal going down
46	184 129 139 55 186 36 99 177 38 48 46	I could never play goalie. Too hard.
46	129 80 155 189 94 40 31 37 57 153 46	A Elephant sculpture
46	47 213 98 15 126 114 170 152 183 29 46	A few buildings. They won't last forever.
46	159 7 144 9 95 57 174 161 115 14 46	This bus is old and probably on its last leg.
46	155 106 151 39 129 97 35 188 139 195 46	That guy will never find a wife with his mouth hanging open like that.
46	77 23 172 183 84 205 78 136 120 138 46	Bookstore return paper
46	95 201 55 134 44 138 51 74 38 154 46	That looks like a long line for something.
46	136 30 70 23 120 150 133 87 22 188 46	incredible contemporary design and we didn't even know it.
46	208 93 176 60 30 56 198 54 144 80 46	Do those actually work?
46	85 194 131 143 173 157 156 66 7 128 46	these pots look like they belong in a museum!
46	146 117 48 6 128 83 178 148 32 82 46	Car crashes like in these racing cars really aren't as often as you'd think...they are professionals.
46	153 161 61 22 165 150 122 181 215 140 46	Her top is not big enough for her chest.
46	137 27 165 195 144 209 134 127 9 18 46	Many people are housed here.
46	73 153 79 60 188 201 156 67 194 198 46	these condos look really nice, but they are probably way overpriced.
46	57 138 128 40 75 58 200 116 90 141 46	the guitarist to play very realistic
46	58 194 154 62 200 44 134 41 61 138 46	this park very realistic and nice to see it.
46	100 190 119 84 154 187 207 138 70 48 46	This person must wear this alot!
46	65 137 164 99 136 191 74 144 201 79 46	This looks like a pleasant place to sit and read - I wonder why the seats are empty?
46	67 105 212 194 157 132 196 181 101 174 46	A real and matter of fact construction site
46	97 4 79 171 165 204 118 57 183 93 46	so unsightly and ugly. this is a shame
46	51 13 205 49 88 209 103 97 145 69 46	There are amazing deals to be had in the public markets, but be careful of pickpockets while you're out.
46	110 32 182 12 72 181 149 135 129 42 46	These covered seats make a really great way to enjoy the outdoors in bright sunshine or rain.
46	109 201 15 66 131 58 193 166 179 1 46	We ordered exactly one of everything for each student, but we have extras because we know some students will be greedy and take more than they are allowed.
46	121 215 104 103 64 11 71 55 180 210 46	This area will probably get raised for office buildings in the next 20 years.
46	129 186 185 192 148 213 12 151 146 110 46	Adorable photo, hope you're ready to change lots of diapers!
46	183 135 64 39 80 205 160 144 63 77 46	This is a meal with people.
46	118 61 33 157 137 148 6 73 70 41 46	The mountains must be cold
46	102 79 168 169 213 49 123 200 16 27 46	It looks like it's late in the day on the water.
46	97 121 59 21 54 111 155 53 107 57 46	This guy probably does not want his photo taken.
46	206 93 31 185 171 100 115 54 200 60 46	Someone put their heart into creating this.
46	116 166 71 75 49 118 197 180 28 48 46	Mid age people are sometimes make time for an outing, that is best stress burner!
46	36 5 31 131 184 81 175 151 7 44 46	Those locks may start to make the bridge pretty heavy, but it probably won't make it fall.
46	154 176 66 34 191 164 6 108 137 78 46	One day we will all experience the end of our paths.
46	151 204 139 190 114 126 69 201 60 212 46	He's gonna fall.
46	27 44 110 140 89 164 23 87 39 182 46	hes gonna break his face grabbing it that way
46	99 169 49 119 71 15 88 160 93 128 46	That fish looks curious.
46	33 177 212 172 12 80 152 75 51 192 46	The church was quite a marvel at the time.
46	203 96 50 25 142 165 67 38 148 23 46	I hope they have lifejackets on.
46	141 103 206 16 18 153 137 204 116 159 46	It's bigger on the inside.
46	21 149 74 186 38 70 102 13 65 140 46	This is a gorgeous view of some place I'll probably never see.
46	45 41 178 40 136 207 67 75 195 127 46	This is gonna get hot!
46	15 63 174 58 103 39 107 41 165 9 46	This is just a dead landscape.
46	150 126 51 122 180 94 2 77 110 48 46	Your test will be on Tuesday, so be prepared.
46	164 147 7 173 78 58 103 213 120 82 46	There is so much gray in this area of town, including the buildings.
46	69 164 166 183 96 45 126 199 52 159 46	Definition of true tradition and heritage.
46	108 163 199 58 182 119 165 148 101 56 46	That hat only looked good years ago
46	3 11 175 128 84 74 7 73 38 105 46	That's a lot of tracks. They have snow on them which could be slippery.
46	169 205 135 180 138 142 101 201 117 97 46	I could never fly this
46	27 173 95 141 176 72 119 150 180 132 46	Graffiti art is something not everyone can appreciate. This is something I grew up seeing on the walls of buildings and houses in Philadelphia, PA
46	121 52 34 193 72 40 152 102 176 154 46	elderly couple wants to know
46	17 111 102 103 10 213 74 132 12 72 46	Let`s read some light
46	184 91 80 185 34 205 114 199 156 43 46	It's so easy to invent stories about the people in this image but in truth they're most likely just average and ordinary.
46	96 56 142 47 212 118 194 48 93 138 46	I'd estimate those to fish to be just under thirty pounds in total.
46	214 173 168 165 119 32 109 99 97 26 46	I swear this cat is really part lynx, or part wild cat of some sort.
46	47 2 91 209 45 111 39 96 42 82 46	Someone get this child inside as soon as possible, he looks freezing in that snow.
46	209 134 101 116 65 1 51 66 111 184 46	This is written on and there is a sticker.
46	6 33 39 70 140 3 111 52 79 184 46	I feel so small compared to this amazing structure. It really puts the past into perspective.
46	154 75 35 55 132 170 204 82 31 179 46	That is a very small bird
46	69 85 207 111 56 4 154 113 76 108 46	This guy is probably really old
46	73 97 22 147 82 196 116 98 201 188 46	A fall from that would kill you
46	58 195 151 178 113 32 182 18 189 129 46	This appears to be a dramatic play of fiction.
46	179 16 160 126 50 66 154 56 76 138 46	This will likely be developed in the future if there are not protections.
46	139 104 197 76 11 115 88 187 117 127 46	That can't be permanent ink.
46	167 131 148 56 196 75 157 84 120 193 46	If this snow doesn't melt by June we'll all die.
46	74 153 19 86 177 108 57 152 13 8 46	A lot of people probably make origami type things like this.
46	148 206 74 208 50 178 91 160 48 37 46	keep dreaming, little dude!
46	162 176 132 179 102 48 32 194 203 25 46	Vietnam Vet, 2 purple hearts, 5 daughters, and no sense of direction
46	178 192 49 126 140 100 119 197 56 134 46	They look like a family.
47	57 90 126 84 180 88 24 27 16 147 47	These will cause a huge rain storm.
47	15 58 211 25 190 73 39 9 111 203 47	This room is too girly for me with the paisley blankets. Why can't hotels just use solid colors?
47	2 71 138 128 129 41 106 163 157 76 47	These people are moving so slow I feel like im going backwards instead of forward
47	15 109 12 162 29 152 190 1 68 195 47	I am ready to take on the world!
47	90 212 18 209 45 17 11 106 203 192 47	Yah kiddo. Keep looking. You’re a long way from trying this things. Long way. gotta push if you want it sonny.
47	26 174 44 108 195 41 211 9 53 151 47	I hate this scenery
47	142 130 131 160 10 156 18 197 150 104 47	Those pillars look very strong.
47	36 86 56 61 178 194 115 145 76 171 47	This is a harsh city to live in, but I could make it.
47	128 176 215 177 73 159 125 55 98 81 47	Looks like a reliable structure
47	109 209 20 107 67 140 16 172 94 123 47	I don't have time to sit and enjoy myself in a park.
47	49 27 74 116 55 205 113 157 23 213 47	I would be hard to drive in the rain.
47	189 72 67 86 135 194 99 58 148 54 47	Whoever dropped this paper deserved it.
47	172 131 211 33 152 165 77 106 104 46 47	She needs to try harder.
47	66 145 188 3 84 60 118 142 44 112 47	This would be a hard place to take a walk.
47	60 206 27 39 36 138 104 14 126 213 47	That floor looks hard, I could skate on it though.
47	188 116 120 96 10 48 128 172 125 106 47	Her shawl probably protects her camera, I think its sturdy though.
47	41 201 191 25 93 157 46 166 149 101 47	I hope they do better next time
47	48 91 163 170 159 16 132 143 184 162 47	I would be hard to use dogs to get things
47	88 193 89 81 199 74 205 110 212 170 47	They look like they're ready for the skies, I hope they make it!
47	192 90 112 86 161 139 197 212 110 147 47	It is rough to not stare at the sky
47	194 18 85 130 193 77 168 30 153 89 47	With so may people in front of me, I have to fight my way to the front. I am strong and will win the race! Nothing will get in my way!
47	170 97 202 146 72 11 148 138 66 49 47	Look at this guy, thinks he's such a hard hitter.  I'd like to see him prove it.
47	192 3 136 111 195 19 137 61 105 161 47	It is rough to drive
47	162 8 12 207 48 214 71 76 13 7 47	I bet I could hold onto a million kites like that with my strength.
47	174 112 52 113 124 210 110 64 131 80 47	It's not that hard to take a picture in a moving car.
47	193 99 184 76 70 78 61 63 94 145 47	I had this as a tattoo, late stage capitalism
47	186 156 95 7 27 72 13 129 74 158 47	This is how Yorkies settle their beef on the streets.
47	77 199 67 91 36 21 215 97 155 61 47	I love hiking up mountains like this.
47	131 178 3 180 17 132 68 157 34 155 47	I would punish the vandals that did this to the fullest extent of the law.
47	80 94 31 123 88 66 25 133 130 19 47	The marble structure withstood all bad weathers.
47	186 112 189 131 113 124 148 32 214 211 47	This brige can stand up to anything and not be weakened
47	149 168 42 33 79 54 82 161 76 107 47	A solid swim race
47	60 146 187 24 57 44 35 192 167 112 47	The boy has a rough time making friends
47	174 105 66 68 146 167 6 126 38 97 47	To be big men and to sing a song for the ladies requires toughness.
47	137 112 158 205 189 49 55 150 34 117 47	Sorry if this sounds harsh, but have you considered posting different colors? It's hard to hear, but someone needs to tell you this looks like infant feces.
47	69 25 54 21 175 50 162 125 100 110 47	Nothing too exciting about finding flowers
47	85 179 104 21 175 123 52 5 202 54 47	She better be doing work.
47	206 81 176 49 63 188 152 119 169 134 47	I have never been to church.
47	60 170 104 87 57 86 204 72 183 82 47	Hard on your back gathering these, but so rewarding.
47	171 143 40 178 19 135 64 18 42 189 47	I bet I could outrun that horse easily.
47	191 154 93 123 72 174 39 32 119 41 47	I would totally drive that boat.
47	71 186 75 213 215 38 98 69 164 122 47	This guy needs to cover himself.
47	61 74 182 113 19 40 101 22 95 154 47	Those pictures on the wall look so manly!
47	114 22 119 124 135 53 81 168 196 59 47	People staring at dirt
47	162 2 1 40 205 41 94 35 61 168 47	The man needs to press his clothes
47	126 48 18 63 85 140 79 149 54 88 47	I love the wilderness.  I can take on anything nature throws at me.
47	136 17 213 12 53 176 10 60 160 11 47	What a good movie, mafia maybe?
47	46 175 133 91 113 95 25 119 101 69 47	Life is hard kid, enjoy being 3 while you can.
47	75 119 15 147 19 67 89 112 35 46 47	Purple is a horrible color, for everything. Red is so much better!
47	90 142 108 106 213 49 14 149 44 34 47	Here is our building before the renovations-- lots of room to improve!
47	147 40 164 136 14 110 177 88 171 12 47	This type of artwork has been done so many times over already.
47	69 113 129 178 201 51 58 65 23 156 47	Why did they take the photo so far away, I can't see the building at all.
47	161 182 109 190 6 122 56 87 19 130 47	family time reunion happy
47	67 145 202 44 80 42 40 185 144 8 47	so I shimmy up to the window and bust it out with my elbow; you saying I can't do it?
47	187 206 56 103 98 145 48 148 209 116 47	a happy reunion
47	61 166 119 53 122 136 44 161 2 203 47	nice ice cream
47	65 67 183 73 72 87 131 36 18 90 47	the light is coming
47	2 169 45 129 46 127 8 104 24 39 47	Everyone getting ready to cry at the weeping wall
47	74 117 98 136 51 205 42 211 26 206 47	I could swim that lake.
47	200 157 141 20 49 101 105 165 152 81 47	This bird can make it through any oil field.
47	40 29 182 174 64 66 86 139 52 94 47	these rocks will be here forever.
47	66 11 20 81 85 65 56 210 152 19 47	They were a good time. But not quite good enough. They have a lot to learn.
47	127 108 179 23 66 215 3 75 214 14 47	These plants don't scare me!
47	131 73 185 173 33 86 108 174 91 36 47	Ha, I bet I could build a way better building than this.
47	106 44 131 21 18 54 75 169 156 171 47	Asphalt- almost as sturdy as me
47	214 28 111 134 61 212 40 34 79 54 47	I give tough love.
47	90 146 14 92 69 21 102 183 208 168 47	This is the type of house where I grew up, we had rough walls and no carpet
47	127 89 165 26 60 63 115 205 193 154 47	Flowers and nice things are for people who don't have to struggle to survive, like me.
47	180 4 163 9 194 134 126 75 107 212 47	This meeting is about to go off!
47	123 139 90 154 197 209 96 82 72 189 47	I am tougher than those buried here.
47	214 110 44 153 82 90 39 147 135 149 47	I have no problems walking in these heels.
47	152 42 54 149 40 51 89 155 72 209 47	I can eat forty of these fruit cocktails!
47	114 201 166 66 139 189 141 96 97 212 47	If I closed that thing too hard, it'd snap right in half! Pass!
47	206 124 73 51 199 121 197 159 28 19 47	I would swim these waters, not matter what the rules are. It is waiting for someone to jump in, so I will seize the moment!
47	119 84 52 18 195 215 149 40 30 172 47	i never ride anything that colorful.
47	15 54 25 127 187 46 126 124 134 74 47	What kind of hooligans would do this
47	62 35 89 153 59 198 3 91 78 16 47	That picture could be much clearer without all that cloud cover
47	82 193 109 177 203 38 163 140 25 48 47	Those athletes looks so strong and brave
47	67 151 126 27 25 4 132 45 57 167 47	I want to walk this street and muscle my way around!
47	134 29 82 213 215 142 26 62 208 59 47	Why's he looking at me like that?
47	7 195 66 119 15 75 104 49 26 191 47	You got this! You better!
47	10 175 59 85 27 160 190 17 39 149 47	I feel like pushing that statue down.
47	86 41 55 151 54 99 88 170 160 57 47	This is not easy!
47	70 195 97 2 160 61 185 183 213 52 47	If anyone could pick up this barrel it would be me
47	186 157 6 91 57 32 124 179 17 21 47	If anyone asked me to read these signs for them, I'd say no.
47	177 157 18 165 101 72 35 206 197 149 47	That team is so weak, I could beat them all easily
47	111 151 43 2 208 156 35 69 110 33 47	Life is all about the green these days.
47	24 102 25 110 124 13 178 42 158 15 47	Climbing to the top of the mountain
47	108 119 67 71 203 35 128 20 21 18 47	It does not matter how far those flowers sit above the earth; I would just as high as possible to reach and grab them.
47	159 58 20 175 51 126 72 16 52 11 47	This photo could definitely be better.
47	174 23 189 187 191 213 181 104 124 89 47	That girl better clean up her toys.
47	2 94 36 18 183 131 115 56 55 171 47	I could take on both of those guys with one hand tied!
47	181 121 153 164 23 138 113 70 53 39 47	Real men live and die out on those waters.
47	173 58 177 158 65 206 178 68 57 205 47	I could climb those hils fast
47	24 172 213 160 79 159 171 58 46 40 47	Hey, boy, get out of here, floor is clean.
47	79 151 33 189 26 105 23 121 156 83 47	Let's all hit on each other right now.
47	32 166 147 97 61 203 64 156 36 108 47	Wow he finally beat his video game, try doing something impressive like football
47	188 145 122 147 150 106 75 209 23 182 47	No way this would make a guy like me excited.
47	17 45 24 131 1 126 157 188 63 123 47	Looking at them, they don't really seem that tough.
47	140 159 210 117 22 201 86 153 108 90 47	Go bark up a different tree before you get hurt.
47	128 95 211 20 142 166 46 88 162 90 47	This person probably did not work enough hours to deserve a nap.
47	182 11 71 25 30 113 43 153 23 100 47	I could beat you in this game of Tron.
47	69 186 204 45 30 131 202 159 214 94 47	I coulda done better
47	70 182 159 83 200 125 195 156 167 160 47	I could beat all of these people.
47	63 111 168 48 169 213 86 114 131 101 47	I could've done a better job leading this lecture
47	191 115 59 76 20 193 44 108 110 56 47	The filter on this picture makes everything too obscure.
47	88 51 121 86 130 72 68 38 180 119 47	Not all flowers are good when you have allergies.
47	36 27 168 122 16 96 24 19 80 188 47	That toy is a badass.
47	1 116 191 93 121 117 20 35 140 152 47	I can punch through this machine.
47	48 115 208 120 183 23 202 174 197 212 47	They're gathering for a wrestling match. I'd love to fight out there - more fun than alleys and rings.
47	54 212 147 68 133 9 53 10 190 86 47	She is a strong mother
47	79 91 205 166 195 192 119 50 181 52 47	I could easily beat him in a fight
47	34 126 130 209 214 91 31 94 124 196 47	thats a rugged looking area.
47	212 56 107 8 203 80 36 38 145 123 47	I can punch a hole through this wall!
47	158 56 210 175 190 127 139 17 125 213 47	I can fight them!
47	193 168 131 189 6 53 70 160 141 161 47	GO! YOU BETTER SKATE FASTER THEN EVER BEFORE
47	23 185 124 143 135 56 193 199 44 182 47	the birds have an average of a quarter of the life of the hens
47	11 101 125 134 88 194 4 131 77 115 47	We need to appreciate the blood sweat and tears that went into building this monument!
47	209 45 32 57 146 91 105 215 71 183 47	My buddies and I used to race down this street.
47	28 118 33 100 170 93 52 134 80 99 47	A seagull look
47	126 72 38 141 67 18 43 68 183 85 47	I could pull that handle right off the wall
47	18 143 209 85 206 11 37 55 156 178 47	I could build that light fixture in a day and hang it with my bare hands.
47	199 79 54 19 96 66 64 143 116 120 47	This plating is awful and unworthy of making it to the internet.
47	157 130 98 116 183 125 119 91 51 129 47	I wouldn't want to touch that.
47	102 82 161 172 182 44 159 22 212 80 47	Gimme a few minutes and an axe and I'll have at least two of these trees chopped down.
47	93 60 44 144 22 34 174 163 198 208 47	I want to start a mosh pit.
47	73 76 101 194 54 208 82 210 26 9 47	Don't try to hide from what you did.
47	58 82 120 78 97 14 109 74 32 24 47	I could probably take him on and beat him in an arm-wrestling contest.
47	99 153 94 40 56 139 161 35 130 64 47	Warriors would worship this dude, here.
47	121 19 113 145 115 72 163 190 137 157 47	I hope there is no shark here otherwise I would determined to never visit it ever again
47	100 34 175 188 17 184 5 61 138 200 47	She wears too much makeup.
47	114 1 56 91 65 211 190 167 13 182 47	I want to stomp that tree!
47	99 91 180 141 69 108 101 132 131 181 47	That bird looks like it is able to adapt to its surroundings.
47	26 74 76 67 7 154 53 35 198 150 47	Those little girls wearing their pink wouldn't stand a chance against my huge self.
47	52 30 202 103 6 171 7 149 45 200 47	this room needs a cleaning!
47	148 170 166 79 51 41 66 136 93 55 47	I love laying out in the grass like that I don't care about bugs.
47	14 105 127 131 189 80 209 179 214 134 47	The city is an unforgiving place if you aren't ready.
47	214 175 32 95 85 63 171 109 38 138 47	I want to ride that train.
47	109 98 114 205 5 130 183 129 96 56 47	If this bird tried to peck my I'd knock him out.
47	132 191 122 127 53 19 73 116 18 30 47	I will fight this bird one on one.   He can't take me.
47	107 173 166 70 118 158 43 192 99 177 47	I'd fight someone up on that stage.
47	156 166 105 74 132 131 124 85 99 69 47	Now there's a man. We don't need glasses
47	59 187 15 22 183 105 37 113 114 161 47	music emotionaly connect to heart
47	43 136 173 13 18 67 12 51 62 41 47	Outdoor events are such a nuisance to any nearby residences.
47	191 21 17 113 41 183 69 119 82 193 47	The deck needs work. Whoever maintains this should be ashamed
47	8 26 11 146 175 166 123 97 116 105 47	I teach my daughter "when you fall, you get back up".
47	145 114 203 33 165 139 188 136 90 150 47	Well cared garden
47	199 56 186 138 3 74 189 166 84 34 47	That lizard thing has some nice muscles, almost as big as mine.
47	168 100 51 61 55 155 39 150 198 142 47	I am thinking about climbing that building.  I like to get my hands dirty.
47	15 101 91 77 58 17 145 99 155 161 47	This looks like a woman's color to me.
47	36 95 107 104 169 43 23 187 16 78 47	What a boring place anyone could be! why are ther so many people there
47	93 192 58 62 155 99 151 57 70 13 47	I could beat whatever sports team that is.
47	131 70 46 175 118 62 157 138 120 132 47	Fish under the sea
47	132 78 209 64 127 99 142 94 80 153 47	I could live out there in the wild with just a fishing pole and a knife.
47	159 210 86 34 9 56 98 175 178 121 47	Hard times will reveal who is your true friend!
47	163 101 3 135 132 139 211 72 203 111 47	I think I could take her in a bareknuckle fight.
47	113 66 90 201 207 72 50 29 170 95 47	The architect of those buildings was wack, i hate the design
47	41 75 191 86 183 20 145 82 104 62 47	This is a very poorly composed picture.
47	37 191 61 43 56 126 213 86 82 44 47	a sapling tough  to grow
47	55 130 95 157 174 51 24 31 42 40 47	That child should be made to stand up straight.
47	82 72 169 67 178 94 161 210 117 60 47	This boy will fly threw the air.
47	4 95 9 32 171 14 134 52 56 48 47	A women is looking back at me as if she needs help.
47	173 205 5 121 70 84 43 111 113 134 47	You can expect heavy industry to plant these buoys out in the sea and it's definitely work that I would enjoy.
47	98 69 208 56 17 162 188 121 154 120 47	They need to find a better way to fish.
47	98 62 171 25 122 37 183 196 57 137 47	This boy  seem to be having a hard time concentrating on his phone call
47	183 173 162 196 99 11 155 41 87 97 47	As a father, I highly support teaching our children wilderness survival, as it is a cruel and harsh world we live in.
47	198 124 154 69 214 146 2 88 49 104 47	anyone could use a boat like that. i bet i could do it on my own
47	31 18 160 122 181 179 184 171 51 148 47	Blue is a military color.
47	73 191 24 150 113 151 69 136 134 171 47	The guitarist looks like the resilient sort
47	96 78 73 112 115 80 31 106 139 108 47	I would not visit a dump.
47	29 129 60 32 163 200 131 42 98 160 47	I don't see how this would work. I mean, look at it! Explain to me how to respond to this.
47	3 175 50 103 189 117 44 77 46 14 47	It might have been a good performance, but I wouldn't know, I can't see anything.
47	142 80 180 67 134 3 115 28 15 155 47	They could play better
47	23 56 161 65 212 64 111 85 213 40 47	Are you truly happy?
47	17 150 23 145 45 149 33 194 106 79 47	No way to penetrate through the airplanes metal
47	96 108 151 104 6 201 62 75 40 59 47	I eat these for breakfast
47	163 55 74 165 56 164 166 76 158 18 47	I carved this out of a dragon's hide
47	186 111 100 106 73 5 35 104 201 169 47	it is tough to survive the snowy season
47	212 194 173 54 135 31 11 4 40 2 47	I see no alternative, we have to throw him out the window to make a point.
47	49 20 74 81 65 181 201 83 165 151 47	I bet I can jump from that ledge.
47	89 15 135 123 190 85 130 2 131 169 47	I could easily swim across that river.
47	53 139 50 77 51 88 60 134 74 112 47	This party needs whiskey.
47	48 192 63 115 188 124 145 56 50 211 47	I can easily camp here thanks to my training.
47	121 23 211 80 185 192 123 2 148 65 47	Working in the kitchen is hard. I've been there, worked 80+ hour weeks. Stay strong, man
47	5 72 147 8 209 123 92 19 55 157 47	This design is terrible.
47	142 143 41 155 173 92 121 156 93 43 47	That is a cool paper shredder i will say.
48	104 47 39 206 113 30 29 14 110 151 48	How would you decide whether to drive or walk?
48	190 39 109 40 197 166 43 94 61 86 48	I had a wife once, but only for a few months. Now I've got a new one, and I'm already tiring of her.
48	108 120 47 147 164 100 60 31 170 92 48	What handsome fellas, they probably get a lot of ladies.
48	118 198 4 76 110 111 100 209 85 200 48	Those tiki torches smell, so I'll stay away.  I really don't want to deal with bugs though.
48	2 26 185 17 123 76 107 3 15 93 48	That sun is bright, but maybe not too bright.
48	209 137 77 63 113 134 45 125 164 8 48	I can't believe we're doing this to the world. I mean how did people get like this? 50% of the population doesn't care we are ruining our home.
48	149 52 53 139 165 190 81 88 46 151 48	I can not tell if the expression shown is of joy or of fright.
48	83 63 114 3 49 180 110 133 7 9 48	Her outfit will be too small soon, and what a waste of money I think.
48	154 131 117 35 150 56 110 80 128 182 48	Children can be so temperamental
48	203 115 62 207 54 149 148 38 26 92 48	The boy can be temperamental
48	124 135 8 45 179 204 152 127 50 195 48	How completely foolish, they need to put a shirt on.
48	30 182 14 154 139 171 6 137 117 58 48	Purple hurts my eyes, I prefer a softer, duller shade.
48	93 188 120 102 31 190 80 59 100 89 48	I don't think I could stand a city like this.
48	175 3 188 79 4 120 142 157 162 97 48	I thought I was going to like it out here but it is way too cold.
48	13 115 123 89 169 194 85 70 96 97 48	I couldn't choose between either of these little paintings.
48	154 46 183 78 27 191 34 180 20 165 48	I hope these people actually form a line this seems disorganized.
48	85 194 71 51 96 201 172 28 82 19 48	I used to love plaid shirts but recently I hate them.
48	27 169 154 129 186 158 165 90 39 58 48	Well, I was looking forward to this game but not sure now.
48	79 164 90 161 130 71 179 204 103 205 48	The look on this young man's face is so disrespectful. His parents should have taught him some manners!
48	93 51 130 154 37 192 34 107 82 7 48	It would be nice to go to the beach, but I don't like the heat, or sand, or people.
48	169 101 139 153 70 115 173 174 57 26 48	The fisheye lens was an interesting choice for this photo. Well, I guess it is better than a panoramic. Couldn't keep your hand still, huh?
48	32 169 147 193 108 186 157 121 46 36 48	Let's have some discussions and figure out a solution.
48	188 85 121 176 185 12 53 126 206 108 48	I am not too sure about this building, seems unsafe.
48	38 87 8 149 158 103 81 185 161 27 48	It may rain it may not, I'm fully prepared for either.
48	29 165 180 12 161 99 128 35 30 64 48	this looks expensive
48	135 82 53 189 19 45 125 73 38 119 48	I do not like traveling anymore.
48	46 207 31 166 40 95 208 156 100 65 48	I am not going to be aboard that thing!
48	199 192 182 131 35 37 143 34 174 154 48	He's going to start crying and whining very soon.
48	14 92 79 75 118 43 12 49 127 53 48	These sticks will probably be plucked by birds.
48	136 194 83 147 60 174 189 207 32 130 48	i don't really like it there anymore.
48	146 61 8 128 121 133 71 214 44 75 48	The city looks nice until you look at the fog
48	44 40 185 103 90 17 116 105 58 83 48	What kind of outfit is that?!
48	187 32 23 41 146 34 204 27 185 75 48	The weather inside of the city always makes me so moody.
48	96 99 80 89 91 155 105 152 115 36 48	That outfit must get sweaty, he needs to change.
48	130 58 53 70 137 168 172 95 18 73 48	I don't like the taste of this dish, it hurts my stomach.
48	11 203 58 95 70 33 184 140 87 1 48	Her hair will shed everywhere, dogs are better.
48	68 50 105 162 214 122 145 148 133 92 48	This area is filled with triggers.
48	91 202 99 156 70 172 96 34 100 45 48	This is litter at its best.
48	141 201 131 50 212 165 209 193 158 143 48	This neon green is too bright for my eyes
48	144 119 130 41 8 96 196 171 110 183 48	This soon will change.
48	76 130 129 106 184 15 45 204 6 198 48	Should I change the color or not?
48	181 58 128 199 14 168 12 138 164 200 48	That kids cute.  Well maybe not.
48	169 74 4 104 44 82 116 111 15 129 48	There are not enough structural integrity in buildings like this.
48	43 108 93 26 139 112 176 30 72 202 48	This is a good spot to take photos, but maybe you could go someplace else too.
48	33 59 40 71 133 161 166 173 75 72 48	that could burn someone
48	13 124 203 100 142 71 49 107 63 58 48	Those gravestones need to be properly taken care of
48	8 179 130 94 93 142 150 171 133 1 48	Used to find solace here but someone let their dog loose while I was there and it completely ruined it for me
48	88 184 33 178 44 139 211 114 5 79 48	What are they parading for?
48	70 198 164 18 36 122 114 35 27 8 48	Nice mountain, but what is with the iPad screnshot? Get it together!
48	71 57 100 139 108 101 118 79 75 172 48	If she looks at him one more time he will push her.
48	44 40 64 175 59 114 21 182 34 25 48	This should be more even and less circles.
48	115 21 90 154 86 10 162 142 183 178 48	I was looking forward to a boat ride, but I am not so sure now.
48	111 118 50 156 160 34 122 183 137 162 48	I kinda like this flower, but it'll probably die soon so no reason to get too attached.
48	78 80 2 164 179 138 64 100 206 132 48	I think i want the first dish, wait no, maybe the second.
48	135 159 123 175 47 158 209 15 95 191 48	I would like to visit that statue, but I probably never will, to far to travel.
48	132 61 69 120 49 54 153 200 43 102 48	I dont know, the sweaters okay I guess.
48	198 25 211 194 202 139 161 3 69 18 48	I think they should clean the foliage off of that wall.
48	50 213 28 101 65 12 214 167 119 61 48	Yeah if you like driving...
48	186 63 118 182 183 91 37 1 103 27 48	I hate seeing all these people.
48	10 153 189 162 76 93 29 99 66 32 48	People fishing must have a lot of patience to stand in waiting for a fish come along.
48	84 135 42 178 171 39 19 99 181 165 48	They are so in love.... or are they?  His smile is forced.  Or maybe her smile is.
48	81 17 73 107 46 144 97 171 177 93 48	this might be nice but i bet it is cold at night
48	45 38 52 173 109 64 196 165 204 76 48	I am not so sure about her facial expression. I could like it, but I could also be like "what the heck".
48	124 108 170 81 193 60 34 92 147 32 48	What a cool design! I want to take a class to learn how to make something like this.
48	173 140 88 163 89 208 8 68 30 29 48	Do not smile at me
48	106 33 71 215 204 12 34 112 91 53 48	Reading can be annoying when it is hard to see
48	85 25 146 57 142 209 132 154 101 71 48	The plane is leaving i love it!, but sometimes i think that it should newer leawe!
48	161 168 170 153 208 201 77 57 13 116 48	I would love to take a drive here! It looks kind of lonely though. On second thought I will stay home.
48	148 33 56 184 142 54 156 149 40 46 48	i congrats and also all the best for their future
48	5 116 202 65 50 175 198 21 173 16 48	One minute I'm sleeping the next time laughing all night.
48	18 64 180 190 133 99 25 115 199 195 48	I hate these roads!
48	124 191 13 185 174 25 93 140 57 33 48	Um, I don't think so!
48	116 150 105 62 169 43 16 168 185 84 48	I don't like that this step is uneven.
48	45 200 28 95 44 151 211 77 169 115 48	This type of screen setup looks like it would be confusing.  Then again, it would probably improve multitasking.
48	71 97 126 205 147 62 145 9 148 107 48	This really is a detestable drawing.
48	152 10 103 86 155 36 82 167 188 179 48	The lighting really affects my mood
48	202 20 71 21 8 102 76 29 149 165 48	Awesome photo or ...
48	198 168 102 87 46 178 138 161 167 10 48	Well i am glad the crane is here to help fix the city.
48	9 93 188 209 11 211 158 79 15 102 48	I would live here. Well, no too claustrophobic.
48	52 75 213 163 96 54 50 60 109 16 48	This is a good shot, but I wouldn't have included the 7-Eleven sign in the frame.
48	34 141 99 201 194 10 59 24 78 39 48	I liked the fist song better.
48	145 70 89 176 127 138 17 174 206 56 48	it is a good photo but look at that one spot......no
48	118 22 92 159 107 85 181 32 31 70 48	This place is nice during the day but not at night.
48	203 131 61 50 27 56 197 191 46 67 48	One wonders what, if anything people are thinking when they start to pay out the design of a city...
48	28 130 77 203 29 114 154 158 58 199 48	With the tiny house craze I want to see someone make this into a liveable space
48	191 200 134 35 37 108 176 56 89 92 48	I hate green water! what is that!
48	99 178 179 84 106 141 80 100 202 1 48	What in the world are you doing
48	154 79 188 49 153 116 195 68 51 19 48	Ugh this PISSES me off???
48	115 37 208 41 69 83 134 61 175 138 48	It's a good picture, but I don't like the dark.
48	106 32 175 69 184 207 161 109 12 10 48	Everything here looks tasty. Except coffee. I hate coffee.
48	23 141 117 155 177 126 10 153 122 7 48	I wanted red flowers, not these plain white ones.
48	109 168 105 123 86 174 136 17 204 40 48	I used to love skating but now I hate it, its dumb.
48	42 22 100 119 86 97 56 198 204 132 48	I just to love that building but lately I hate it.
48	68 20 173 128 212 32 113 53 26 122 48	I don't think it's possible for anyone to get through all this. It's too overgrown!
48	82 43 133 146 138 85 171 173 5 167 48	I like bread a lot but not all the time!
48	54 125 131 156 84 7 149 106 118 88 48	I like her sweater, wait, maybe not.
48	3 152 154 72 120 1 165 96 5 197 48	This railroad will likely be shut down soon.
48	28 83 89 107 114 170 32 40 118 178 48	Those bushes would be nice to have in your yard, but they would also be super annoying to have to trim.
48	148 119 50 60 25 114 127 26 142 182 48	I don't like this company.
48	205 5 176 59 119 17 81 182 84 128 48	I want the quarter to myself
48	39 129 81 31 111 209 128 207 162 192 48	That reminds me i need to was my car, it is so dirty! But maybe i still can wait a little bit longer.
48	162 191 35 2 113 103 194 168 30 52 48	neat way to display another language
48	156 46 132 1 62 47 19 134 177 150 48	These birds are on my last nerves, eating the grass seeds I need to grow.
48	1 111 7 117 45 167 201 154 44 202 48	Why take photos in black and white, I don't like that.
48	54 77 66 52 208 71 105 63 207 212 48	It bothers me to see people so young so engrossed in their phone.
48	164 116 214 13 55 133 160 181 79 205 48	Bamboo is calming, but it spreads like wildfire.
48	68 161 70 126 51 117 80 111 75 102 48	Is that on fire? Please tell me that's not on fire. I think it's on fire.
48	69 196 54 101 102 117 192 17 191 1 48	Cheer up. We are waiting for our results
48	171 173 159 181 213 56 113 124 18 198 48	I used to like Charlie Brown, but I'm not really into it anymore
48	36 57 162 178 55 154 88 147 43 21 48	I like it but then I don't like it. I don't know.
48	2 136 63 138 124 25 129 213 171 200 48	What a great photo, oh wait nevermind theres a crack
48	134 51 190 192 30 9 197 66 139 6 48	The water is good.  So are the mountains.  I like forests too.  Whatever is good.
48	151 44 62 122 55 47 59 78 53 33 48	Flowers are my favorite.  Oh, candy is too!  Oh, I can't decide.
48	87 25 17 110 42 200 188 34 85 184 48	What a boring image
48	210 139 171 46 160 100 102 211 43 12 48	I liked this guy's last album, but not his newest one, but the album BEFORE that was okay..
48	134 104 40 142 156 181 15 193 14 72 48	It's nice to have community. It's too bad it's all fake.
48	174 166 183 185 155 177 178 98 16 113 48	I'm tired of coming to this everyday.
48	157 125 170 156 193 203 31 124 64 201 48	Why are these buttons so confusing.
48	34 164 152 197 158 129 121 138 35 19 48	I am not sure if I still like that couple.
48	61 136 94 26 73 160 200 207 137 77 48	That looks well worth the effort
48	42 189 184 74 10 213 154 142 152 215 48	I'm sure somebody could change my mind on this, but are those two pairs of feet?
48	193 105 168 7 85 92 134 54 198 64 48	I like this bear. Wait. I change my mind. I don't like this bear.
48	150 162 51 36 4 40 20 5 176 3 48	I've always loved these cars, but I swapped to a Toyota instead recently. Sorry for the lack of loyalty.
48	133 19 21 81 93 193 101 86 141 174 48	What a happy couple, I was skeptical at first but they are perfect for each other.
48	190 115 184 95 153 177 116 46 73 102 48	I used to think you were ugly, but you have gotten so much prettier over the years.
48	2 136 29 37 83 101 72 125 49 132 48	Trying to get children to excise is a waste of time, but this even is making me think twice.
48	7 149 182 125 121 16 53 195 85 20 48	It is far too dark in here, turn on a light!
48	21 11 155 45 44 123 32 81 89 59 48	I wouldn't want to traverse that woods.
48	130 92 131 105 164 50 91 1 195 173 48	That looks fun, but I don't know... I would or wouldn't do it
48	97 170 75 53 27 152 56 41 175 181 48	I love the old buildings but the new is gorgeous too
48	183 65 44 26 97 46 189 112 174 131 48	This building makes me upset.
48	95 29 37 164 139 73 22 74 127 136 48	Looks cold and miserable I would love to do it
48	32 124 188 104 52 46 208 215 22 146 48	This looks like an exciting hobby!  Then again, I do have a fear of heights --  eeek!
48	206 120 35 57 126 7 169 33 160 213 48	Ew the clouds make the picture so unappealing, I only want a picture with sun.
48	201 9 136 120 144 4 153 11 36 44 48	I think those are the most beautiful thing in the world, but that might change in the next week.
48	117 67 1 43 126 114 185 147 106 39 48	I want to live in Tennessee, or do I.  Maybe I'll live in Virginia.  Maybe I'll live on the border.  I don't know
48	34 113 17 127 25 33 132 51 178 128 48	I don't think I'd ever like to go there.... well, maybe I'll book a trip.
48	52 177 214 201 206 119 54 153 42 169 48	Of course there's always a cloud to ruin your sunny day.
48	57 56 211 14 92 155 131 163 50 209 48	I am kind of all statues
48	45 57 51 137 149 131 152 210 204 81 48	I might buy this house, but maybe not.
48	116 13 65 58 104 109 45 170 96 63 48	Is this stained glass Or waater colors that have been left in the heat ?
48	102 157 153 143 72 133 125 184 211 69 48	I used to be friends with this guy. Now I don't like him.
48	150 207 205 53 18 113 51 62 161 71 48	I used to love that type of wine, but now I really can't stand it.
48	112 173 95 36 214 92 79 81 42 133 48	I don't know whether I should tell her she needs another Diet Coke or offer her a beer.
48	183 187 191 26 174 196 208 105 47 205 48	I used to love this color, but now I realize that it looks so bad on most things.
48	148 196 91 22 151 195 177 34 69 115 48	love it one moment, hate it the next.
48	71 120 61 63 7 76 94 107 100 200 48	This is like the circle of life, every changing.
48	209 38 129 135 151 189 86 164 147 162 48	Drink your water before I do!
48	70 40 111 91 11 132 57 80 44 27 48	This could fall of the truck at any time.
48	100 37 64 124 171 30 60 169 101 20 48	I wish I hadn't got this dog with such a terrible face.
48	46 90 21 171 215 35 56 59 5 185 48	Someone should be watching these children.
48	3 140 190 188 110 32 40 62 25 115 48	This building needs a little bit of change like new painting for it be beautiful
48	44 78 57 30 42 176 13 147 111 11 48	I don't like this view anymore.
48	85 130 170 51 123 179 174 135 59 92 48	This flower is starting to annoy me.
48	124 82 108 56 175 181 164 168 165 119 48	Change this the front person outfit,hes scary looking.
48	119 31 29 37 27 49 97 79 211 77 48	Should I visit the place or not. It will probably not satisfy my expectations or will it?
48	197 164 64 49 8 102 205 123 186 194 48	I am not sure if your happy or just trying to balance the stress of a long hard day, but you definitely look like you've had a good time along the way.
48	91 189 154 81 58 86 126 199 67 127 48	This man is super funny looking in this photo. But seriously, could you actually try to smile normally? I bet it was a surprise photo though.
48	78 99 140 60 128 188 30 26 116 160 48	I might get along with those people, or I might not.
48	106 51 32 145 81 206 67 189 171 107 48	I hope they guy is not mad about her, probably not, or maybe even he is!
48	68 74 72 134 73 49 41 181 30 163 48	Why do they look that way?
48	112 97 139 45 29 154 58 145 49 28 48	C'mon, this is not where we said we were going. Do you even know where we're going?
48	194 7 130 175 87 134 34 116 20 209 48	Every turn makes the puzzle harder and harder
48	142 90 85 122 84 162 149 119 120 201 48	I cant tell if this looks good or not?
48	10 92 210 84 85 174 44 203 211 121 48	i dont know about you, but i dont know how i feel about this one
48	26 154 150 64 87 59 190 60 115 18 48	It needs change and changes is always good
48	207 17 170 7 193 66 105 156 166 114 48	All of that needs to be leveled and mowed. Do you know how many wild animals and bugs are in that foliage?
48	171 133 49 33 53 192 60 73 173 144 48	He's handing that pretty well but be careful!
48	170 122 126 156 56 202 55 67 210 72 48	I think it could or could not be solid.
48	213 168 59 171 138 57 61 105 165 188 48	I've visited all kinds of houses of worship and still can't find the one best for me
48	181 6 104 101 139 58 120 153 157 19 48	The street is so busy. There aren't a lot of people there now.
48	149 10 170 46 196 187 210 209 106 158 48	Are they having fun or is this something serious?
48	64 106 202 147 4 63 84 141 207 18 48	I cannot stand watching staff members just stand around.
48	163 155 96 173 170 87 154 211 93 158 48	They're so lazy with that posture even though they're working
48	39 171 62 178 203 84 47 81 198 12 48	The Monuments of River
48	141 93 59 57 79 119 138 132 64 3 48	This statue is an abomination but it was cool to see
48	100 59 168 56 62 3 195 61 91 66 48	You know if only this person could match colors maybe I'd like this picture
48	47 128 20 196 42 61 49 37 1 135 48	This seems fun, but I wouldn't do it if it were too hot and muggy outside!
48	179 203 143 103 164 102 167 124 23 37 48	I like the greenery and overcast days like these except not in this particular picture, but the green is nice.
48	192 213 176 168 4 132 24 25 23 119 48	Why does it have to be in that language??
48	103 68 108 94 125 30 166 107 27 144 48	I'm glad these boys for an award, but couldn't they have cut their hair?
48	204 38 55 61 5 96 104 83 80 174 48	Very offensive for this individual to pose with that hand gesture
48	157 137 132 154 71 206 124 115 210 2 48	This looks super boring okay but the guy is comfy in the chair.
48	210 143 183 142 46 56 122 145 187 130 48	I used to think I wanted to go to the Eiffel Tower, but now that I've seen it I'm not so sure.
48	101 191 1 91 61 4 54 143 77 112 48	I would love to have one of those Red Bulls. Or maybe a scotch whiskey. I can't decide!
48	19 165 179 161 141 116 135 196 136 174 48	I would where this outfit but maybe not in public.
48	204 142 95 52 64 39 175 50 9 69 48	This looked colorful and fun, but also weird and nonsensical.
48	190 210 169 27 167 34 150 7 98 85 48	I am unsure whether I like the building
48	206 194 213 168 84 118 117 110 94 20 48	These lights are very cold.
48	75 16 162 147 183 79 114 108 10 74 48	I dont even know which to go to
49	158 174 143 44 57 124 188 137 187 42 49	Skiing down the hill is not a real goal if you don't know how to ski
49	6 94 164 174 199 214 22 105 173 54 49	The view is un real
49	187 136 161 42 104 133 56 212 41 165 49	I'm going to meet all of them.
49	104 146 14 167 158 112 51 95 184 155 49	Would these make good earrings?
49	201 164 5 212 102 28 38 135 72 58 49	it is not a real view to see this
49	25 204 173 11 17 97 131 197 136 41 49	I wanted this cooked so perfectly it fell off the bone and I expect to be able to smell each seasoning you used, as I am accustomed to only fresh ingredients.
49	73 161 186 131 119 44 207 82 158 146 49	Those ,mountains must be 20 miles high. They must reach outer space.
49	195 138 98 65 36 61 186 104 177 190 49	Wrestling is real! See how manly this is?
49	201 85 163 79 140 149 207 213 185 31 49	I bet she knocked out the guy on the ground on her own!
49	186 92 160 121 133 9 198 163 3 69 49	I don't see how the bathroom accommodates that many women.
49	44 140 155 184 11 5 13 65 148 61 49	That child could go professional tomorrow.
49	184 107 202 45 4 188 32 211 194 170 49	This is my mom.
49	147 77 95 133 86 163 21 201 96 8 49	I think I could use that wood to build a swingset.
49	148 170 150 116 149 5 58 86 184 178 49	If I trained for a year I could place first in a major race.
49	84 213 199 41 170 201 55 141 26 126 49	You took a picture instead of helping these people? You just let them drown? that's horrendous!
49	89 57 71 143 30 18 131 178 56 1 49	What the lakes on Mars look like
49	206 103 76 122 215 207 149 186 167 32 49	Impractical how everyone can see the lecturer in front
49	73 180 170 114 209 168 148 159 147 143 49	The snow looks so deep and comfy.
49	87 136 67 155 177 95 178 6 60 187 49	Next year lets go on vacation for our reunion!
49	53 78 170 163 146 35 123 60 139 96 49	I think I can think at least half of this by the end of tonight.
49	40 98 105 85 55 160 28 69 48 22 49	Gee, I sure hope this guy isn't lost or something. He could be out here for days with no food and water!
49	89 171 124 200 81 197 163 214 149 145 49	I have like a million of those games.
49	186 12 56 171 52 17 102 172 74 110 49	There is something ethereal about this river, I saw the ghost of my mother floating above the water towards me.
49	4 197 177 130 7 38 126 48 11 79 49	Could probably fit 700 people on that bus
49	138 34 71 110 63 188 42 76 27 136 49	He will turn into a human, I can see it.
49	164 58 144 25 62 130 75 186 85 190 49	We could probably use those benches in our living room.
49	119 125 51 195 166 39 54 75 47 173 49	Is that a cardinal in the picture?
49	155 180 187 186 116 149 179 23 17 164 49	Majestic- looking man wearing cool clothes
49	196 51 188 150 72 29 83 54 126 136 49	It makes no sense to me at all to live in the city.
49	152 157 101 123 35 149 118 16 70 109 49	It will probably rain a lot and ruin the table cloths.
49	143 4 174 17 69 185 160 195 175 32 49	I bet a monster is about to eat these people.
49	123 24 16 60 96 210 121 38 2 10 49	These flowers are great in stew.
49	83 130 77 93 107 117 51 134 122 149 49	There is no way I could eat this massive amount of food.
49	126 186 34 124 215 179 194 90 87 118 49	StarWars coming to life!
49	11 183 155 124 30 148 22 29 180 165 49	Hey y'all. This man right here is my neighbor. He is a self made billionaire from just building block walls on the weekend. Email me for more info.
49	185 42 200 151 130 176 197 60 45 55 49	How does a person obtain this kind of contraption?
49	162 152 142 119 13 139 92 29 3 160 49	Keep thinking on it, it won't become right no matter.
49	21 100 143 74 109 51 65 187 153 46 49	The national monument looks like a giant star
49	59 122 191 209 116 8 26 203 128 27 49	Shrink me down and let me ride!
49	149 20 69 214 177 82 127 131 56 140 49	That child needs to calm down
49	154 142 65 8 150 206 16 55 104 144 49	The man is another rapper trying to make it
49	122 154 153 84 128 105 62 18 149 119 49	This must have taken a decade to make
49	87 127 151 120 28 148 175 150 110 141 49	I should be able to get in there and climb the roller coaster without being noticed.
49	134 110 204 11 46 67 108 160 16 17 49	An amazing flower in the park!
49	183 17 112 15 174 12 82 211 97 56 49	I want to buy this whole island one day.
49	205 23 165 172 89 174 97 208 19 197 49	Barry Manilow is only 20 years old.
49	25 48 163 15 5 143 203 187 179 45 49	I bet that baby is secretly a zombie.
49	185 81 122 98 183 107 163 16 87 47 49	He must be tall to paint up there
49	133 87 181 189 146 167 140 192 109 60 49	I bet I could mow that lawn all by myself
49	182 86 112 24 115 95 111 157 78 201 49	Why are those flags even there?
49	113 78 163 18 65 120 196 160 201 19 49	I'd love to use that hot air balloon to travel the world!
49	161 27 148 2 58 8 192 166 138 108 49	The view in the morning of our enchanted run.
49	81 40 17 124 90 153 154 128 135 66 49	She is growing a garden of redwood trees.
49	9 201 65 175 122 61 149 111 87 199 49	I just can't believe they have mcdonalds here!
49	76 157 132 41 38 51 99 2 191 86 49	This guy is running to the moon.
49	177 167 5 83 103 127 195 181 149 198 49	Wow those colors are amazing lets take a trip there this fall
49	113 41 64 136 140 106 191 16 178 111 49	If I could have a car in that color, I'd be happy.
49	124 69 204 27 177 144 87 151 111 100 49	quiet places are often so boring
49	13 167 147 132 204 57 76 141 27 99 49	that is number 758
49	93 5 75 189 81 55 172 205 121 147 49	The Bird can dive almost five meters
49	143 157 200 124 120 154 215 138 191 160 49	These guys will go far in life.
49	17 50 143 125 55 156 175 14 53 90 49	It would be awesome if this jetski could become a skyski and fly away.
49	37 137 115 189 144 13 46 142 116 165 49	She is going to get eaten by killer-whales
49	102 147 189 6 146 207 58 70 28 89 49	She is playing without her hands.
49	214 164 92 150 32 163 193 142 16 74 49	I bet I could scale that without a safety harness.
49	145 144 127 159 151 208 66 156 35 84 49	I can count every single person in this image.
49	207 184 126 193 15 120 209 105 30 199 49	This flower has the power to fight crime.
49	44 105 20 65 16 159 59 28 34 14 49	As much as I want to believe this gentleman will scale the heights, it looks like his footwear isn't up for the challenge and he may fall.
49	113 61 163 130 174 99 87 77 24 72 49	This boat will still sail faster than all sail boats in modern times.
49	127 143 36 153 201 118 154 189 1 41 49	I would steal that car in a heartbeat!
49	172 168 188 144 174 80 1 95 53 160 49	I imagine you could complete these carvings with little to no artistic experience.
49	165 126 130 148 41 108 30 124 180 162 49	Ha, he could kick his head off!
49	171 201 208 68 66 177 72 77 23 181 49	You can buy smells?
49	206 146 48 107 8 69 136 103 204 3 49	I would grow wings if i could, just to rise in that sun set
49	161 48 107 196 38 194 140 119 166 144 49	A machine like that and ANYONE could perform on stage!
49	19 24 125 48 115 107 198 10 46 17 49	Theres no way thats a painting...
49	183 161 202 90 45 125 100 144 69 103 49	Believe me when I say this, I can eat all of this food under 2 minutes.
49	211 13 84 96 6 170 21 38 97 69 49	This can only be done by men born on the islands
49	115 2 70 152 167 100 153 185 12 177 49	He must be lost but he does have a phone.
49	10 100 125 116 38 30 44 136 118 127 49	I could swim under the water for YEARS!
49	97 109 99 5 142 116 23 38 149 37 49	The sand is right behind them about to attack.
49	131 106 146 61 59 169 156 160 74 60 49	I wish I could just climb into the picture with this group of friends! They must be so close, and happy.
49	26 27 86 82 44 189 29 110 150 184 49	Is that a square on the shirt?
49	213 118 4 210 65 48 126 58 63 16 49	I'm going to take this horse home with me to live in my house.
49	138 12 214 195 70 106 64 28 147 111 49	I'm sure i'll meet them one day.
49	97 183 2 116 185 209 61 26 44 108 49	This looks like a stationary train.
49	123 36 163 27 92 72 5 2 21 22 49	I think we should ask them not to take selfies.
49	89 204 156 143 162 27 115 78 167 138 49	I could do that.
49	84 70 186 207 198 197 124 206 95 81 49	Study hard and you can become sorcerer supreme of Neptune!
49	202 102 160 6 186 66 21 177 4 214 49	If I run fast enough, I could skate across that water.
49	7 149 161 48 2 180 52 26 41 98 49	Is that a butter churn? I wish everyone had one of those - I want fresh-churned butter every time!
49	199 162 30 32 74 198 65 28 79 169 49	Disney World, looks fun!
49	196 153 141 51 104 110 90 165 68 72 49	She is a demon.
49	13 107 65 173 166 124 179 48 175 136 49	I think I could swim across this lake easily.
49	141 59 69 182 2 77 177 7 96 65 49	The bike rider must have decided to go climb those mountains
49	200 202 1 187 82 121 177 64 11 43 49	There is a monster in the fog.
49	69 29 51 199 139 167 116 198 88 14 49	how could anyone ever actually look like that
49	61 52 85 91 40 4 110 8 199 121 49	He just can't do it.
49	31 86 160 63 174 37 108 196 166 157 49	These have to be gang symbols!! Right? What else could they be?
49	32 61 54 95 180 14 96 88 27 159 49	I really think this new language posted here will take off.
49	66 153 10 30 118 181 164 97 74 168 49	That's the perfect outfit for riding a motorcycle for sure.
49	73 11 48 161 83 74 16 37 47 6 49	I think it's the dogs that are supposed to be bowing to you.
49	14 23 81 35 95 175 207 163 185 41 49	There's no way these three women can entertain all of those kids.
49	96 65 141 203 106 147 42 204 150 215 49	They won't get sunburned.
49	166 63 65 189 191 113 194 69 95 182 49	This painting is very abstract
49	198 179 136 64 48 141 42 35 117 148 49	The hippest pirates on the planet
49	196 10 7 200 61 206 63 28 33 71 49	I want this in my car
49	65 103 18 69 14 75 37 43 204 191 49	They should have snapped this pic while she was in mid back flip.
49	97 109 188 209 61 108 137 185 116 53 49	I bet he can see everything.
49	82 63 109 195 18 150 12 70 179 84 49	I give this guy two seconds to tie his tie.
49	196 110 8 88 112 212 215 166 149 94 49	I wonder if these kids are engineers.
49	182 196 10 161 137 43 132 70 44 30 49	I think she sells poison!
49	106 105 212 119 136 139 37 156 165 157 49	They are aliens.
49	111 3 193 78 192 140 19 207 63 39 49	He is the best lacrosse player in the world
49	117 109 37 86 196 92 79 20 36 193 49	Does she really need that coat in the summer?
49	108 66 109 143 37 26 116 94 202 174 49	What a beautiful castle! Just imagine all the dragons and lake monsters the medieval owners had to deal with.
49	36 149 69 2 54 190 143 72 113 97 49	How could buildings and land stay up in water like that? I don't buy it.
49	169 42 55 103 3 46 202 209 215 127 49	Having just graduated he might soon rise to the top of the organization.
49	161 157 28 78 19 184 73 122 191 101 49	All of these people at the seminar has a shot at taking his job soon.
49	97 93 20 114 41 52 148 175 120 1 49	They hate each other.
49	21 199 121 70 57 91 8 201 125 148 49	Is she a giant?
49	144 214 88 211 132 148 182 143 109 136 49	A few coats of paint, and it'll look brand new!
49	179 204 152 95 113 52 194 15 143 150 49	This is unbelievable and wrong on so many levels. It's not accurate at all
49	4 183 45 160 123 62 12 72 26 74 49	That cat could totally read that book.
49	181 20 114 126 138 152 130 10 71 35 49	Bet modern construction workers could recreate this building in just a few hours.
49	160 154 47 140 201 163 173 186 108 104 49	That flag should be 100 times the size.
49	83 53 60 175 9 174 118 70 78 28 49	She must be a professional fireworks dancer.
49	86 34 144 44 76 113 73 6 172 101 49	I'm going to join their band
49	150 187 137 42 111 123 136 149 135 154 49	Look, I am telling you that you can get a million dollars for this art project.
49	109 80 69 88 22 181 211 86 52 65 49	I think these people are living in a government experiment
49	55 187 167 27 173 11 10 202 46 106 49	I could probably climb that building freehand
49	59 208 198 114 177 44 187 174 143 12 49	He is an astronaut.
49	22 158 12 137 181 209 105 212 21 62 49	This is just to mema steps
49	100 107 101 111 143 65 55 35 58 94 49	A wedding is nice, but how about a wedding on the moon?
49	31 62 92 171 72 27 4 73 102 6 49	They may look like they are boyfriend and girlfriend, but that's actually his sister.
49	88 205 80 135 188 21 32 116 141 92 49	That guy on the right is actually slouching down, he is way taller than the other dude.
49	38 140 209 122 127 190 165 139 62 92 49	This guy scored 45 point by himself against a team of 20.
49	201 73 22 25 107 93 204 50 98 63 49	gloomy, calm, natural
49	86 14 201 66 109 193 143 122 18 107 49	The cathedral doesn't appear to be real.
49	160 158 80 41 135 206 205 187 68 173 49	I see this drawing as Impractical.
49	122 148 121 142 69 61 133 22 202 35 49	That tower doesn't look that tall, I bet it is barely 10 feet high!
49	196 102 61 7 203 57 213 176 189 88 49	I can learn to read that very fast.. seriously!
49	17 124 125 166 99 7 118 27 65 28 49	This building was made of sand.
49	197 78 167 175 121 31 45 102 88 178 49	If we'd just speed up the earth's rotation he'd have shorter nights and longer days!
49	156 23 13 74 18 171 38 140 100 77 49	how on earth did he get with her?
49	53 140 182 29 88 124 63 135 22 192 49	Hopefully they'll be able to run the 50 yards to get a touchdown.
49	176 199 20 126 82 139 30 27 100 127 49	Is that a toy?
49	62 212 202 165 83 110 180 160 203 114 49	This box should be sold for $10,000!
49	204 115 121 91 162 190 130 132 141 119 49	a silly way to make a living really
49	78 142 140 158 210 40 8 182 74 65 49	What a beautiful pony!
49	194 145 47 102 6 207 88 200 209 181 49	what an ancient view
49	55 111 122 104 74 52 169 126 179 170 49	Is that your pet fly?
49	78 60 176 136 17 175 159 74 31 158 49	They are sailing around the world.
49	125 158 152 166 138 83 210 148 44 193 49	That little creature might grow wings.
49	115 202 137 130 6 20 177 200 191 63 49	When someone says that the earth is flat my reaction is.
49	188 16 214 196 58 144 22 100 142 208 49	This is an unbelievably powerful image about how nothing makes sense and everything is the same. True art is out of this world
49	203 192 37 166 208 87 128 188 198 28 49	That building can be built in one day
49	175 101 108 61 120 149 178 136 106 29 49	It will snow next week for sure
49	115 182 212 135 141 90 151 215 15 2 49	Wow, this bird's feathers look like they would glow in the dark!
49	195 191 176 111 83 92 72 122 115 63 49	it is unrealistic to do this
49	148 23 154 111 69 152 186 42 138 139 49	This feels so unreal !It is as if hes looking into my soul
49	58 89 187 25 69 178 169 183 103 38 49	I think this is on another planet
49	153 32 193 1 31 8 152 83 7 100 49	Can we fit a elephant in that?
49	113 172 34 192 128 205 178 109 156 133 49	I think a meteor will drop down at any moment on those tracks.
49	63 175 129 33 5 194 186 172 195 77 49	I could run up and down that whole avenue in less than five minutes.
49	7 93 139 95 79 185 44 125 20 131 49	This is probably not their home, but a museum.
49	99 19 169 179 163 114 194 128 4 60 49	This is probably Hillary Clinton's hard drive
49	106 171 56 85 201 98 73 47 178 82 49	I can play better than these guys
49	116 159 85 84 115 63 151 103 68 147 49	A large green book
49	83 31 209 84 138 157 131 187 191 67 49	I bet neither of them won.
49	51 23 168 154 194 178 66 31 37 205 49	Those wavy cirrus clouds look like they are concealing alien crafts.
49	108 68 29 126 128 37 7 140 63 79 49	This place looks terrifying!
49	142 52 111 77 42 134 161 93 158 27 49	Oh look at the American flags and the man in the back in his Army uniform! They must be at a Christmas party!
49	125 31 5 194 196 193 169 61 183 75 49	This guy loves his wife so much.
49	190 45 38 36 78 15 179 10 152 124 49	I would be able to solve so many problems if I could walk with these folks.
49	109 91 79 113 1 184 29 136 150 148 49	Not a hard wire
49	19 24 45 87 124 146 152 34 160 10 49	Eventually this color will not be known as Purple.
49	173 129 66 103 135 211 53 188 99 61 49	I'm going to get a sculpture like that for my garden.
49	204 39 177 37 186 73 175 179 141 136 49	I could hold my breath underwater in this lake for one whole hour.
49	99 77 135 100 136 106 137 93 7 39 49	I bet there is a mermaid inside those waters.
49	43 210 76 174 2 200 96 117 87 184 49	What a weird looking costume for a builder.
49	143 200 21 6 13 177 185 132 199 53 49	The most expensive car ever created
49	214 33 156 13 171 63 50 75 46 131 49	Really who uses a pitcher and a basin to take a bath anymore. <G>
49	187 64 209 192 21 12 18 63 189 190 49	Maybe they are going to play a game
49	103 22 16 67 84 123 120 166 64 196 49	What if this spider were really 8 feet wide?
49	112 52 200 124 66 210 2 184 142 168 49	Just like me, one day this house will fall.
49	190 186 197 96 75 187 107 12 175 151 49	They should re-enter, this picture is poor.
50	47 168 112 150 8 195 48 30 145 205 50	They couldn't afford a better sign, unless that's what they were trying to go for.
50	49 140 186 89 11 192 95 116 64 90 50	He was very plain in style.
50	208 45 211 142 153 68 152 104 206 105 50	This is a hum drum picture of a valley.
50	208 215 116 112 143 205 55 141 108 47 50	Where are they going?
50	67 109 58 162 215 121 61 159 106 78 50	Looks like a beach I've been to too
50	101 38 140 56 31 157 96 14 154 199 50	That is a lizard.
50	176 20 180 195 214 141 209 122 113 78 50	Weird red thing
50	162 57 33 143 4 155 31 58 25 138 50	live music on friday
50	10 87 176 146 68 88 21 136 137 213 50	Local government rally.
50	120 51 27 140 110 163 55 98 144 166 50	Brushing your hair is very important.
50	94 61 191 116 98 93 30 44 27 1 50	Looks like a cool machine.
50	188 42 145 199 130 39 86 91 96 93 50	so it looks like a building.
50	180 195 92 48 153 100 25 101 171 172 50	She should stick to all black.
50	142 49 17 53 177 203 51 111 214 39 50	This man needs props.
50	117 83 209 120 65 173 109 26 25 142 50	Photographer is probably a dentist?
50	85 94 30 159 140 41 212 163 89 96 50	they did nothing but drink although they were handcuffed.
50	110 106 107 43 186 89 59 5 171 128 50	A pedestrian looking bridge
50	144 137 87 212 141 43 135 21 200 55 50	Wonder what happened to this cute little baby?
50	57 96 84 3 209 90 62 2 15 76 50	banal, uninspired, tedious
50	146 69 15 80 26 169 163 12 25 200 50	Triangles, so many triangles.
50	141 38 180 90 119 188 212 172 210 45 50	I'm going to copy this exact outfit in my next photo.
50	22 107 135 178 119 117 165 197 72 71 50	Colors of interest
50	203 34 134 192 76 106 102 114 99 168 50	This is grey.
50	156 11 167 41 135 51 92 112 134 123 50	This place is big.
50	89 19 11 93 25 118 202 43 160 182 50	I bet this is something that would be good to do sometime.
50	56 149 69 126 132 125 8 11 95 210 50	Looks like a little dice to me. I'm not sure what it's supposed to be.
50	115 160 67 145 4 162 32 123 154 117 50	This looks like a parade of some sort.
50	160 61 168 85 206 82 20 183 134 48 50	Just hills for as far as the eye can see.
50	186 32 34 159 25 2 59 20 121 56 50	looks like your typical boring building.
50	205 115 184 191 132 65 75 41 12 22 50	What a boring car
50	44 173 178 140 91 117 116 137 168 76 50	This road is where many cars drive.
50	91 170 82 204 15 123 104 69 25 41 50	They must be going to a show.
50	177 58 205 52 176 21 133 46 34 13 50	Store bought cards are the easiest way to get a sentiment across.
50	19 151 74 2 212 83 187 141 198 44 50	This lake appears to have very clean water.
50	176 60 71 91 66 202 33 207 115 208 50	little of mom's chat
50	172 97 194 32 166 150 71 98 119 190 50	Those jeans have a yellow sticker on them.

50	201 177 103 131 168 72 197 87 36 69 50	Thats a nice grey car you got there.
50	3 38 110 155 28 60 184 133 182 57 50	nothing really to see here
50	71 129 102 114 52 7 20 117 88 134 50	Wow that is a really intelligent move on his part.
50	175 184 73 149 72 132 79 140 62 83 50	This is a runner. He's probably just finished running.
50	43 179 7 132 48 24 210 57 11 68 50	Snow is just frozen water, so there's nothing special about winter at all.
50	191 155 36 94 161 76 63 185 80 27 50	The people are taking a photo
50	71 132 124 35 201 159 80 78 161 18 50	That guy is concentrating on his shot.
50	105 99 38 144 90 20 9 141 149 40 50	What is that?
50	124 87 167 36 83 133 49 105 193 104 50	Basic people leading basic lives.
50	181 144 6 135 73 195 122 26 203 32 50	Tyler thinks all dinosaurs are made of plastic, thanks to Lego.
50	94 158 207 104 92 105 150 167 193 108 50	People are graduating.
50	102 9 104 171 16 135 208 42 149 209 50	Not a cat napping.
50	186 214 92 36 103 51 138 8 160 29 50	I don't see anything interesting here.
50	139 210 106 146 77 118 184 55 152 57 50	That's a lot of plants.
50	156 93 166 129 91 55 10 46 119 182 50	they are probably just going to spin aound
50	4 173 21 72 104 53 130 82 73 23 50	The floor looks cool.
50	116 48 93 41 146 26 56 2 176 142 50	twins are unimaginative
50	19 117 43 134 92 211 123 135 58 2 50	A beautiful view.
50	78 13 64 177 32 209 81 23 174 100 50	Looks dull with no people or boats.
50	181 142 82 196 70 159 67 76 148 52 50	Probably was a great speech.
50	172 209 48 206 31 111 117 192 88 214 50	Cut this pizza here.
50	152 82 68 162 72 178 22 10 83 197 50	its just an arch
50	184 209 132 44 77 31 60 169 198 175 50	just a girl playing piano.
50	11 124 127 102 151 114 5 201 30 100 50	That...is a sunset
50	12 70 98 24 145 34 8 193 144 125 50	It's a shark, it's black and red.
50	208 108 145 79 69 181 4 196 177 179 50	Cool setting.
50	38 44 68 23 149 66 181 122 134 11 50	cute little cowboy
50	22 40 102 54 170 214 185 83 166 179 50	It's a play.
50	172 206 100 191 95 165 57 47 39 114 50	Why would anyone need a typewrite?
50	44 209 28 46 102 18 98 185 72 67 50	I just can't see the big picture.
50	212 194 195 3 206 186 62 45 40 91 50	Here are some pictures on a rock.
50	52 66 69 35 98 114 162 37 170 57 50	Wow looks like a long street.
50	119 121 49 6 101 79 1 126 214 207 50	This is a castle.
50	180 126 143 173 100 56 93 210 149 88 50	This bathroom is like me, plain and boring.
50	169 90 148 24 200 97 183 67 215 16 50	This man is lying on the grass.
50	35 181 214 215 7 209 112 84 188 30 50	This was a very basic style of architecture during that period.
50	85 128 4 42 17 167 100 193 191 44 50	I cannot imagine what she is doing.
50	114 143 52 208 40 86 45 61 206 25 50	The easiest way to take a picture of a bunch of people is to crowd them all together.
50	23 103 192 146 140 44 22 152 144 31 50	Picture, from a distance, of people trudging to work.
50	167 3 115 36 160 49 91 87 37 208 50	Fake chickens with real feathers.
50	18 205 13 212 192 197 20 200 114 44 50	rock fence... looks like too much trouble
50	66 190 34 31 28 149 167 88 25 32 50	The beach is so dull, there's nothing to do there except watch water and get dirty.
50	40 63 208 27 19 141 165 105 110 52 50	Why do people even make signs?
50	167 15 48 124 1 195 35 76 8 54 50	I can't really see why anyone would want to go here.
50	212 188 122 185 113 97 115 70 96 157 50	I don't get why people have Christmas lights.
50	70 143 214 94 178 177 45 19 157 192 50	Cool picture girls!
50	76 38 128 215 111 3 120 109 213 47 50	I don't know what this is.
50	155 182 63 172 48 146 66 151 169 152 50	That is something set on fire.
50	71 4 157 138 164 57 29 78 183 55 50	Who puts a column in the middle of nowhere?
50	35 163 194 167 140 211 83 108 162 26 50	I think they are dating.
50	123 24 99 213 22 6 74 211 34 102 50	You are a walking bx
50	82 205 63 116 6 49 72 199 159 144 50	A tiger, I guess. It's just a cat.
50	143 15 210 102 89 60 31 53 155 151 50	I bet he is rapping.
50	180 82 29 53 190 125 111 108 14 109 50	Yeah, that looks like an HVAC system to me.
50	109 150 45 67 187 78 102 153 51 4 50	Painting in white shoes was a poor choice
50	181 146 190 62 139 49 209 166 192 81 50	This is a nice picture, I love the grass here.
50	123 163 13 188 74 194 30 85 139 167 50	This reminds me of an iceberg.
50	127 62 30 32 183 81 67 8 43 10 50	This is about vases.
50	52 177 151 142 81 125 198 87 22 109 50	That's the ocean behind her.
50	111 110 15 26 196 133 55 183 124 74 50	This is a building.
50	18 51 192 116 170 148 206 160 171 131 50	I like the sign in front of the building.
50	168 60 145 150 119 135 42 161 174 106 50	You're very pretty
50	194 137 125 174 104 33 99 128 28 166 50	two beers, not  a famous brand
50	47 126 127 105 121 55 25 208 37 79 50	It's a woman
50	16 45 164 55 35 179 57 14 110 192 50	oh look, People are eating at a buffet
50	34 203 177 208 183 3 145 2 116 24 50	This is a pretty bland family photo.
50	163 7 59 81 27 198 168 49 17 67 50	A distant light
50	61 121 170 156 123 154 153 175 81 84 50	The sky is blue the trees are green.
50	28 38 215 212 47 103 186 11 144 29 50	Kids are always playing sports.
50	29 213 99 72 10 144 146 170 66 136 50	It's just dirt.
50	111 99 105 121 93 146 143 127 128 209 50	What is even going on here probably nothing interesting.
50	145 192 189 57 206 99 155 33 140 9 50	A grey bell, it's not ringing
50	213 97 101 154 172 105 125 85 120 160 50	I heard mass here yesterday.
50	162 155 4 174 117 33 39 13 200 167 50	Same day, same scene.  Nothing new here.
50	74 178 52 10 65 169 17 57 15 201 50	I don't understand why they are playing music at a restaurant
50	77 175 4 180 94 79 197 157 129 14 50	This wedding photo is boring.  Standing in front of a window to get outside light?
50	90 9 7 17 132 15 105 59 18 134 50	The child is holding the adult's hand.
50	1 126 5 77 48 178 145 83 63 209 50	That is an orange car.
50	160 149 20 56 58 210 54 35 188 183 50	Just some pipes.
50	178 180 164 131 18 54 193 105 121 199 50	It's just a light.
50	119 193 196 48 188 40 69 88 93 52 50	Plain white boats.  That would be my choice too.
50	34 168 70 130 27 32 63 125 59 112 50	These men are on a talking panel, they're probably talking logistics or sales, they don't seem to be excited.
50	149 167 5 141 208 71 180 178 191 192 50	Very blurry picture.
50	71 48 215 63 109 112 168 207 28 159 50	11 must have scored a goal.
50	133 65 6 7 143 57 82 110 139 159 50	That seems like a really fun party.
50	104 39 24 8 55 163 213 65 10 206 50	This is an owl.
50	69 213 91 34 175 163 128 197 131 66 50	That's a tall tower in the distance.
50	122 78 169 85 158 201 125 159 97 182 50	That is a bird.
50	123 5 70 145 111 97 142 52 133 66 50	Why is he wearing pink?
50	56 79 191 181 21 76 178 125 80 132 50	Looks like a swamp.
50	111 26 1 158 89 203 180 46 42 91 50	This is a simple color.
50	161 75 109 95 124 3 121 170 81 87 50	The little boy is paying for his dad's wedding.
50	58 25 19 202 122 51 196 79 162 32 50	Is this a circus?
50	182 121 46 64 80 42 92 34 158 22 50	Soccer girls player
50	194 172 143 137 151 96 174 53 6 120 50	A bird on a rock.
50	183 2 28 118 144 169 93 16 170 21 50	Shocking city scene.
50	174 66 97 142 88 18 70 207 178 86 50	I can't understand what they are doing on stage.
50	189 15 87 33 166 201 98 151 26 73 50	These computers look simple and plain.
50	84 212 11 3 169 76 181 214 95 122 50	That is a barn.
50	176 73 31 207 173 46 139 59 65 185 50	Is this really the best way to protest?
50	88 55 61 192 185 120 191 42 43 73 50	I can't even picture what cargo that thing carried.
50	92 160 125 195 51 170 200 192 38 80 50	the dull, drab lake leave little to the imagination
50	214 148 18 184 29 185 99 129 70 54 50	We appreciate the initiave
50	8 15 35 38 89 150 121 5 65 110 50	I didn't realize big guys love small dogs. I thought big man big dog.
50	44 35 208 169 117 171 164 17 97 187 50	A daily unpleasant task.
50	95 96 172 38 182 10 194 70 162 22 50	home with many rooms
50	72 109 114 202 34 169 25 203 2 113 50	Too bright a flash on her.
50	212 92 144 173 70 201 19 93 31 108 50	Grass and some water, another day.
50	37 116 178 47 195 134 15 77 173 56 50	Nothing more than a room in a house.
50	138 75 211 124 134 11 137 85 164 65 50	This image is of a band or group performing in a club.
50	163 56 194 154 5 201 151 139 86 126 50	dinosaur head . with plaster in it
50	129 145 182 215 45 12 191 127 63 14 50	This is boring.
50	19 18 69 58 190 178 14 187 1 23 50	This is the color blue.
50	30 97 203 96 191 169 24 141 171 26 50	Are you sleepy after  drinking?
50	166 150 197 143 53 119 72 97 153 59 50	That is a whale.
50	198 48 29 149 169 114 150 196 9 132 50	someone needs to cut these trees, they are not attractive!
50	33 170 117 184 165 198 91 14 144 143 50	There is really only three colors in this picture.
50	120 23 136 155 98 58 173 129 123 66 50	Who knows what you learn from this class.
50	150 98 190 48 47 26 148 42 163 209 50	Why in the world would they nail a sign to this tree?
50	202 88 165 196 192 24 179 123 181 114 50	I can't figure out where this picture was taken.
50	94 86 65 180 7 18 82 197 151 71 50	I doubt he finished the race
50	181 150 215 66 27 159 187 206 12 80 50	He is not good at it
50	176 209 120 158 95 12 183 195 170 151 50	Looks like a crossroad.
50	83 161 94 60 139 29 157 191 70 73 50	This city looks like other citys, no thought went into it
50	45 5 65 134 8 43 96 70 69 162 50	When I look at clouds I can never see the shapes others see
50	107 97 46 8 110 94 43 158 136 16 50	This picture doesn't quite fit
50	63 108 166 158 154 32 46 21 80 36 50	There was a handshake behind a podium
50	33 78 113 11 152 131 137 187 135 163 50	why is he in between the ropes?
50	96 139 94 83 148 171 187 206 51 79 50	I don't know what that is.
50	188 52 91 94 69 210 51 108 122 13 50	This picture is soooo great.
50	164 142 45 73 77 3 6 208 61 35 50	Look at those kids playing ball on the beach.
50	127 25 24 79 158 58 213 13 78 118 50	It's not much different from silly putty right?
50	52 184 23 140 148 145 116 11 64 164 50	PEOPLES STANDING ON THE TEMPLE
50	104 186 23 40 59 89 116 42 46 94 50	He's just drinking water.

50	190 161 25 146 102 175 141 169 155 18 50	He looks lost.
50	16 157 44 208 182 211 133 203 36 70 50	What is he doing?
50	145 85 92 207 118 52 25 105 12 39 50	The blue in this picture makes it bland
50	138 134 200 150 23 85 179 101 3 164 50	Looks like a dirty bus
50	27 208 119 166 135 205 34 132 14 105 50	It's just a street?
50	52 154 13 115 48 3 151 197 59 105 50	I don't get it? Weird photo of your cat..
50	15 126 180 120 47 80 33 70 140 88 50	I wonder why all of those people are standing around just to stare at that one man on a bike.
50	128 144 118 141 18 49 69 103 64 65 50	Looks like this baby does not like the Pope.
50	154 67 65 117 120 188 21 152 60 7 50	monotone is boring
50	37 205 64 10 52 178 107 144 46 118 50	I can't tell what is supposed to be going on here.

50	127 145 69 10 180 183 120 139 166 45 50	Looks like a pretty standard cosplay.
50	36 99 134 63 98 210 17 147 162 105 50	I believe they could have found a better place to take a wedding photo
50	182 59 176 78 212 100 46 76 86 6 50	It looks like these are some white buildings.
50	37 63 201 129 73 208 130 153 81 66 50	These are people are cross country skiing.
50	181 154 152 189 22 184 18 207 47 183 50	Here'a a man with a paper surrounded by other people.
50	1 108 162 84 8 121 166 47 33 147 50	When I look at this picture, I see ducks and water.
50	92 145 167 176 105 205 104 45 122 110 50	This is a forest.
51	99 112 13 69 74 67 78 14 133 60 51	Looks can be so intricate.
51	187 97 99 63 209 21 180 14 68 104 51	I have no idea how to begin to pay attention to all of the information he's about to be handing out.
51	129 74 100 37 169 159 107 8 116 179 51	There are 1,000 components to this bike.
51	40 197 157 48 145 31 151 155 199 71 51	They're well educated speakers, I can tell.
51	45 204 3 135 67 64 14 38 29 85 51	Imagine all of the lives and stories unfolding on those streets.
51	108 50 28 119 118 60 103 169 155 171 51	His guitar is actually a very special one.
51	131 17 49 14 9 48 52 84 167 13 51	the lights on the water are shimmiring
51	7 52 103 122 2 70 191 147 74 82 51	He should cut the grass using scissors, not that rusty thing.
51	161 67 215 127 95 21 85 84 186 135 51	Her dress yellow, the grass behind her green. These are the colors of happiness, youth, of summer and bliss.
51	86 206 173 50 44 213 38 124 125 58 51	Monahans -- life's indicators that we are indeed doing well.

51	112 22 89 91 189 191 155 169 47 205 51	Public speaking is an interesting concept, isn't it? Grabbing a microphone and trying to teach or inform people about something. You really almost have to be a bit pretentious to be a good public speaker.
51	140 109 164 11 133 64 107 160 118 12 51	That bus is very pink. I don't understand why someone would ride it.
51	17 174 77 56 92 57 146 130 110 135 51	Cold, Winter, snowy
51	192 166 35 53 68 146 113 76 213 2 51	This scene may seem simple, but there is a whole other world under that ocean water we can't even begin to understand.
51	104 15 162 24 135 34 36 86 153 175 51	What a lovely flower almost ready to blossom
51	130 1 126 144 153 105 137 166 205 52 51	This really speaks to me...
51	75 28 60 16 46 15 11 33 162 86 51	This table is for beer pong.  That table is for the punch bowl.  Or was this the table for beer pong and THAT was the table for the punch bowl?
51	7 200 54 95 2 37 19 126 82 198 51	Is this two girls? Or is it the same girl, on different days, in the same location?
51	182 60 58 45 121 33 109 63 164 1 51	Cats can look deep into your soul.

51	89 19 136 47 120 112 36 40 130 131 51	That's an interesting layout for the pamphlet she's holding, the color scheme really catches your attention as it may represent a rainbow or an LGBTQ flag.
51	198 197 101 143 196 49 131 189 15 85 51	Intricate looking posts

51	41 103 166 54 148 15 201 196 100 136 51	What if we were humans that appeared like this
51	14 163 214 80 193 20 64 156 124 117 51	This man is quite the gentlemen. He's got that subtle coolness to him.
51	122 123 71 40 1 118 55 20 177 15 51	Families can be complicated and beautiful at the same time.
51	117 178 22 30 167 47 176 72 53 21 51	Soccer is a very intense game.
51	117 118 177 136 46 137 36 90 107 211 51	Body builders need to ensure they have proper nutritional needs taken care of to stay in such shape.
51	11 60 170 203 131 7 126 201 89 48 51	His expression says a lot.
51	116 162 132 26 171 209 191 207 11 169 51	Eco tourism can be a boon for developing nations, but the long-term effects on the environment an outweigh short-term benefits.
51	52 180 1 40 50 203 60 104 29 19 51	Imagine how hard it was to build this perfectly 200 years ago!
51	209 214 159 125 127 2 17 179 150 18 51	Jumping high isn't about jumping far.
51	142 76 173 127 73 203 8 193 179 121 51	The harmonization between the banjo and the violin emulates that of an early Mozart piece.
51	120 113 173 151 147 22 25 161 212 199 51	What a strange decoration for a tree, not Christmassy at all.
51	52 107 170 145 167 151 53 38 117 88 51	I wonder what kind of trees are int he background? Why is the man hiding behind the rocks while the girl looks on unaware?
51	195 48 12 143 43 173 207 198 118 96 51	I swim among concrete a catfish among cracks
51	108 104 135 79 110 47 182 137 133 157 51	There's a lot of division in my neighborhood.
51	4 140 188 78 126 99 124 36 27 57 51	He seems to have an underlying fear of fun.
51	203 120 208 93 84 188 25 173 170 212 51	Nighttime in the city can be an confusing array of sights, sounds and emotions.
51	134 11 109 178 150 91 59 85 46 100 51	Wow, he barely took any damage from that fight.
51	42 23 34 214 65 123 87 191 8 147 51	I am so glad to see that he is standing good.  Hopefully if all of his development does right he will be walking on his own in no time.
51	126 207 107 155 13 215 143 209 14 104 51	Following this trail is like a maze.
51	166 169 123 188 194 66 154 29 158 7 51	I speculate that this tree was struck at around 4:15.
51	54 89 95 35 40 63 196 64 80 76 51	We are so excited, we can't wait!
51	11 133 89 28 110 114 30 26 148 208 51	Look at all the detail in the landscape.  Every stretch of grass has a purpose in our life.
51	78 29 211 113 106 56 191 149 5 81 51	This building has an extremely rich history within the local community.
51	41 206 45 24 146 118 131 128 80 142 51	What's going on here is a tailgating party for a nerd conference.
51	132 81 78 50 208 15 101 137 184 148 51	There is always something worth hearing when he takes the stage. Also, make a careful note of his body language.
51	39 64 163 21 47 73 160 180 106 215 51	I wonder which athlete autographed these pugilist boots.
51	147 166 131 46 31 204 136 163 198 186 51	You must practice a lot to compete in cycling.
51	211 1 56 76 210 21 146 188 81 96 51	This is where the greatest talks have been had.
51	211 7 210 166 169 100 81 15 131 99 51	If they each lift their left leg, while pushing forward on one another then the inertia started will be that of it raining cats and dogs on a tin roof. It's that serious!
51	153 82 63 189 55 175 75 42 102 85 51	The simplicity of this photo makes it most enjoyable to gaze at
51	16 197 188 167 26 83 80 125 185 214 51	The casting shadow from this bench is the star of this photo.
51	77 214 29 164 198 55 165 59 68 80 51	The dressing style is just too complicated.
51	77 138 179 112 94 183 65 24 150 152 51	There seems to be a great gathering of people yet not enough interaction.
51	214 179 119 204 108 85 122 126 170 24 51	my life is just great..
51	15 162 81 12 196 92 17 2 31 26 51	This picture represents exactly how I'm feeling this week.
51	27 60 153 23 211 186 59 31 36 11 51	Dont know what is the image about.
51	214 167 140 152 38 120 96 33 163 128 51	The amount of fine-tuned and precise mechanics behind the workings of an airplane require the most exact maintenance
51	187 90 36 204 99 188 114 67 154 35 51	The amount of detail captured here is incredible. From the tiny writings to the art work around him, I wish I could look around the room with a magnifying glass.
51	170 186 175 204 83 117 104 84 211 80 51	A young man decides his own future while those close to him celebrate the next step on the road of life.
51	33 67 94 80 202 12 22 188 180 27 51	This creature could be a fish, seahorse or a mollusk or some sort
51	88 100 102 82 28 32 94 209 3 76 51	If a youngster can play, I can play.
51	165 31 32 157 24 173 166 202 17 65 51	How do they know how big to make these stadiums??
51	55 56 101 49 176 90 212 206 43 177 51	Interesting composition and angle.
51	141 99 212 41 203 83 162 152 32 82 51	The geology of this area must be very interesting
51	88 64 37 112 27 78 166 157 3 124 51	I would love to know what that red cone is behind you.
51	175 105 8 115 80 142 165 44 172 195 51	Would this be considered Documentary style or a Landscape?
51	22 154 42 9 101 168 59 89 25 128 51	The art depicted in this photography is astonishing.
51	203 214 166 168 193 183 156 106 140 5 51	Love can bloom anywhere at any time
51	93 192 118 129 20 110 1 147 60 206 51	That is a lot of red on that vehicle.
51	73 105 11 67 27 25 31 210 172 140 51	Geopolitics would have you believe this is easy, but it took months of planning.
51	189 61 179 42 102 114 117 187 22 127 51	Is that the 286 AHY bullet train or the 794 TRS?

51	215 121 70 5 206 195 93 134 77 157 51	It is very unclear to me what must be so surprising to these two ladies, but clearly they see something others do not.  I'd venture to say it may be very interesting.
51	179 175 206 111 107 5 49 40 139 137 51	The details on her dress are actually hand made by her best friend and bridesmaid who specializes in dress making.
51	134 154 41 4 65 147 39 177 52 142 51	I really hate my owner, when am i getting fed again, why am i here?
51	210 36 67 81 150 75 204 1 42 134 51	So many dialogues could be occurring in this interaction. Seriously, the more you look at this, the more possibilities form.
51	100 22 41 146 157 72 102 11 62 106 51	Isn't this too much structure for a mere kids' playground structure?
51	6 2 137 118 54 35 193 140 86 133 51	The beautiful lines in the mushroom really capture the eye. Lovely photo.
51	124 23 127 169 145 199 81 125 163 204 51	The beach in general makes me feel warm and secure, but the clouds give me a sense of impending danger..
51	113 73 201 67 155 24 124 145 120 47 51	This loks like a color swatch I saw that scientists dubbed "the world's ugliest color."
51	14 120 146 169 41 125 46 170 158 115 51	The feelings of the yuletide season is drowned in commercialism.
51	96 161 115 207 140 185 22 154 89 156 51	It took many hours to make that tank.
51	58 182 193 203 185 164 133 105 63 43 51	Many greats have sung on this stage.
51	147 186 120 52 97 88 78 4 42 39 51	That's a really interesting costume/cosplay. I wonder which elements she is trying to share.
51	108 35 209 55 119 109 111 29 110 8 51	Animals are sometimes like family members
51	169 215 8 43 38 41 82 124 174 24 51	very often in life if you can find the right prospective you will see the whole scene will transform into a painting just waiting to meet canvas.
51	12 118 88 83 61 17 215 19 127 186 51	There's more than one band here. They have different uniforms.
51	142 114 128 198 7 113 22 124 183 176 51	So much going on, flags, bikes,  protest
51	181 165 33 137 110 152 79 168 177 131 51	Some days I want pepperoni, some days I want sausage, this signifies the ebbs and flows of my life.
51	73 140 28 164 78 19 40 79 205 3 51	This must have taken hours to hand paint.
51	196 54 17 71 175 111 195 47 141 26 51	Is a wall really a wall when there's an enormous entranceway in it?
51	100 206 152 50 155 201 116 126 122 55 51	The plethora of conversations in a convention hall lead to many like minded people meeting up for the first time and adds to an engaging environment like in this photo right here.
51	122 48 98 203 126 135 209 211 125 5 51	I think he is probably an intelligent human being.
51	24 100 158 197 126 96 191 3 165 144 51	Objects at rest stay at rest, objects in pictures will not move, regardless

51	208 5 90 71 135 156 149 145 201 209 51	I thought the player in blue had mermaid legs at first -- liike I used to.
51	191 161 176 152 11 102 107 32 34 172 51	That is a very difficult dance to perform.
51	142 112 108 202 119 181 149 68 139 207 51	This is a very detailed stage.

52	175 73 26 38 140 92 213 114 46 209 52	I would run through that alley in the dark and taunt that car to hit me.
52	198 97 65 68 160 195 109 171 18 79 52	I would fall down so quick on that.
52	215 214 67 18 150 159 49 42 187 195 52	Can we eat some food before we do this?
52	87 13 151 188 157 31 53 69 72 119 52	Why aren't these guys paying attention.
52	55 168 91 43 14 86 149 40 73 49 52	I wonder if this is paint with creyons or...
52	85 215 94 67 7 154 183 208 21 37 52	I bet I could do well on that mike
52	55 202 98 186 30 142 174 199 51 43 52	he looks so damn to be the only one kneeling on the floor.
52	193 201 5 199 15 192 87 175 57 54 52	Did she write all those books? That would've taken  a lot of time.
52	174 16 49 153 214 202 141 199 64 95 52	Does anyone really eat this much?
52	131 172 7 99 34 98 49 182 47 94 52	I bet i could get in that car
52	159 214 151 207 38 110 80 93 59 182 52	Run horse, run!

52	198 139 168 138 176 111 10 144 142 150 52	I would like to paint the whole room again.
52	88 137 6 39 56 41 114 149 115 168 52	I'd punch him in his face and take his pen from his pocket!
52	92 9 99 180 22 110 178 145 202 102 52	Looking very rusty and still in use.
52	167 86 151 132 206 104 87 49 174 101 52	Is he playing a sport, or does he just dress like that?
52	31 38 36 154 99 22 26 62 67 15 52	this building must be square that has four corners
52	205 174 28 109 77 194 166 203 213 101 52	I feel like climbing to the top of the tan building and jumping.
52	49 140 75 186 198 85 56 76 43 184 52	Haha! Eurotart is just a gay happy tart! Everyone should choose original!

52	110 150 40 181 57 41 204 199 95 105 52	At this point in life, it would be dumb for me to own a dog like this.
52	117 34 77 54 133 154 37 72 94 166 52	Are they bowling? Those are tiny balls.
52	170 9 84 8 58 35 64 191 61 142 52	Is he a real life knight?
52	97 84 24 123 43 182 106 141 146 103 52	This color makes feel dumb.
52	144 8 60 157 131 180 69 140 126 73 52	I want to jump from that window.
52	202 119 86 168 90 143 16 62 9 23 52	I shall call the one on the left Tierra and the one on the right Nadie. Ta-da!
52	73 64 123 17 134 114 136 7 77 142 52	Maybe shouldn't be cutting a pineapple with a pocket knife, I mean, how clean is that knife and wood surface really/
52	129 81 46 194 62 64 147 93 61 3 52	Go big bullhorn man

52	115 49 44 122 37 27 132 40 203 98 52	I'm going to steal one of those crowns and be rich!
52	135 92 10 68 116 156 72 71 80 184 52	Why aren't there any doors on those buildings?
52	156 51 26 58 85 35 10 149 144 151 52	What kind of drumset is that?
52	53 18 121 183 129 35 186 37 158 8 52	Is that really his mother?
52	48 116 114 12 141 70 150 215 16 88 52	Football is a boring sport.

52	100 140 182 160 163 97 108 142 173 104 52	Who in their right mind would wear that?
52	35 82 152 31 56 200 53 159 34 37 52	He needs to be careful, what if that dragon is real and gets mad at him?
52	213 57 103 151 161 101 162 98 69 93 52	Why does the lady have two birthday cakes?
52	140 86 207 201 150 4 82 188 26 141 52	I can read that very well.
52	44 60 33 2 168 192 93 170 62 9 52	This will be eaten by me today.
52	172 87 85 55 43 45 171 198 37 41 52	What is she looking at?
52	179 19 82 68 168 193 186 26 20 214 52	He is channeling aliens.

52	108 56 156 103 49 172 63 12 35 213 52	Did she just win something?
52	45 57 189 21 115 170 87 206 38 161 52	All good and fun until you spill it all over your papers. What will you read now?
52	138 108 129 1 47 11 114 174 124 61 52	Is that made of marshmallow?
52	185 204 181 21 215 104 206 119 10 111 52	Gosh, I wonder what's behind that dark doorway... I think I'll check it out!

52	51 126 134 204 62 106 102 176 71 49 52	Is that a green shirt?
52	190 82 143 83 110 207 198 85 130 175 52	Let me soak my tent
52	110 204 136 130 202 31 94 46 164 96 52	How stupid can someone be to throw a rock through this
52	166 40 198 59 205 130 193 191 116 156 52	I can't tell which side they're on. Who's winning?
52	73 160 165 136 39 196 209 123 116 148 52	There is no favorite picture
52	60 111 137 179 141 184 209 43 8 68 52	I would love to try to balance on that gutter

52	156 143 86 60 155 192 30 170 200 94 52	A trip with whole joint family is a monkey idea sometimes!
52	53 199 41 100 48 108 202 121 21 91 52	This must be a monkey claw.
52	107 78 204 110 32 27 38 208 71 40 52	There is literally a man about to jump off that building.
52	210 193 152 77 146 185 114 83 173 56 52	Haha, I wouldn't need shoes to run cause I'm a REAL man!
52	70 186 168 80 50 6 159 22 2 163 52	a silly colour combination for a bus
52	54 39 28 162 144 40 21 110 125 26 52	Is that building on fire?
52	127 150 139 195 158 1 166 94 15 188 52	Is she golfing? Or cleaning a pool while well-dressed? I can't tell.
52	209 137 183 30 139 113 188 53 214 43 52	Even childcare is a real success
52	73 68 50 94 143 191 42 30 92 139 52	Christmas is a shame and presents delude the youth of this country!
52	69 51 192 172 211 92 147 152 41 122 52	That looks like one of those putt putt golf courses where you have to choose the right hole, but whatever you choose it's always the wrong one.
52	146 97 81 33 171 162 149 207 92 84 52	This guy's dog is soooo much smaller than him, hahaha
52	33 100 78 9 55 42 179 213 177 4 52	It won't do much good for anywhere if it's still in the package.
52	201 120 183 21 175 130 177 1 196 140 52	I wonder hoe many fishes this dog be able to catch
52	97 177 5 50 56 192 184 123 108 104 52	I hope that tree doesn't fall on me.

52	149 54 20 21 131 15 16 185 79 188 52	At last, winning is sweet when everyone have thought otherwise previously
52	36 162 28 111 186 41 133 49 30 128 52	While Jack and Dana were posing for the picture, they neglected to keep an eye on their grill which had started a fire that would eventually burn the restaurant to the ground. The photo shoot promoting their new dish proved pointless.
52	142 194 102 173 200 68 190 54 172 51 52	He does not have a permit to do this
52	171 30 200 109 118 123 69 138 78 146 52	If I can see the edge of the horizon that means the world is flat.
52	114 182 181 19 212 169 32 147 65 204 52	they painted on a rock outside, if it rain it will go away

52	143 10 31 159 208 137 86 170 56 136 52	This menu is such a good magic spell list at the same time. I'm confident that with this I can raise an army to take over the world
52	4 153 161 75 148 83 23 147 92 181 52	The Ocean isn't that deep. In some places you can walk from America to Africa.
52	75 73 169 138 90 180 12 215 192 109 52	Are those stairs?
52	156 100 157 39 18 189 50 36 71 149 52	I bet they had to use a lot of paint to get those colors up there like that.
52	111 86 9 144 83 135 77 32 23 172 52	I'd jump off the roof of that into the pool lol

52	46 101 215 209 157 196 190 24 205 137 52	If I were in that cockpit I would press all the buttons! I don't care what they do!

53	101 137 122 23 105 76 192 55 31 209 53	Is that an ocean or a sea?
53	71 47 76 30 42 79 93 22 166 90 53	That plant looks like a crumpled up paper towel!
53	138 168 190 83 110 21 55 120 111 100 53	Red is a color comedians might wear.
53	132 19 202 25 91 107 13 8 105 16 53	mmmmm food! I'm getting hungry just looking at that lady make sandwiches

53	142 57 51 195 85 123 80 153 177 206 53	Someone was cleaning I presume?
53	123 145 197 51 213 202 70 84 26 214 53	is it possible to rock climb here?
53	48 188 164 123 86 114 24 202 113 103 53	This would make a great nursery,.

53	29 146 65 113 39 103 209 48 117 101 53	Modern jousting has lost some of it's regal flair.
53	177 64 10 85 9 83 128 34 72 163 53	God is good!
53	166 38 109 149 164 115 209 187 181 196 53	It is silly to wrap a  baby's gift
53	77 80 164 34 87 159 183 25 140 28 53	It would be foolish to climb those rocks

53	12 191 214 106 8 100 25 120 97 93 53	Who posted something silly like that?
53	187 134 47 208 126 150 92 56 75 138 53	Pointy plants! Pointy plants! The world needs more pointy plants!

53	89 64 150 95 68 143 190 142 192 138 53	Knock knock. Who's there?
53	128 75 93 175 86 105 79 164 149 198 53	Now you see me, now you don't.

53	166 32 69 119 65 76 29 215 107 10 53	Maybe I should just look at pictures instead of visiting these locations
53	186 149 120 82 127 32 52 99 154 97 53	Those are some serious knocked knees.
53	58 147 159 178 48 80 32 197 73 50 53	The flowers make parallel lines, how cute!
53	179 201 143 2 157 182 85 168 110 152 53	Cars shouldn't park so close to the door.
53	198 121 89 112 18 63 153 20 174 193 53	I would enjoy a nice surf session in those waves.
53	189 129 31 119 182 150 12 98 61 44 53	Laugh out loud her eyes are red and she is wearing a crown. She Devil?

53	14 20 142 145 161 44 29 96 183 79 53	Fooseball is my favorite sport. But that player in front of the net is a troublemaker. I think he's playing for the other team sometimes.
53	132 166 18 134 206 95 73 65 96 215 53	Is this image photoshopped? Those mountains can't be in the same place.
53	198 66 95 203 136 187 40 144 130 51 53	Can someone explain the purpose of all the arches?
53	194 80 56 8 205 49 177 213 78 13 53	yippee that path looks fun to skip along
53	56 206 75 126 154 3 209 90 1 117 53	That woman thinks the baby smalls nice.
53	183 42 211 43 103 29 110 90 134 68 53	It would be so cool to be able to count the little fireworks.
53	21 58 60 28 157 2 77 121 180 74 53	2*? I want a 3* quiche!
53	159 128 102 111 138 198 88 137 108 213 53	My skin after being in the sun for 4 minutes.

53	94 30 121 50 150 101 195 188 129 193 53	Looks like he's having 'Nam flashbacks. ;)
53	179 164 38 87 24 85 208 28 100 198 53	Where is everyone?
53	1 61 191 66 26 19 69 55 21 136 53	Pen drawings are pretty dumb.
53	19 189 107 72 43 187 82 112 13 57 53	The blocks are like a cake
53	141 94 99 68 5 43 73 205 209 138 53	If they crash, I'll eat my foot.
53	191 192 177 70 149 27 49 12 207 126 53	is this blue?
53	143 208 129 120 118 149 93 197 188 20 53	Looks like a fun place to be drunk at!
53	197 116 33 72 160 181 179 176 77 18 53	Don't take too many steps backwards!
53	122 195 199 104 189 84 164 71 111 159 53	Open wide while I stick a lollipop in your mouth.
53	142 7 160 125 56 127 140 134 129 191 53	Jesus and Moses sat together on a frothy white cloud full of babies and waited for a dove to land on their shoulder.
53	131 14 70 206 158 154 179 104 137 3 53	grass, earth, sun
53	74 37 34 58 60 158 165 109 195 82 53	I am about to jump out on the stage and sing "Danny Boy"!
53	207 174 173 163 17 107 96 30 94 14 53	Pink is so funny!
53	8 169 134 88 102 121 83 178 170 55 53	Hello, madam. Could I interest you in a party hat? Or perhaps a snow cone?
53	190 3 133 143 186 35 61 195 109 81 53	I want to play tag here.
53	124 119 88 112 72 192 8 22 120 46 53	I wonder if Old McDonald  lives there.
53	120 154 71 207 162 164 13 79 185 12 53	What a goofy dress. I bet kids love to play with it
53	38 182 55 5 151 155 77 116 192 108 53	A lovely day to frollick about.
53	151 107 125 145 26 5 98 72 51 61 53	I'd like to run into that water and splash around
53	10 17 200 173 47 161 127 98 32 72 53	Man he let his head get big.
53	118 191 66 102 153 130 107 210 119 21 53	Let's climb to the top and jump off.
53	75 152 124 41 131 140 202 97 127 148 53	That guy with the moustache looks more like my dad than a skateboarder.
53	152 121 177 176 157 49 98 86 48 68 53	This photo needs a clown with a cigarette looking out that right window! Lol.
53	161 163 94 81 8 197 210 34 97 41 53	Marijuana sure looks different now
53	31 184 52 196 3 190 198 35 153 129 53	The club looks like such a great time.  Just look at all those people!
53	63 22 30 32 75 185 157 16 115 162 53	Really funny hair.  I love the act.
53	9 59 30 122 83 138 46 196 180 34 53	The road is wet enough to slide across by foot.
53	52 71 24 111 209 79 152 110 200 163 53	What goofy looking curtains.  They don't even block any light.
53	16 115 149 118 107 33 145 23 117 98 53	15 for the speed limit is lame!
53	206 136 140 84 181 183 10 47 170 11 53	Bird, bird, bird of the sky, watch out for that cloud!
53	35 188 15 56 77 141 45 66 6 214 53	I can't see what's behind a finger you goof
53	164 208 49 26 143 146 117 129 102 147 53	Ha this baby's clothing is way too loose! He might grow into it by the time he's in kindergarten.
53	116 26 177 101 16 157 8 117 23 155 53	I wonder how many starfish I could eat
53	88 7 145 100 85 157 71 37 205 84 53	Come on why do we have to do this again? I have plenty of this to last a lifetime.
53	146 5 75 85 87 19 193 121 12 171 53	I love purple and yellow together!
53	109 111 215 207 125 35 119 98 46 56 53	Water is wet.
53	36 133 134 14 24 1 167 198 100 188 53	These look like some yummy pudding cups and treats for some late night snackin and playing video games lol
53	186 165 113 40 212 111 151 14 60 98 53	Ohh my goodness I can't choose.  I'll just take it all.
53	98 39 107 164 97 33 125 16 134 137 53	I love to get a sled and ride down that hill.  It looks like such a great time.
53	198 161 5 108 48 196 214 138 126 169 53	Betcha you cannot swing from the bars of this structure.
53	173 34 130 163 70 44 49 135 30 124 53	Looks like pea soup my man
53	213 212 182 9 161 99 62 172 154 190 53	I paid a lot for this
53	163 10 86 7 190 140 23 60 31 192 53	Kitens they are Purrrrrrrrrrrrrfect !!!!
53	130 93 69 164 50 43 143 49 21 20 53	The best part in this game is the senseless fights and powerful play!
53	123 115 31 93 138 99 144 125 213 162 53	This store does not intrigue me at all. So congested.
53	213 32 215 55 162 151 65 40 191 92 53	This train would be perfect to go around my Christmas tree!
53	39 19 33 151 198 95 60 205 77 20 53	Obviously the hat is the star of this show.
53	170 7 17 55 73 92 30 108 148 119 53	I can't eat at a table with plants... real or fake. They creep me out.
53	97 125 182 173 134 73 19 209 122 15 53	A goblin could fly in this hole.
53	28 24 185 154 20 40 167 215 82 6 53	I wonder what else eats out of this?
53	102 150 100 195 30 5 68 56 165 135 53	I wonder if an uncut pizza would make a good frisbee!
53	150 132 85 6 12 72 121 1 4 172 53	What a dirty house, plants are already growing in the middle of it.
53	45 73 1 114 123 127 25 91 161 80 53	Somebody needs to hire a maid ASAP!
53	6 21 38 152 59 211 192 123 19 168 53	What fun this looks.
53	86 120 39 17 136 3 176 25 10 108 53	I do not understand
53	109 148 83 48 209 90 7 112 52 2 53	theses always remind me of rude shapes. anyone else? lol
53	103 213 121 115 39 155 87 113 173 62 53	Metal on metal is rock'in.
53	146 1 55 35 214 59 120 36 17 29 53	I would hang off of this thing like a monkey.
53	177 169 70 147 146 181 69 102 115 174 53	These trips of relaxation are a must.
53	55 104 194 201 25 29 20 90 138 162 53	This looks like a large, chess set.
53	27 120 131 196 65 25 122 66 197 167 53	It sure is dark in there.
53	161 22 117 124 65 214 163 110 119 185 53	Skipping along town without a care in the world.
53	98 19 131 88 101 46 142 201 83 77 53	Is the guy slaying a dragon or petting it :D
53	179 88 129 4 171 5 149 140 197 11 53	Time to go to the rolly rink!!
53	96 197 138 140 55 109 204 191 50 156 53	Is this a nice painting or a bad picture ?
53	110 92 56 43 188 84 95 190 192 99 53	One two three red umbrellas, one white, whoopty-doo!
53	82 48 165 178 90 209 24 110 8 141 53	Wow, that looks like some good tasting bird feed.
53	7 194 125 132 56 79 105 121 47 89 53	Let the vine grow
53	122 209 40 84 135 167 88 212 11 82 53	Am I invited to dinner?
53	123 200 105 145 9 113 204 56 10 13 53	What a long, thin car!
53	183 22 155 210 150 166 41 149 99 159 53	I bet there's some fish wishing they were up on that boat
53	74 108 209 36 89 13 8 143 67 147 53	The light on the wall could be an intelligence receiver transmitter system used by the CIA.
53	64 54 18 184 99 177 32 81 144 47 53	Jazz! Wait, blues? Hmm, anyway, some kind of music!
53	88 68 195 70 42 150 169 170 6 139 53	She's going to win this.
53	195 49 184 50 76 39 205 87 48 155 53	What kind of color is that?
53	177 104 150 64 19 7 2 92 147 201 53	This guy is going to make me dizzy with those eyes! lol
53	4 195 29 191 74 215 31 161 157 181 53	We should put our heads in their to see what they smell like.
53	96 25 67 47 187 198 145 33 11 210 53	Let's lick them all
53	6 162 94 80 83 210 119 172 59 54 53	Is this a flip phone camera?
53	142 19 88 143 210 167 172 133 33 134 53	Let's spend every night at shows like this
53	124 48 168 125 59 25 97 212 161 195 53	Look!  It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a triangle!
53	190 128 85 84 69 58 78 142 46 43 53	I like to run through water like this splish-splashing around as much as I can!
53	162 124 145 152 147 129 24 166 88 107 53	These guys are crazy climbing this hill.
53	210 60 75 79 113 85 55 130 164 203 53	This is a great place to play Simon says
53	86 77 103 56 144 120 79 197 133 181 53	He seems elated to finally arrive at his intended destintation
53	189 9 198 10 135 112 88 169 49 32 53	There is a tile in here which tells us where Waldo really is.
53	187 122 140 174 81 18 102 68 199 33 53	Those mountains look like they are gonna blow UP!
53	82 183 121 149 131 153 105 116 161 119 53	I would throw on my Karate uniform and challenge them to a duel, just because I can!
53	38 211 131 109 207 201 74 8 96 67 53	I always love to buy new t-shirts for my child's sports team like in this picture...I have new shirts made for every game.
53	196 158 100 20 194 166 55 32 215 93 53	Bent knees dancing
53	69 8 172 165 83 151 124 3 180 107 53	Jump off the roof into the pool
53	49 194 208 11 6 113 112 204 98 10 53	Look at her in the background there, giving him that little smirk over the shoulder. How ridiculous.
53	186 166 140 141 201 1 99 148 170 67 53	Why all the light?
53	116 200 211 199 186 61 127 131 104 35 53	It's a ball!
53	38 172 126 72 145 194 158 203 33 151 53	I am going to buy three of these pay phone booths.
54	186 46 193 175 196 78 67 59 166 42 54	He's about to do a little dance. I have seen him move.
54	189 103 210 27 84 97 55 18 81 123 54	I don't know, I think maybe it would be better if we just took photos with our mind.
54	207 132 151 81 215 104 180 189 166 148 54	Really cool picture!!!
54	174 16 113 90 154 8 96 87 21 172 54	Gadgets make me smile
54	76 63 14 128 177 19 146 107 86 185 54	i hate it there. Too hot.
54	31 186 81 96 199 159 187 202 17 136 54	I think everyone should wear a printed vest.
54	104 52 188 182 74 183 138 78 4 209 54	This is a very strange bullet holder.
54	4 49 176 127 143 183 45 113 82 68 54	It is weird to see the signature
54	85 13 61 108 176 101 109 151 19 63 54	Dateline: Freenen, Ohio 3 pm July 4th. I'm undercover as a bag of wood and so far no one has noticed.
54	214 1 86 11 156 159 6 135 158 7 54	I could purchase all of this buy selling them my left foot.
54	33 119 32 28 185 59 141 163 155 83 54	I have my credit card, and I am going buy every single knickknack from the gift-store.
54	181 141 116 83 162 23 167 189 129 105 54	Although it does not often snow here, when it does I like to keep some of the iceballs like this in my freezer for later.
54	35 134 75 164 194 48 207 73 53 82 54	There, a bird on the tree, life and all.
54	95 162 4 114 6 3 5 61 182 91 54	I love looking at clouds.  I spent most of my waking hours observing the sky.
54	174 136 148 162 56 110 13 112 9 178 54	Her shirt would make a good napkin.
54	41 23 29 121 154 182 11 74 206 20 54	This looks really boring,
54	106 197 17 136 3 82 21 140 181 154 54	This is all wrong, no wonder why its empty.
54	205 64 52 4 23 39 2 35 77 156 54	Looks like Big foot was here! Better call the news!
54	172 162 148 95 153 170 199 77 11 179 54	That looks like quite the toilet clog.
54	20 162 187 29 78 137 175 30 55 8 54	Can these tanks still shoot at people?
54	5 200 186 215 28 155 160 140 166 87 54	This baby is not interested in what you're saying.
54	174 170 84 47 146 199 34 37 128 177 54	It is weird to buy in bulk
54	120 26 161 5 172 56 95 3 20 154 54	Is he singing or praying?
54	162 119 39 205 140 161 120 102 35 103 54	The sun is very odd
54	201 48 85 199 211 169 71 146 86 55 54	I wish I could eat that orange hate
54	70 211 207 194 183 4 128 75 2 12 54	I don't even want to know what happens next.
54	154 193 65 141 89 34 158 127 100 71 54	Can we go swimming here?
54	203 139 142 134 205 215 191 44 186 173 54	What a beautiful mask, i'd wear it.
54	110 191 82 174 95 169 111 132 204 188 54	A good cite seeing
54	2 135 34 1 13 184 210 117 168 104 54	Some kind of route
54	70 74 180 207 113 162 201 79 67 202 54	The tree is magical
54	190 167 84 30 156 1 123 191 124 212 54	Are you showing me something or?
54	178 98 176 199 163 174 80 28 147 106 54	The shadow of the tree branches on the pavement is like a road map.
54	86 116 32 99 105 96 80 195 45 90 54	Why aren't they in a classroom?
54	77 146 48 25 122 177 43 53 193 183 54	They'd play better if they carried umbrellas.
54	31 134 101 138 22 208 147 155 146 126 54	That tree is off
54	91 174 114 208 80 213 75 9 134 16 54	My brother, my man
54	40 38 6 139 171 110 149 145 120 91 54	Looming, Long, Busy
54	190 98 183 130 194 169 157 12 7 207 54	hmmm. what is she doing?
54	205 124 157 91 189 149 53 110 60 173 54	Gazing at the city below, I can see everything yet I see nothing.
54	141 170 71 82 101 213 16 178 22 66 54	Maybe they are going to a funeral.
54	146 147 199 19 110 121 88 96 130 49 54	The crane is working hard on the planet Mars.
54	152 214 44 92 27 162 105 138 79 172 54	Will the boat capsize with that amount of people?
54	89 123 213 174 197 207 152 45 126 162 54	There are posts for a fence but no fence...
54	78 133 4 3 152 81 101 144 64 134 54	This picture excites me...
54	80 6 46 58 37 197 171 134 166 32 54	Karaoke gone wrong I think.
54	24 83 199 161 213 32 29 48 188 155 54	Seagulls taste good
54	155 7 158 42 142 207 173 94 21 95 54	I wish I could walk on that water.
54	159 125 109 87 144 119 108 84 167 95 54	This is how I always see the world.
54	170 117 147 165 140 91 84 51 131 85 54	Picnic at the house.
54	17 134 197 155 92 166 206 3 199 118 54	This looks like my death certificate.
54	63 172 51 96 4 110 203 118 26 165 54	I wonder what will happen here
54	40 196 203 61 142 68 204 209 63 62 54	This is the strangest brownie I've ever seen.
54	205 175 166 137 165 116 155 103 7 36 54	There is a ghost in the corner.
54	202 155 76 191 31 102 204 2 64 11 54	At first, that looked a bit like tombstones.
54	104 60 175 147 22 70 182 189 13 198 54	it is very much weird to sleep with animals in bed
54	163 105 102 19 137 1 9 174 128 22 54	how many paintings are in the bathroom
54	32 167 47 147 50 192 68 102 213 195 54	Is this a forest or an ocean, i think its an ocean.
54	50 8 51 118 171 19 127 93 173 23 54	What are these people doing?
54	165 109 156 62 127 129 41 137 28 192 54	I think the windmill looks like a weird cross.
54	194 76 187 50 175 26 134 90 55 42 54	it has every large parking area
54	57 157 58 86 94 207 192 91 80 110 54	i feel too bad my net speed falls
54	120 51 132 40 133 199 153 164 127 196 54	Like a rock!
54	122 130 196 76 94 70 192 148 99 210 54	Why are the windows so tall?
54	196 192 201 155 195 171 44 197 158 157 54	when I go outside I love when it rains
54	15 158 137 17 151 112 80 160 50 44 54	The condensation reminds of warm summer days in Alaska.
54	110 150 105 8 191 136 137 55 119 50 54	This looks like a squid to me.
54	202 176 172 208 4 55 195 49 81 115 54	You can tell this conversation isn't forced, not!
54	170 184 94 24 139 62 115 69 97 7 54	If I were a koala my name would be Dan.
54	134 58 64 97 137 123 150 94 181 169 54	Love the green lights
54	127 52 113 67 105 13 30 171 166 46 54	WOWZA, what a great angle!!!
54	213 214 95 140 97 180 34 191 126 158 54	I could make a great salad out of this.
54	17 26 184 52 104 85 139 27 66 208 54	The window looks like it is vomiting the vines
54	1 22 203 100 79 160 66 196 84 60 54	Periwinkle but not quite. A New-agey color.
54	26 32 211 156 182 105 197 149 115 110 54	The people in this car look like munchkins. They're so squished in!
54	96 197 7 204 140 128 31 69 154 105 54	This must be somewhere else?
54	84 85 167 3 5 61 114 38 119 169 54	What a nice door, is it from ikea?
54	49 140 68 159 115 102 155 154 25 120 54	Hey there! can i be your friends
54	101 118 63 148 62 84 102 51 180 23 54	Bird is alone searching for good partner
54	197 90 14 89 202 19 32 95 163 34 54	c00t, h!t m3 up l0l
54	202 194 180 149 5 181 64 116 1 193 54	eyyyyyy h!t m3 up lmfaooooooooo
54	70 213 90 141 102 18 120 40 15 106 54	That fish is staring at me!
54	78 205 191 133 147 148 60 188 40 68 54	Why are there only 4 windows? Should be 4.5
54	45 180 65 166 194 210 8 26 152 101 54	I think if you lean to far on that it would break!
54	26 56 67 197 49 174 46 202 17 32 54	A weird looking view of nature.
54	25 185 193 119 91 175 67 76 141 114 54	The yellow leaves of the tree just seem strange to me.
54	149 27 86 181 14 211 169 157 82 8 54	Field hockey is like hockey, but in a field of grass.
54	163 57 81 96 162 32 184 35 142 23 54	tattooing via morse code
54	186 80 215 95 151 12 13 61 64 120 54	Does this qualify as a traffic jam?
54	202 160 53 52 49 26 78 107 76 119 54	Green is a good color for me, though I don't see that people like green much.
54	118 47 148 188 117 44 68 144 163 141 54	This looks particularly strange.
54	55 71 111 96 201 4 62 99 61 112 54	Why is the sun setting in the North instead of the West today?
54	178 121 111 120 150 125 143 110 116 88 54	It's good to see such patriotic little people.
54	88 191 114 30 163 57 8 179 55 213 54	This band is an evil influence.
54	207 112 5 138 214 18 26 88 82 3 54	They are driving me to insanity!
54	42 130 8 200 140 158 72 13 114 214 54	This is a secret ufo!
54	108 166 142 180 197 204 32 25 159 78 54	I could paint my child this colour
54	10 79 35 42 93 2 32 69 145 160 54	This looks oddly satisfying
54	138 71 161 179 62 80 76 143 40 122 54	These flowers are crying.
54	181 89 186 192 69 133 27 20 132 137 54	I can't tell if this is 16 images of the same guy or not.
54	59 4 55 130 64 194 136 60 90 7 54	we are the three best friends that any one ever had...
54	159 125 166 124 39 177 116 15 92 173 54	What an odd animal that is, it almost blends into the background.
54	192 76 69 126 103 9 201 203 101 31 54	This a weird little old thing what do you call, a boat? Running through all the fish beds that rascal.
54	200 11 127 171 197 21 142 78 203 174 54	Why is there a line across the road?
54	207 80 43 152 200 42 20 3 168 193 54	duuuuude thats legit skill bwo
54	130 58 75 26 94 49 145 123 181 138 54	I wonder if there are any archaeologists in there battling snakes.
54	3 76 192 146 132 66 105 98 73 125 54	I wonder if she will sing this song that I like.
54	125 172 22 107 83 12 14 203 58 192 54	That gate couldn't keep a shark out.
54	109 164 80 72 122 199 202 133 2 206 54	I pecked this out all by my self.
54	116 153 202 77 75 59 43 106 103 33 54	Is that an oval or a circle.
54	130 189 70 199 163 119 129 215 53 17 54	That motorcycle has a mind of it's own.
54	96 125 120 45 147 144 170 163 135 60 54	I do not like the stripes on his shirt - they remind me of a flag.
54	146 84 39 6 96 32 192 93 127 147 54	This picture is not very pretty at all. It looks kind of like white lines painted a gray canvas.
54	12 109 80 58 79 50 41 214 184 6 54	is that child eating that toy?
54	158 126 89 55 33 203 97 117 215 24 54	I wonder why there are two images on the window.  Can't they all be the same.
54	138 126 195 171 185 20 117 128 49 129 54	Was the bear working on his car?  Looks like he still has oil on him.
54	55 57 1 144 104 65 77 44 119 115 54	Is it me or are the rocks cut into cubes and scattered in a particular pattern.
54	84 174 29 202 159 192 12 48 22 114 54	I could just lay in the street.
54	101 99 183 16 118 148 151 135 161 66 54	Blue makes me nauseous.
54	35 122 173 195 38 212 143 189 168 133 54	That is the batmobile!
54	72 24 58 143 91 121 22 77 134 57 54	He looks like hed be just hopping around, hopping around...
54	147 176 138 106 197 120 5 117 132 55 54	That is my mommy.
54	210 158 19 135 65 92 98 129 5 197 54	Those weeds remind me of spaghetti.
54	69 195 214 130 39 176 167 111 185 146 54	Is that a man or a woman?
54	13 55 88 162 99 48 131 159 122 22 54	I wonder if he wasn't in the library would the light be on.
54	187 77 7 37 154 32 171 22 5 74 54	This looks like a hole that an inter-dimensional being would appear out of.
54	123 213 117 166 175 209 22 51 86 96 54	The bird seeks its prey...
54	109 91 5 132 214 81 106 76 157 105 54	the leprechauns have taken me lucky charms.
54	31 93 55 176 150 61 33 2 78 196 54	Isn't that strange
54	28 84 159 34 153 59 163 103 126 120 54	Large evergreen trees
54	22 180 57 21 102 11 1 142 163 64 54	That butterfly should be as colorful as the flower.
54	130 144 97 128 21 30 197 82 9 175 54	The shadow walker shifts from spot to spot among the stone walls.
54	129 22 123 177 197 75 61 36 175 214 54	The combination of glasses and skullcap make me question his fashion choice
54	80 79 110 85 39 137 36 135 140 42 54	The men mirrored each other as they walked by.
54	191 136 195 44 57 106 70 159 182 131 54	Those beams of light are really jarring, I don't know if I could stand to be out there with them.
54	119 156 158 27 204 39 101 57 77 130 54	Why does this entrance have so many signs that are covered with plants?
54	7 203 78 38 139 166 154 86 2 124 54	This rock looks just like the lump on my head.
54	170 173 142 80 212 154 3 214 18 4 54	who let this child oder at arestaurant alone?
54	50 60 138 198 179 168 153 146 123 122 54	I wonder why some of the land is flat but not others?
54	105 20 168 71 102 183 186 93 82 150 54	Why are so many people walking on the road?
54	45 170 188 57 126 89 61 138 40 186 54	Wait... two teams but they're wearing three different colored outfits?
54	10 155 148 104 176 112 14 207 159 85 54	I just love this backstage view of the sound table.
54	200 178 77 9 172 152 28 11 47 181 54	I wonder if this card would make a good throwing star.
54	50 40 186 14 159 73 71 144 126 187 54	The man in back is like, "Gonna eat this kid's brain!"
54	112 46 126 127 51 130 23 18 166 81 54	He is playing an evil song to manipulate.
54	39 212 174 151 199 156 69 140 146 6 54	This is a evil thinking creature.
54	167 110 105 26 21 137 130 153 29 4 54	I wonder if they really had her.  Could they all really like here that much.
54	6 38 71 152 44 128 169 132 84 122 54	The chef is my father.
54	186 99 6 137 210 74 9 39 76 84 54	I don't know about you, but I'd take the survivor route!
54	156 18 149 129 98 10 140 134 33 171 54	Wow, what an original shot; looks a bit surreal.
54	88 95 192 99 42 187 66 114 164 76 54	Its very curiois how all these crows are next to all of the pots, pans, and plates
54	148 62 70 121 106 198 69 186 37 165 54	That dog looks kinda dopey.
54	134 35 156 154 102 32 57 85 61 20 54	The car is not moving
54	175 204 14 8 170 189 68 60 66 75 54	Why is her skin so red
54	191 97 43 199 142 41 91 71 164 180 54	Strange night lighting.
54	197 155 90 29 126 52 117 113 1 144 54	she is standing for a picture between 2 random pilers
54	193 60 29 128 28 66 75 57 145 118 54	That looks like an old village
54	87 131 113 164 128 115 204 86 37 178 54	The clouds look like angry spirits bent on destroying the town.
54	172 183 89 102 151 37 132 4 121 135 54	Those people on the left are tilted.
54	11 37 71 187 185 62 213 150 1 122 54	That baby looks weird anyhoo.
54	175 151 45 140 85 17 186 146 5 48 54	I have one of those, at home in my basement.
54	101 167 154 126 178 24 103 84 151 152 54	I do not like the red tones here- they make me uncomfortable.
54	20 208 155 209 61 174 132 13 77 107 54	Who knows what this is, but I like it!
54	145 156 29 99 98 2 212 28 107 96 54	Looks like rotting poo in a colon picture.
54	2 118 85 23 66 55 69 75 113 128 54	I'm just walking down the street with the banana shoes.
54	215 126 115 138 197 1 15 30 69 165 54	Think I could jump from dome to dome?
54	153 205 86 109 28 80 105 36 162 20 54	The landslide only affected the other side of the road.
54	163 64 165 44 189 178 85 101 103 108 54	Let's run to support whatever we choose.
54	81 123 95 106 138 198 69 46 75 78 54	Rock on dude!
54	118 94 34 109 3 145 85 180 92 24 54	The bird is thinking that it has landed in a nest of aliens turned to stone by time and cruelty.
54	150 156 127 212 32 149 170 105 27 9 54	I wear bright patterns like that girl's and hang upside down from the rafters in my garage.
54	12 176 182 210 100 109 93 94 195 46 54	I wanna eat the vines
54	166 17 43 133 18 209 168 132 92 145 54	Men with glasses remind me of smart janitors
54	89 90 27 26 162 21 123 67 46 179 54	So I am guess the lady with the bag wants to give him donuts to throw on the field.
54	132 99 151 199 42 119 86 43 107 213 54	I'm not familiar with this form of interpretive dance.
54	156 140 137 63 108 5 172 90 181 11 54	I wonder if he's looking to see if a secret agent is following him
54	212 18 61 201 149 168 207 195 102 81 54	I wonder if the flower can communicate with the radio?
54	18 98 59 41 17 190 24 195 8 125 54	She is uniquely beautiful.
54	120 126 107 64 138 37 12 187 191 196 54	I'd like my friends to feed me someday
54	180 68 111 82 147 127 46 174 212 121 54	Is this a convention for blind people?
54	82 45 87 75 201 181 145 88 200 63 54	Well she has hair
54	176 97 135 57 3 55 30 117 25 204 54	I'm trying to get a flea here.
54	187 29 176 36 131 39 137 179 58 73 54	I could walk into this painting.
54	9 188 179 72 89 156 11 152 66 135 54	I want to do exactly this.
54	193 49 46 104 62 34 164 108 197 123 54	I think there are birds that live at the top.
54	167 12 38 190 120 121 17 73 107 211 54	Why is it snowing in summer?
55	211 76 15 77 104 140 49 122 50 17 55	That looks like two separate buildings even though it is really just one big building.
55	25 15 148 19 93 122 65 49 74 177 55	She seems happy that she got flowers. I wonder what the occasion is.
55	171 176 189 53 81 86 124 211 174 95 55	Men with beards and long hair are ok.
55	18 128 4 85 115 150 34 199 125 2 55	A receding hairline is best accepted.
55	109 203 124 174 177 7 122 173 104 108 55	Families have many dynamics, mine is just like everyone else's, different,
55	63 62 204 171 210 154 199 16 32 22 55	I feel no attachment at all to this place.
55	151 203 184 157 81 31 53 66 2 38 55	The sun sets somewhere and rises somewhere. Who is to judge time?
55	45 46 165 35 172 138 111 85 132 198 55	Once that snake hisses it's going to be not such a cute experience
55	109 129 97 158 91 52 184 156 40 138 55	That is unsafe.
55	156 64 80 168 116 46 6 68 131 18 55	Lightning is very dangerous, especially when you are outside.
55	208 76 145 46 53 22 158 179 69 211 55	This seems a cost-effective vehicle. An aging, but sturdy truck is a good choice to haul fire department gear.
55	9 80 197 203 45 2 70 202 144 211 55	Just another aspiring model trying to make it
55	95 1 70 83 26 142 68 65 115 137 55	that building looks objective
55	50 6 42 155 205 200 104 36 48 113 55	A skyline tonight.
55	149 84 207 38 147 2 174 138 105 21 55	What are they sitting infront of the car for? So strange.
55	22 165 62 133 73 28 75 85 156 89 55	I have many plants too
55	76 150 3 158 131 46 165 82 154 197 55	i dont understans what these couldes are doing together
55	4 76 82 35 72 193 120 173 83 156 55	I am separate from the group but treat everyone as an equal
55	128 152 84 101 158 3 130 92 37 196 55	A brick house.
55	111 132 94 68 120 100 118 69 180 184 55	Who is Mr. Fix it now?
55	26 89 96 14 210 9 204 171 3 181 55	I am impartial to the viw
55	215 206 10 83 34 39 128 7 60 119 55	A bunch of kids sitting down.
55	155 170 185 136 83 211 59 94 122 172 55	I have no connection to this history.
55	58 113 101 4 6 178 194 40 67 143 55	That looks like an okay neihgborhood.
55	198 97 189 37 57 115 193 138 124 43 55	disinterested, unjaundiced, ungrudging
55	164 16 71 101 108 62 139 14 195 46 55	That sculpture is interesting.
55	65 158 76 10 193 106 42 207 146 89 55	nothing to say
55	16 156 186 39 57 9 22 102 31 103 55	Some would say beautiful flowers, I say just flowers.
55	1 191 141 214 23 146 215 26 163 145 55	The lady had to be impartial to the crowd
55	23 103 169 28 72 73 121 159 67 134 55	The iguana can get hurt on that lamp, it is dangerous.
55	25 141 192 145 52 150 176 15 22 214 55	The man is impartial to the ideas
55	174 41 74 161 132 197 89 150 170 4 55	The camera angle is not ideal for viewing.
55	22 73 136 19 25 87 182 83 158 5 55	The stonework in this house is ok
55	19 197 174 46 50 25 63 152 95 159 55	This factory gave power to much of the downdown city in a time before now.
55	57 110 189 194 163 92 174 37 205 13 55	This woman is wearing a nice coat.
55	95 104 149 172 84 16 41 114 2 204 55	Sea turtles are old.
55	101 188 170 205 135 118 46 105 133 56 55	All of their outfits are matching.
55	60 138 24 180 166 109 185 54 188 40 55	She is really posing.
55	197 113 201 17 47 91 126 21 163 22 55	This city is warm.
55	80 121 41 207 24 38 108 62 173 152 55	This city is so boring.
55	10 124 78 159 8 203 113 85 96 204 55	This looks like a great place for bats to live.
55	171 106 31 144 169 175 11 199 36 67 55	There are a lot of people in this photo.
55	115 49 198 212 54 6 4 174 185 3 55	It looks like they're burning the mortgage or something like that.
55	76 201 31 152 107 91 123 113 178 161 55	They make a good couple.
55	196 176 189 179 30 154 212 37 164 215 55	Oh what dull sculptures.
55	20 38 205 37 42 25 163 204 63 165 55	Oh, those are tomatoes
55	50 164 176 163 168 195 180 108 186 193 55	What a neat shape for a building.
55	208 24 14 102 82 16 70 92 68 42 55	Here is a bookshelf.
55	200 52 91 78 28 135 101 22 4 191 55	more than sisters
55	88 173 130 127 9 95 109 161 54 186 55	They must be protesting and wasting time.
55	57 1 40 183 99 114 63 121 124 189 55	That panda is drawn in marker.
55	116 194 67 19 201 112 120 169 171 126 55	This town is rather dirty.
55	59 12 132 99 193 164 80 205 148 69 55	What a colorful insect.
55	103 156 173 132 47 36 59 48 88 130 55	That's something, I guess.
55	85 165 95 72 86 152 21 166 82 112 55	Eh, I've seen better rainbows before.
55	153 13 175 94 4 185 57 11 166 48 55	Its a light post
55	182 23 125 32 13 153 173 181 47 72 55	Horses are the most "meh" creatures in existence.
55	178 93 197 88 131 45 49 24 83 154 55	I guess some people do enjoy weddings. I guess others don't.
55	53 6 215 16 183 156 50 176 175 170 55	I guess beaches are for some folks.
55	16 80 37 51 72 182 136 30 1 205 55	It has tires.
55	121 61 199 30 51 200 208 25 81 62 55	He say with his aged barrels.
55	29 111 213 67 153 121 104 165 9 96 55	Random stones washed up like memories.
55	71 184 49 132 102 173 113 78 2 74 55	People always comment on skyline of the cathedral, but I think it's just normal.
55	168 42 195 113 166 20 124 153 199 188 55	It looks as if someone is moving.
55	210 38 137 76 98 143 188 36 58 205 55	Choosing a boat
55	45 63 177 153 168 161 118 72 86 100 55	Three men are leaning over a railing.
55	139 39 77 41 116 70 127 211 36 187 55	The box is silver his shirt is red
55	30 210 148 152 173 39 71 119 67 131 55	I doubt this guy is any funny.
55	199 146 148 190 98 35 50 7 19 46 55	Nice, water tower.
55	25 108 70 30 130 117 7 197 165 211 55	Some children like playing with bulldozers I guess.
55	152 18 32 110 159 30 2 36 128 87 55	Walking through the streets of this town like every other day.
55	198 83 215 133 40 159 5 184 191 60 55	That's a cat
55	58 214 20 201 119 145 148 110 212 181 55	It looks like a boring race.
55	198 60 139 47 98 2 214 109 118 35 55	Could have painted something that looked good.
55	54 63 139 123 198 15 129 69 191 109 55	The green leaves are gloating just below the water.
55	202 88 203 110 119 66 52 165 80 62 55	It looks like it could be tie dye, but I really don't care.
55	45 194 64 49 68 65 53 200 82 138 55	I'm not so sure about these animals
55	190 74 212 196 203 44 60 132 159 117 55	Pride parades are generally colorful events.
55	14 137 50 24 106 99 141 205 200 151 55	I think she is lost
55	147 202 57 61 179 195 69 14 215 5 55	The most boring party in the world.
55	152 7 169 184 149 191 58 60 105 181 55	That is bird is just there living.
55	87 84 109 60 74 201 71 137 196 45 55	We are free in this space.
55	104 160 165 60 16 136 170 204 98 155 55	I don't really care for the music they seem to play.
55	145 196 52 16 106 44 94 80 54 71 55	This is the third bay we visited on our trip last week.
55	103 177 15 178 181 126 102 149 77 128 55	This group of children appear to be about to start a race.
55	166 85 215 136 193 62 2 96 23 112 55	I don't think much of this color.
55	210 56 18 157 99 5 194 143 199 189 55	These birds are not important.
55	202 37 59 172 18 167 198 175 32 24 55	I don't care about what they are looking at.
55	86 156 1 188 212 140 54 7 173 138 55	I don't care much for sculpture art.

55	113 29 126 151 53 188 97 162 59 96 55	City life is very different from urban life,i like its vibrancy.
55	199 8 73 208 128 102 113 121 63 31 55	I kind of want to try it? But i kind of don't at the same time. It looks ok though.
55	59 29 13 102 202 169 90 26 35 83 55	Nature at its best.
55	80 43 99 173 59 27 104 15 19 164 55	I'm sure she is fine.

55	5 30 138 115 172 168 81 10 62 85 55	It's glowing, maybe it's at night?
55	117 2 85 38 28 200 25 133 98 144 55	This purple man is a bit sweaty.
55	84 56 204 36 179 77 42 66 145 194 55	This room is bright.
55	211 142 177 188 103 140 180 28 157 21 55	The tree is in the way.
55	112 54 207 86 101 113 69 148 52 203 55	These girls are only laughing to be polite.
55	77 4 51 125 70 207 215 76 59 20 55	Beverage on table.
55	60 7 51 99 91 66 68 63 210 140 55	This could be Anybar USA.
55	195 193 69 71 106 141 49 54 33 142 55	The red dude is giving the green dude a good run for his money.

55	86 150 68 120 40 88 99 211 157 140 55	That picture is stupid
55	77 115 142 10 172 200 98 103 100 191 55	Well, it could be painted and be a pretty work of art.
55	193 162 107 85 99 54 207 73 46 41 55	This are artist renderings of various podiums.
55	20 76 32 131 28 130 112 84 72 13 55	This has got to be the most useless thing I have seen today.
55	96 52 172 50 128 11 78 196 212 180 55	They look bored.
55	69 73 7 79 134 158 179 67 101 166 55	This look fun but dangerous. Not for me.
55	22 93 153 90 150 187 165 203 18 215 55	I'm not sure why he was stabbed.
55	72 212 184 202 182 214 193 57 199 29 55	That is has a light around it.
55	137 214 209 29 107 72 23 22 40 78 55	It's a grid.
55	84 177 186 157 176 201 19 194 152 198 55	I don't want to live in this city
55	106 134 189 64 196 100 206 9 203 211 55	The one on the right's facial expression makes me think they aren't having a good time.
55	175 113 53 147 36 94 132 73 160 116 55	Some grass, nothing special
55	90 156 76 180 149 177 86 186 179 100 55	I see 8 black yarns and 2 green
55	185 73 211 6 114 143 87 139 135 194 55	The leaf appears to be able to collect water rather easily.
55	63 96 41 112 44 19 204 93 103 140 55	That is a weird car.
55	41 142 84 168 178 130 91 192 190 143 55	This is a toilet room
55	103 20 153 91 19 181 99 57 203 36 55	What's with the green?
55	208 21 31 126 176 139 174 35 73 54 55	What is the world is a suffix.
55	28 200 149 202 67 196 150 11 82 48 55	I don't think a human face is like that.
55	83 187 24 188 111 129 28 4 156 95 55	I once caught maleria in the jungles of Vietnam.
55	90 160 49 195 74 149 169 78 50 72 55	Hands are for washing.
55	146 177 110 89 147 171 3 167 31 19 55	Looks like anime. I'm not into it
55	183 169 146 63 153 30 200 173 137 113 55	Someone needs to hire a landscaper.
55	105 58 158 120 5 15 188 29 27 157 55	Racing just isnt for me
55	91 7 21 98 51 152 144 27 17 10 55	You both have a point because on on end this can be an obstacle, and on the other, it can be an asset.
55	169 107 43 38 212 60 44 54 63 129 55	That sign looks like it could be old.
55	16 203 133 197 179 42 77 112 100 13 55	The street light is out of service.
55	75 3 144 102 87 203 188 163 196 155 55	It looks like he might have some kind of skin problem on his nose.
55	123 102 164 31 2 176 191 71 89 6 55	The boat looks cool, Is it hers? maybe
55	28 56 41 12 47 165 72 179 65 106 55	This swimmer's stroke style is totally inefficient.
55	114 42 51 213 135 148 138 184 92 133 55	It is not really the sky everyone.
55	206 146 135 91 9 159 194 8 86 118 55	This is a beautiful setting perhaps in a church.  THe architecture is stunning
55	173 77 150 39 183 89 118 148 198 178 55	Thailand is full of structures such as these with a curved roof.

55	150 24 38 213 174 7 16 110 177 48 55	That building looks pretty tall, but there's definitely taller buildings in the world.
55	81 64 153 184 8 208 197 60 211 212 55	That image has some grass in it.
55	139 168 137 6 19 58 145 43 107 15 55	A cat playing with the air.
55	131 27 118 188 45 36 39 176 200 193 55	It looks like there is a car parked behind that tree.
55	60 82 79 64 139 16 150 120 65 7 55	All I know is that they're talking.  What about, I couldn't tell ya.
55	117 106 115 107 33 172 157 132 81 134 55	This flower is okay, it could be a lot better though.
55	209 152 160 215 25 167 68 171 190 184 55	birds are boring.
55	81 186 71 98 177 48 212 51 78 92 55	I think they're stuffed animals. I don't care.
55	41 132 211 4 112 52 115 67 58 97 55	No idea what to drink and leave
55	31 40 127 174 18 215 34 99 7 86 55	There are more purple flowers than leaves in this picture.

55	175 34 208 81 107 154 67 99 112 167 55	I don't care for this color.
55	131 95 184 72 25 46 35 66 159 114 55	This is not a big deal at all.
55	139 158 66 121 17 98 205 14 111 127 55	What in the world is this!?
55	3 197 215 9 121 187 175 51 125 159 55	Read the additional warning sign in the bathroom, which also includes braille for reading.
55	88 104 78 149 48 157 195 115 81 154 55	The architectural preciseness of this building fascinates me
55	191 198 45 13 34 144 35 161 11 139 55	I really don't care if this building is historic or not.
55	107 34 185 20 4 65 175 49 151 126 55	Nice wedding, but I dont like the carpet
55	43 129 52 42 45 182 19 71 27 12 55	Beautiful building, if not the most practical.
55	36 199 149 213 108 131 28 101 142 7 55	art shows are so extravagant
55	86 195 26 164 135 22 81 121 32 77 55	I guess that's a decent play.
55	4 105 16 135 189 153 202 174 203 32 55	That looks like a sharp rock
55	110 158 7 74 37 71 56 205 215 10 55	Not sure if I like the trees
55	185 74 158 181 58 2 153 120 133 177 55	There are plants here.

57	19 211 148 14 151 212 117 95 6 81 57	artistic, sporty, athletic
57	53 135 132 6 16 27 177 194 101 13 57	He's never going to have a girlfriend.
57	21 12 45 4 17 142 165 172 8 88 57	Purple reminds me of raisins.  Raisins remind me of oatmeal cookies.  I hate oatmeal cookies!
57	138 55 31 205 11 139 67 113 54 35 57	That looks cold.
57	155 14 96 161 118 162 198 82 157 147 57	I would swim in this ocean and allow myself to drown.
57	190 1 152 136 138 144 29 87 137 97 57	His eye sight will probably die before he does.
57	190 33 191 11 115 123 19 31 124 104 57	nobody is smiling
57	46 99 74 147 203 115 113 163 156 1 57	Thats and uninventive pose
57	64 9 201 182 70 27 183 208 93 121 57	The wheels look like yellow cheese, poor color choice.
57	145 25 215 189 18 122 43 177 195 128 57	The looks like a creepy mannequin.
57	119 7 133 39 178 151 44 64 173 37 57	I don't have a good feeling about him as a leader.
57	19 73 194 126 101 175 114 20 208 161 57	This beer is likely to hurt someone.
57	83 35 185 156 44 46 37 76 8 40 57	What a great path to walking on..
57	85 53 112 176 11 109 96 9 75 181 57	Painting life as it flashed before your eyes.
57	200 8 98 69 33 134 99 179 151 53 57	Man our world is slowly being destroyed.
57	180 123 66 138 1 44 148 112 199 75 57	They won't get their autographs signed, nope.
57	139 111 116 124 70 121 26 129 88 20 57	Those glasses are too dull for her, for a funeral maybe.
57	42 166 175 119 120 170 106 61 67 151 57	She's going to get fired, not good work behavior.
57	49 82 31 74 7 61 138 108 89 96 57	She needs to get off her phone, or she will lose her job.
57	79 125 123 46 92 194 48 23 113 58 57	That woman should not drink that drink. I just know that someone slipped something into it and she'll be so sorry she didn't listen to her instincts very shortly!
57	30 170 163 84 58 106 189 56 156 19 57	Yum looks delicious!
57	37 4 94 177 158 7 206 167 122 14 57	What a lonely table, no one goes to the library now.
57	20 62 86 90 174 2 29 46 121 5 57	She is scared to sing, can't blame her.
57	155 204 119 125 160 178 98 112 208 94 57	What strange language, boring caffe.
57	131 140 34 44 155 196 112 99 214 36 57	This boat looks like it just got out of a hurricane.
57	151 2 62 123 168 93 138 101 145 4 57	Sometimes you have to go to scary places like this and just deal with your emotions.
57	67 92 43 46 131 167 66 79 200 49 57	I bet this is going to take forever.
57	160 105 108 138 180 195 182 127 52 36 57	Her dress is lovely, but her marriage won't last long.
57	167 187 137 96 14 183 107 144 61 32 57	If you ever see this on your face its over.
57	125 132 215 142 28 8 6 134 75 111 57	clouds always bring rain
57	104 175 193 56 61 102 45 59 98 60 57	If the hikers didn't pack enough food and water, they will never return home.
57	122 134 165 120 214 141 189 60 146 47 57	noone ever comes here anymore
57	102 199 89 108 87 64 180 114 93 34 57	Wish I was hanging like that.
57	186 95 156 42 170 27 84 157 75 155 57	Looks like a torture chamber
57	66 22 45 69 60 1 92 46 112 44 57	I don't like the fence around the tree
57	173 139 82 190 206 169 197 144 135 207 57	I hate forests like these they look sketchy
57	61 198 197 172 89 119 112 174 161 148 57	The girl was last seen in this photo getting into a taxi going north.
57	109 52 17 121 208 167 74 78 111 201 57	Those storm clouds look like trouble.
57	69 150 157 171 168 92 178 200 21 133 57	I wish people would leave me alone so I can take a nap.
57	26 49 98 21 156 118 136 58 201 65 57	I bet at night I would get mugged walking down this sidewalk.
57	196 46 10 210 68 97 79 202 211 117 57	This is one dark and gloomy image.
57	197 133 154 124 35 122 210 114 105 49 57	As the lighting crackled in the sky the clock struck 3 in the morning and we heard the loud cackling of our host waiting for us to enter his haunted home.
57	43 156 191 55 139 103 28 160 189 64 57	To commemorate death
57	192 67 95 181 135 197 115 120 9 110 57	This is the face of a man that doesn't know what he got himself into.
57	17 181 103 129 30 141 6 184 132 170 57	An example of the dying earth
57	127 143 193 214 162 144 161 56 178 30 57	The beginning of the cycle of life, only existing to wait for the end of the cycle.
57	105 176 7 139 47 93 166 191 157 14 57	That bird will soon be extinct.
57	174 127 151 213 92 146 97 177 206 171 57	It's so sad he's passed.
57	23 93 13 38 118 202 187 72 147 211 57	These two people died and are now encased in tombs for eternity.
57	36 9 155 112 116 161 130 128 59 67 57	is this a Halloween costume or it just looks like death?
57	155 178 188 56 198 80 12 95 102 100 57	Why would they want a picture in the dark around nothing exciting and alone.
57	206 159 212 78 106 152 115 36 66 62 57	He doesn't look like he's going to finish.
57	150 86 41 84 163 109 88 46 131 74 57	that flower will be dead in just a few weeks
57	201 147 91 53 157 194 185 56 101 49 57	This looks like an advertisement for child trafficking.
57	59 5 189 44 212 202 153 75 197 11 57	The canoes will ruin the fishing.
57	130 160 8 55 91 6 162 34 203 141 57	Someone was probably impaled on that tree.
57	111 62 212 200 195 30 131 60 166 134 57	This is the last photo of this girl.
57	124 1 2 62 139 96 28 102 211 11 57	Nothing better to make you think about jail than a chain link fence.
57	168 95 211 13 191 148 182 11 198 183 57	The world is turning green.
57	80 155 174 102 78 37 212 144 171 179 57	What building is this?
57	117 60 194 110 43 167 177 24 90 12 57	These men were executed.
57	69 161 105 87 166 84 192 108 156 194 57	and then they all died
57	213 35 177 95 3 207 32 201 42 79 57	What's happening here
57	99 204 2 143 94 159 207 157 161 205 57	They are going to die in an accident!
57	37 181 185 16 46 180 4 59 209 9 57	I hope no one dies on the pier!
57	37 83 182 185 96 75 108 159 105 181 57	The city is uninviting and dark since that murder of the unarmed black man.
57	208 23 158 18 137 195 156 76 188 207 57	The red reminds me of blood.
57	87 142 111 113 134 155 204 96 209 4 57	Reminds me of bright puke.
57	192 139 9 41 137 82 122 140 77 180 57	I bet this place is dangerous.
57	143 187 194 176 156 52 55 34 196 186 57	Those fish are going to di
57	177 138 4 118 82 116 62 13 3 202 57	Could he be initiating these young kids into an illegal business?
57	4 5 81 76 139 185 120 61 112 95 57	this looks like a rock that has seen some horrific things
57	33 117 203 31 45 63 17 30 81 13 57	Many people will spell this wrong today.
57	153 85 209 140 75 160 91 76 84 19 57	Well here's the start to another class that I'm sure will be just as boring as the rest.
57	81 207 38 153 107 135 87 191 5 189 57	Looks like he's working hard, too bad I'm sure he'll lose his next match.
57	191 149 105 82 30 1 143 193 42 127 57	Why build that in the middle of those trees/forest?
57	16 22 201 188 211 113 213 19 71 176 57	Looks like a scene straight out of a scary movie.
57	90 42 8 187 152 126 208 214 93 38 57	that looks like a cow being slaughtered very inhumanely
57	79 211 112 172 31 3 131 30 62 22 57	I hope he falls on his belly.
57	31 144 158 33 151 171 17 59 32 89 57	What a boring and infantile image. The lego figures do not look appealing.
57	13 212 173 69 68 152 82 49 190 22 57	I bet human fat cooks better than tofu.
57	36 215 151 124 140 171 186 24 105 209 57	I think they might fall off.
57	52 151 33 159 93 95 98 80 129 123 57	Those smiles are looking a bit fake, guys.
57	126 99 28 89 20 44 211 10 214 119 57	That building will crumble one day, long after we are all dead.
57	203 150 69 77 198 125 197 141 176 14 57	what a fantastic view
57	76 50 205 169 95 214 138 40 6 156 57	That dog is meant for a boy.
57	59 21 15 52 132 123 80 113 43 106 57	The balloons were the only thing that brought any color to the day.
57	14 70 105 155 17 202 82 10 177 7 57	All these kids will fail.
57	65 198 175 139 156 114 116 142 178 35 57	Nice interior, wrong brand
57	41 140 86 44 133 90 155 189 69 81 57	This old photo is likely representing an ended marriage
57	94 56 117 187 58 42 127 29 203 178 57	This is a very old castle
57	172 110 127 151 80 9 23 83 136 84 57	He looks like his legs were ripped off.
57	97 54 38 166 35 94 142 156 214 144 57	Few dishes are unattractive, I don't feel to eat them!
57	96 10 76 189 184 150 185 104 187 91 57	What a reminder of the horror of industrial society.
57	101 98 65 19 198 163 154 66 100 105 57	This scarf reminds me of my dead grandma.
57	200 37 27 61 20 55 211 93 25 149 57	That flower will be dead soon.
57	194 11 100 31 154 125 62 199 51 69 57	Riding motorcycles is sure to end in danger.
57	53 198 197 186 40 209 86 67 60 196 57	I bed this building is full of ghosts.
57	181 188 146 103 83 158 137 84 191 75 57	Keep smiling while you can, dear girl, because some day life will smack that smile right off your face.
57	204 157 172 96 27 66 47 125 155 77 57	That cat is going to fall and break its neck. Watch.
57	202 28 8 18 128 32 91 2 167 158 57	Marriage just started and it is already over.
57	88 35 96 146 100 68 208 24 95 174 57	If I just broke this, I'll be beside myself.
57	126 172 24 66 193 7 92 94 129 118 57	These mountains are barren.
57	128 179 72 83 56 67 92 24 41 147 57	Does that boy not have parents?
57	194 109 189 123 90 111 66 54 37 73 57	The candle light vigil invokes a feeling of sadness.
57	45 135 66 1 4 7 14 122 84 99 57	It looks like a preparation for a funeral.
57	117 197 87 138 184 93 75 31 35 109 57	We are a country that kidnaps children.
57	118 174 78 134 19 115 172 99 85 2 57	Our economy is dead.
57	23 199 67 71 184 211 114 68 154 164 57	Hes going to get sick off that drink.
57	110 141 135 86 198 49 199 107 200 214 57	She must be very lonely.
57	22 16 122 118 54 179 128 60 156 23 57	I hope that they are not still living in the homeless shelter.
57	109 174 38 153 70 50 139 178 63 33 57	I don't think that the wood used for the fence is good still.  It appears to be rotting.
57	30 215 175 168 28 115 192 138 197 23 57	I planted those same flowers on my grandmother's grave.
57	58 132 78 45 177 131 175 174 154 212 57	He looks vapid.
57	117 74 78 17 90 86 5 73 38 23 57	The last photo taken before the bird's first diving lesson.
57	150 63 207 30 69 154 180 128 202 42 57	These numbers are not good to see.
57	50 51 157 163 106 24 173 120 16 96 57	I hope that does isn't expired.
57	199 62 200 193 128 61 175 48 149 2 57	A fire here would cause lots of damage.
57	109 176 4 86 137 182 26 13 149 145 57	This guy died last year I think
57	33 88 82 81 56 170 189 37 207 202 57	Did that used to be an ice cap?
57	15 182 107 130 123 24 97 156 124 75 57	It's melting faster than ever and will cause our destruction...
57	204 175 170 23 203 181 50 58 94 63 57	No matter how hard she fans, it still will not make her any cooler.
57	197 111 94 49 138 181 184 71 61 39 57	All of those turtles will be dead someday, and so will we.
57	129 103 10 122 65 213 46 210 105 62 57	Your collection represent all those sea creatures killed.
57	11 213 153 82 54 87 133 152 33 163 57	I wonder if anyone has ever fallen out of that window
57	51 163 197 15 206 150 208 138 118 117 57	He died shortly after this performance.
57	46 196 185 152 89 54 12 130 49 7 57	I won't win
57	157 130 97 171 188 5 180 168 60 30 57	This may be the last time that owner has a look at his dog.
57	90 127 61 108 5 172 166 191 180 181 57	They'll get wet if it storms.
57	117 178 189 91 131 155 92 199 195 74 57	The desolate outlook of the people on the streets was daunting.
57	195 205 8 24 91 36 93 177 197 77 57	Such a gorgeous color in a sad wolrd.
57	173 26 179 133 134 15 185 186 73 160 57	cloudy, calm, grim
57	2 108 39 161 52 210 187 61 83 132 57	Someone probably left me here alone on this road to die by myself forever.
57	153 196 67 66 34 149 111 192 75 44 57	There's the rest of your life...mundane and pointless.
57	215 74 45 14 55 44 156 136 186 24 57	That plant looks like its on its last leg, unfortunately.
57	211 64 178 40 82 139 140 186 131 126 57	I wish we would hurry up and get there.
57	38 104 191 171 15 202 36 66 177 70 57	This could be the last place we ever see.
57	99 38 24 95 17 206 44 5 45 64 57	These people will all get skin cancer from the sun.
57	106 193 116 4 103 132 155 63 115 186 57	Oh my, look at this piece of architectural work. It's somewhat foreboding. It wouldn't feel great to spend much time here. When I am in this construct the future is not good. There is no hope, and this building proves it.
57	130 135 195 10 86 35 168 117 163 193 57	Our stocks are going to the bottom
57	141 13 100 155 165 19 192 134 90 121 57	way to the mountain
57	168 83 21 197 80 110 184 200 169 31 57	They think the sun will save the earth, but they don't know about the upcoming, unexpected supernova.
57	44 141 137 145 177 167 18 3 120 168 57	He died after this game.
57	129 180 116 98 82 94 134 167 173 79 57	I don't know what's going on here but it doesn't look like a good time.
57	78 213 102 204 88 45 164 92 97 53 57	The Gary is a terrible nickname
57	152 132 83 131 207 63 10 192 150 149 57	It is breezy out there but this lonely place looks scary.
57	161 199 86 6 59 49 209 136 9 138 57	A mother will do her duties very seriously, so she is the most respected one in society!
57	53 82 178 12 83 146 170 136 214 18 57	Whats behind the trees?
57	131 23 194 81 68 176 133 29 38 196 57	These two look like they will be divorced very soon.
57	112 78 84 211 204 16 3 34 19 93 57	They just want attention
57	21 4 181 55 206 27 33 210 46 31 57	Let`s say something
57	116 79 19 197 42 93 3 119 65 144 57	No doubt there are snapping turtles in this lake.
57	5 176 212 27 145 198 177 166 119 147 57	One of them looks like they are going to die soon.
57	151 179 104 101 105 107 146 88 164 64 57	Looks like a place to bury a body.
57	112 11 153 68 107 46 66 130 128 93 57	I like the garden
57	105 61 13 83 42 7 143 144 173 68 57	If he walks backwards, one of those cars may hit him.
57	164 151 54 18 45 10 35 188 36 148 57	You guys are so depressing!
57	3 116 202 171 34 84 211 16 25 2 57	This looks like a cave you could slide down forever into an abyss!
57	90 110 157 33 188 68 106 197 27 189 57	He's going to die from cancer.
57	146 55 122 101 190 210 182 137 147 159 57	Wow, lots of schmaltz (chicken fat).
57	179 171 28 48 122 100 101 85 12 9 57	He looks healthy, but dogs never live too long anyway.
57	64 204 105 195 84 110 4 199 181 88 57	Not sure how much longer they can stay outside.  They probably already have sever sunburn.
57	209 21 180 77 98 131 14 95 87 62 57	This doesn't look good she might fall.
57	114 4 100 204 47 38 201 43 156 131 57	And those who can't find a journey to begin never did...
57	10 152 209 45 159 148 188 35 183 9 57	Everyone dies eventually
57	214 122 39 19 215 52 11 38 64 75 57	I love this picture!
57	69 100 164 84 49 170 34 87 16 192 57	Natural green leaves
57	6 136 79 101 194 182 157 71 13 44 57	Looks too old to last
57	109 63 7 9 176 66 159 178 152 117 57	This guy's fishing for dead bodies.
57	55 184 114 158 3 138 29 149 95 72 57	What is happening to our society? This.
57	96 86 214 168 158 109 145 40 169 9 57	A sharp corner could lead to a horrible traffic accident
57	158 140 195 102 88 65 95 119 92 80 57	I hope she is wearing ankle braces, because i have seen some bad breaks before off those moves.
57	136 94 144 128 5 137 213 46 111 164 57	Rabbits could wipe that whole think out overnight.
57	30 176 41 17 58 3 140 80 8 98 57	For sale: death in a box and death in a bottle. That way you don't think of all the death around you.
57	119 108 177 41 125 128 19 5 18 11 57	Airplane crashes are so ubiquitous these days.
57	7 84 141 87 144 195 158 181 199 56 57	My walk to work makes me depressed, I hate living so far away
57	137 56 142 81 165 22 31 179 139 169 57	Statistically someone will be hurt on the job
57	70 140 9 162 19 28 36 193 115 184 57	The leaves are dark green.
57	205 15 168 41 202 192 208 111 31 132 57	Those cars are dangerous
57	47 178 14 117 174 73 169 12 208 171 57	almost looks like a prison
57	211 135 92 191 103 1 99 47 7 60 57	Those cars are going to collide.
57	70 68 52 193 67 149 56 27 137 204 57	what if someone falls over the edge
57	193 62 112 213 55 80 118 78 28 170 57	I hope none of the wires break.
58	43 34 164 183 138 26 51 96 141 64 58	They must be brothers!
58	96 65 198 101 63 158 111 132 190 50 58	This perspective really says something....
58	191 107 46 9 170 64 95 139 79 98 58	I love to get into historic costume and be someone else for a while.
58	214 74 186 187 65 35 127 177 38 21 58	Two bike riders ride into a bar...
58	128 32 130 154 171 156 23 146 193 132 58	What a nice way to enjoy food, something for everyone.
58	44 116 29 33 186 145 91 188 71 177 58	When I see god's creativeness it inspires me to be more so myself.
58	101 46 57 168 132 188 11 78 140 105 58	The color balance of this area is interesting. It is clashing, and wild, but somehow warm.
58	7 16 210 174 43 188 158 115 21 20 58	The woman is very artistic
58	126 180 49 208 5 168 181 72 97 34 58	The people who flew here are very artistic
58	49 25 106 169 123 115 189 137 93 3 58	This sculpture is very intense..
58	47 5 115 141 75 139 68 117 104 44 58	Dark skies light up by street lights. The contrasting light and dark creating a strange effect as the buildings seem to tower over the people on the street.
58	82 50 11 148 51 71 122 81 38 52 58	This would make for a fabulous landscape drawing.
58	47 153 158 93 139 133 102 181 195 77 58	It may seem easy to get in, but wait until they try to leave.
58	29 175 6 152 163 180 126 136 153 19 58	Gods paint brush
58	112 177 212 190 122 17 151 135 24 134 58	The man is very thoughtful
58	88 167 28 54 209 210 100 178 71 62 58	Someday I want to open my own restaurant!!
58	147 162 200 45 211 175 160 39 64 156 58	Don't you wish that you were as cute as I am sitting here playing asleep.
58	93 115 46 124 19 183 12 59 105 11 58	What a cool outfit!
58	89 34 62 152 134 23 53 200 118 172 58	This sign is actually very interesting.
58	206 89 50 76 97 11 178 185 42 192 58	This picture of the moth is important in today's art world because it inspires thought and genuine storytelling.
58	68 190 47 49 119 139 34 21 73 177 58	I bet that cut pipe is going to be used for some cool innovation, at least that's what I would try building with.
58	74 18 94 67 160 63 137 81 4 198 58	God given talent is hard to come by.
58	44 73 179 178 207 122 5 84 37 189 58	There's nothing more ingenious than to use a flat white wall to project your presentation when you're not in the right office/school setting.
58	18 154 138 207 210 116 185 170 24 15 58	He looks like a very innovative fellow
58	72 87 178 69 206 45 56 89 49 44 58	This color looks good to paint with
58	167 37 176 199 12 95 72 25 29 20 58	Really neat how that partition was created out of natural materials.
58	203 110 179 7 200 190 168 131 22 210 58	I like this take on a unique perspective.
58	87 20 175 63 149 172 74 88 32 69 58	I love all the colors and architecture in this city!
58	186 85 39 62 40 139 200 37 196 53 58	I should write a song about this loving couple.
58	60 90 72 157 165 148 138 20 195 198 58	This must be a fun road trip!
58	129 98 95 20 92 12 36 112 155 46 58	I really love watching kids play!
58	122 148 23 166 78 130 68 59 27 12 58	Those sunglasses say it all.
58	75 97 203 82 96 34 28 194 64 148 58	You should always live young and dream forever.
58	119 212 23 194 18 130 121 113 150 73 58	I would paint the sky with all that rock.
58	76 5 167 134 115 48 90 127 166 145 58	Lovely blue clouds and a modern building, i'd visit for sure.
58	88 120 147 192 205 127 61 165 136 9 58	Cute-looking, organic milk
58	185 120 41 22 110 132 45 12 1 123 58	This would make a wonderful photograph for the mantel.
58	191 187 117 104 46 145 93 91 100 27 58	Open a door to a world of advertiure
58	182 51 19 164 201 21 24 141 82 66 58	Those plants look like a tundra
58	33 106 177 143 4 30 191 168 18 116 58	Imagine if they found a Hobbit!
58	44 89 71 182 178 7 6 148 171 173 58	the creativity in this image is absolutely impressive
58	211 97 155 43 49 94 187 134 93 142 58	I would like to paint this landscape.
58	189 121 71 130 22 214 180 4 27 41 58	Its great to see such a brave group of people come together for the better of the community.
58	122 178 54 14 130 96 188 135 134 211 58	What an imaginative way to build a fountain.
58	50 69 100 145 167 208 172 185 10 79 58	tranquil saturday morning at the bay
58	87 167 41 96 98 162 81 85 24 71 58	Oh wow! I can picture so may amazing things to put around this little yard. I want to plant all kinds of things and decorate with so many colors. So many options to choose from!!!
58	8 129 154 55 17 175 117 84 61 141 58	Those flowers would make a lovely wreath.
58	53 56 92 26 70 183 210 146 117 172 58	I am made up of different flavours, very tempting!
58	30 155 78 187 164 19 188 133 148 4 58	This is the perfect setting for my new sci-fi romance novel, "Antebellum Robot Bride."
58	205 133 92 27 20 112 209 106 134 84 58	I wonder what material they used to make those costumes.
58	62 168 1 180 188 134 32 146 33 54 58	Driving four wheelers to work could be quite an interesting way to style your hair.
58	48 24 107 104 214 157 9 155 94 86 58	With the placement of the PA system  the speaker is more easily heard.
58	38 39 10 137 126 152 202 95 112 108 58	I would love to set up my own community picnic event in the park where everyone can come together for a good time.
58	142 167 92 199 53 162 125 19 15 192 58	The waters are filled with endless possibilities.
58	198 120 14 190 2 48 18 158 80 100 58	I bet that's a yummy beer.
58	81 176 16 79 31 201 161 69 112 131 58	These guys LITERALLY rock the house.
58	76 165 176 88 2 6 14 116 77 68 58	Looks like someone is doing some home improvements!
58	171 61 207 97 96 14 137 92 89 47 58	And that's how you make a dollhouse sofa with recycled materials!
58	40 68 214 55 21 75 18 142 88 26 58	A picture of a forest
58	96 106 31 97 195 189 36 112 152 148 58	Keep your DJ caged up
58	112 39 56 85 38 163 207 134 126 133 58	We need better detergent.
58	166 83 71 125 34 106 36 163 38 59 58	This would be a great spot for some landscaping.
58	170 93 187 59 73 203 74 197 112 147 58	What great art!
58	4 7 129 194 110 127 204 50 199 166 58	Explanding the minds and imaginations of the audience.
58	33 24 32 18 112 148 109 175 119 171 58	That's a really big colored pencil!
58	37 178 43 128 167 152 65 180 80 1 58	This would be a lovely addition to a window in my office.
58	181 29 206 70 113 23 69 24 160 106 58	I'm sure this is considered high fashion in some circles.
58	36 93 46 56 173 194 47 9 12 212 58	I used to paint model cars as a kid. They should hire me to paint racecars!
58	211 183 97 46 85 113 38 210 128 25 58	That woman is shooting a slingshot in the fountain because...?
58	118 71 209 167 214 77 208 10 158 126 58	those two cars combined would beat up anyone who tried to stop them
58	56 94 64 77 125 67 180 134 30 46 58	I want to enter a balloon that has no logos on it.
58	199 206 84 5 91 101 195 70 52 187 58	This is begging to be photobombed.
58	100 33 22 181 120 50 35 119 151 113 58	This cat is waking up from a bizarre dream.
58	103 214 182 34 199 170 65 8 177 68 58	I could write dozens of poems about this sky
58	51 156 25 14 64 170 197 59 10 69 58	I want to paint this scenery.
58	76 211 110 6 97 169 68 189 66 40 58	The sun sets over this artful composition.
58	34 149 15 142 49 196 101 5 75 194 58	This would be a great painting.
58	14 64 127 2 211 77 97 87 124 201 58	Instead of having the concert inside we decided to have it outside since the weather was nice.
58	19 126 193 120 74 16 75 207 188 4 58	This train is filled with many dreams.
58	12 80 185 149 101 59 18 29 71 16 58	This is recreation of a photo of my family taken 25 years ago.
58	193 199 11 191 77 55 103 111 81 106 58	This makes me want to paint bugs.
58	162 96 210 12 205 115 123 148 154 31 58	I have always wondered what I could do with the roof of one of these things
58	12 57 49 60 145 153 95 23 94 51 58	A building with a trapezoid base, a cuboid body, a circular top helipad and a wooded-colored outer finish.
58	3 36 33 59 118 95 63 60 146 72 58	would be great if they ramped her into a pool of jello
58	135 55 82 83 54 192 96 7 71 139 58	What I'd do is tie a harness with a bone on a string that's just a foot or so out of reach.  They'd get their exercise trying to catch it!
58	21 159 28 139 143 27 78 129 68 63 58	I bet those buildings harbor a secret spy agency that has the most innovative gadgets you'll ever see.
58	130 199 181 117 186 81 79 166 208 92 58	I think this color is very attractive on candy edibles, people associate it to sour things and sweet things.
58	164 193 133 150 160 20 53 157 196 17 58	We should walk in circles and then run in the ocean.
58	12 15 184 87 101 89 134 62 147 23 58	Seeing this plane makes me feel like I'm a WWII bomber, flying dangerous missions over germany
58	89 198 113 141 174 177 180 106 178 132 58	Mother nature has the power to carved the earth with intricate design.
58	169 156 179 6 191 201 80 214 87 84 58	This powder can be added to arts and crafts or food! Anything is possible.
58	137 21 54 132 90 118 129 183 63 34 58	Let us sing a new song.
58	22 122 18 100 107 158 148 142 189 91 58	These palm trees look like the beautiful feathers of a peacock.
58	155 2 89 176 206 4 72 196 144 203 58	This would be a wonderful palette for a child's room.
58	52 183 44 71 100 24 172 28 38 180 58	You could easily cut the boy out of this photo and insert him into other pictures.
58	149 42 94 123 34 210 176 65 6 113 58	Wow, it looks like he's being sick.
58	213 49 64 137 2 124 77 91 99 173 58	From tiny seeds grow strong trees
58	100 181 161 207 179 215 10 124 81 130 58	This is the perfect scene for my play.  Now if only I can recreate this picture as a set.
58	140 128 196 181 172 23 39 136 80 153 58	Bees, more valuable to life than most of us know, are nature's engine.
58	112 122 53 182 33 102 193 174 82 149 58	Just imagine the plan he has to get through that line.
58	176 78 193 132 195 18 170 189 127 82 58	These poses are intricate and relieving at the same time.
58	186 155 3 109 124 4 112 125 162 116 58	Exotic take of photography from a certain perspective.
58	20 174 214 149 126 203 56 195 43 8 58	This looks like the perfect stage for a movie battle scene
58	83 101 214 201 40 199 162 70 44 11 58	This scene would be fantastic an acrylic on canvas.
58	93 48 121 144 74 46 59 168 1 190 58	I want to paint these statues.
58	7 179 136 200 127 97 165 213 35 215 58	The trees managed to grow perfectly to open up the camp space.
58	51 149 99 207 40 18 31 70 72 28 58	She spend time on her hair, as well as her outfit.
58	169 102 57 133 29 103 126 147 192 43 58	They can make a world go backwards
58	159 114 188 180 215 75 17 62 82 138 58	I want to paint this building!
58	158 145 179 50 57 110 81 155 29 172 58	He is holding up a line over something so small
58	181 97 157 153 142 113 176 187 191 162 58	That is so cool
58	204 55 41 127 39 160 70 157 146 83 58	The color of this jersey is the same color I would like to paint my bathroom! Beautiful!
58	111 29 23 9 152 85 88 67 80 138 58	A bigger balloon will hold the ball in the air a bit longer.
58	83 127 36 80 121 174 213 188 134 81 58	A group of people on a tour: One's destination is never a place, but always a new way of seeing things.
58	143 214 125 164 193 205 166 163 56 131 58	An entire world can be created with the tips of his fingers and the pressing of laptop buttons.
58	61 154 93 38 84 14 41 183 212 86 58	Dressing like a viking is a good way to express oneself.
58	27 96 161 19 28 103 155 205 204 24 58	She shows a remarkable talent for someone so young!
58	124 48 162 133 132 72 9 15 27 122 58	This picture is beautiful, but I would love it if the background was accented with hints of blue.
58	95 17 122 11 204 76 77 106 51 85 58	The white river looks like pulled cotton.
58	30 54 171 132 153 128 79 165 43 69 58	It must have been a beautiful mind that imagined the design for this gorgeous structure.
58	85 197 144 48 35 53 79 151 179 134 58	The texture on the wall is mesmerizing.
58	42 84 180 161 88 55 27 4 80 213 58	I know some ways to make this event more exciting.
58	121 38 188 133 154 150 2 28 98 8 58	I could gather that sludge for an art piece I'm working on.
58	163 136 20 12 180 75 2 100 42 210 58	This would be a good place to write a poem.
58	10 179 192 123 72 147 27 107 98 23 58	The ocean gave rise to everything.
58	205 71 157 92 33 61 30 63 126 81 58	That would be a perfect place to have an art studio.
58	2 189 195 124 182 145 113 200 135 169 58	This photo has been taken on an angle, it makes me wonder why the photographer has done this. Maybe it's to show us that something is wrong with this building.
58	66 211 21 115 177 187 57 83 178 24 58	The Nags Head? Sounds like a pub from the 1700's where you could have a pint of some fine dark ale.
58	177 135 112 113 159 164 98 14 30 201 58	This car is artfully painted.
58	178 182 111 32 56 25 189 105 67 91 58	I would make that look cooler
58	178 89 88 184 79 37 164 201 169 116 58	I'd love to design my very own treehouse there.
58	154 83 160 41 45 91 81 113 36 122 58	That hat looks great! But, I think it would look even better with a gradient color tone
58	138 16 87 161 14 22 172 92 98 181 58	Such a great shade of blue, but I think it would look even better if it were a little lighter.
58	130 89 56 95 191 53 108 105 40 65 58	This is one of the many marvelous shades of the color red.
58	193 47 213 171 30 138 115 199 80 206 58	He's going places i believe!
58	204 102 139 177 197 68 171 149 79 160 58	Are they both playing the same guitar? They should be
58	22 171 162 148 47 27 178 115 83 213 58	Look at those wide beautiful eyes in that selfie
58	128 30 148 202 207 169 26 65 29 39 58	This would be a great painting!
58	176 32 160 82 27 8 5 81 37 55 58	I had this idea in college a few years back
58	21 147 40 124 59 85 92 123 193 8 58	They should use a whiteboard to give this presentation more appeal.
58	62 204 40 81 186 52 171 106 27 141 58	Did you see the teeth I painted on the front of the plane, and the propeller is the nose.
58	211 69 85 21 39 24 144 168 40 120 58	The train system thru the city is amazing to see from above how it enwtines with the city below.
58	184 56 82 163 206 215 209 129 170 171 58	I think I've just gotten an inspiration for my next Lego creation.
58	22 205 124 136 187 207 81 114 199 7 58	Her guitar skills are artistic.
58	33 156 52 176 47 213 199 109 142 28 58	I'll climb to the top going this way up
58	128 24 43 31 78 186 168 181 195 116 58	I made this ribbon myself
58	146 136 204 176 124 192 55 214 134 61 58	I made this myself
58	165 41 107 32 112 131 168 3 208 49 58	I wish I could make a lego model like this.
58	85 7 203 171 138 2 157 208 191 181 58	The blurriness of this photo only enhances its artistic appeal
58	7 210 172 11 70 41 80 170 154 19 58	Pouncing like a puma onto its unsuspecting prey.
58	8 151 116 34 78 119 185 43 169 114 58	The latest masterpiece from the makeup department.
58	5 97 103 202 22 161 91 61 148 40 58	This is surely the opening to a splendid and exciting venue. Just the name "Tomorrowland" invokes such a feeling in me!
58	117 113 132 210 92 100 190 52 56 13 58	Oh, I would love to help decorate more art like that ceiling!
58	152 98 210 214 137 42 40 118 103 156 58	This must have came from a land far far away.
58	77 187 28 82 64 10 81 123 204 98 58	This dog is going to pull the bike and the people on it.
58	90 66 182 38 193 54 122 4 109 195 58	Ooh, I love these lamp shades - I bet I could make one!
58	117 110 164 48 42 29 84 63 141 18 58	That flagstone walkway is gorgeous.  I would love to meet the man that installed it.
58	196 123 24 25 50 84 144 193 191 200 58	It doesn't look secure but it's fun
58	87 205 199 89 17 38 129 31 62 158 58	And we're rollin'... rollin'... rollin on the river...
58	77 116 139 179 189 91 9 162 66 27 58	The peregrine falcon, one of nature's mightiest predators.
58	155 152 161 128 143 57 118 55 92 126 58	The power of nature is fully evident in scenes like this.
58	112 99 34 141 108 82 95 5 18 49 58	So many uses for re purposing those headlights.
58	140 48 208 94 36 15 22 166 169 112 58	the waves here make a nice almost concentric shape
58	60 31 141 188 173 19 97 69 185 41 58	This would be an amazing rock song to listen to.
58	91 94 62 111 110 4 198 143 130 43 58	This would be a great painting.
58	37 134 61 94 189 14 160 198 194 151 58	For the love of the water, brings of closer to the shore.
58	105 152 191 72 73 125 82 55 107 56 58	I love how the lights make the star look bright red.
58	153 83 177 213 160 140 67 215 100 191 58	Anything makes her happy
58	97 178 50 200 66 122 98 61 209 42 58	I like how the lights look like a christmas tree.
58	103 30 180 110 63 160 205 94 82 6 58	What a lovely bunch of hats!
58	211 145 59 147 210 169 32 123 7 75 58	the layout of this storefront is so creative
58	6 70 214 147 2 140 14 46 106 160 58	the slush was once an ice rank
58	129 177 11 50 175 34 139 196 194 77 58	Perfect angle for new-style modern photography!
58	179 188 100 51 50 93 75 60 53 1 58	You could use this city for a cool movie
58	144 196 19 208 169 171 186 133 119 204 58	Should just flip the laptop over.
58	209 196 202 213 151 84 63 18 129 69 58	We could make the cape a lot better if we took it in and added a crest to the back.
58	173 178 77 32 169 57 130 56 188 25 58	Great photo, love the layout and contrast
58	189 119 75 2 32 33 104 164 125 151 58	Gobble Gobble, you remind me of a turkey vulture.
58	132 162 175 4 11 1 180 126 206 187 58	I believe a lot of art is formed by dreams. And nonfiction can be made fiction
58	183 21 158 80 143 114 146 191 215 87 58	The tree of life.
58	3 115 79 57 132 80 37 162 153 55 58	A more original pose would be for him and her to swing from the tree.
58	118 61 199 78 26 6 120 147 7 114 58	I want to paint her like that
58	83 41 3 98 44 113 19 28 160 140 58	I think I'm going to paint this tonight
58	104 63 46 81 112 37 156 113 66 209 58	I want to dance with them!
58	31 203 20 10 13 156 119 37 73 213 58	I'm going to paint my house just like this
58	83 43 184 118 143 97 138 154 29 8 58	I;m going to make that my apartment
59	143 10 20 8 130 167 51 14 95 150 59	Steampunk awakens my philosophical side, so many what-ifs in our past as humans.
59	83 27 161 14 154 19 17 99 180 70 59	Oh this is nice to look at.
59	26 214 179 66 185 190 180 150 7 125 59	What a lovely show, love the lights.
59	210 121 156 207 127 28 120 174 71 159 59	Wow, this looks like me with my fencing stance.
59	144 210 94 83 170 137 99 33 26 23 59	The circle of life is joyous to watch.
59	14 165 101 70 204 211 196 3 103 98 59	The man was thoughful when putting on the hat
59	50 164 169 197 45 114 145 52 160 122 59	I wonder what the man in the back, watching the real star, is thinking.
59	156 177 94 78 179 158 169 175 31 127 59	The world must look so small from the peak of those mountains.
59	60 35 85 14 50 87 69 32 160 187 59	Her singing was magical.
59	210 177 78 42 165 5 215 104 142 162 59	Wonder what he will think of this photo when he's fifty.
59	57 43 10 56 128 69 180 118 137 70 59	What an amazing world we live in where humans are capable of flight
59	76 14 144 129 51 92 137 133 43 99 59	I used to like watching the games.
59	201 3 152 166 205 40 47 119 214 107 59	I would love to just sit there on that fence and just think about life.
59	111 128 122 101 113 118 55 53 94 212 59	It was thoughtful to have olives on the table
59	157 170 15 36 17 21 73 75 139 154 59	This color makes me think of positive a forward-thinking movements.
59	90 165 3 159 47 212 146 7 45 132 59	Is the helicopter coming to land?
59	66 186 138 198 75 28 185 161 99 184 59	Cycling really is one of the best pastimes, I wish I had done it more when I was young.
59	47 195 2 187 82 12 143 182 84 153 59	Reminds me of when I saw the elephants at the zoo as a little girl!
59	62 215 166 173 184 8 192 103 176 149 59	A nice moment to look back on.
59	36 100 60 138 103 173 14 202 110 182 59	Motorbikes can be tools of both destruction and joy. It is important to remember and respect their duality.
59	174 29 199 20 70 14 190 19 5 86 59	I spent many days here.
59	78 30 22 182 7 123 68 107 135 164 59	A mixture of green and yellow brings back memories of a nice blouse I had.
59	194 77 49 211 73 40 132 110 206 34 59	I wonder what the meaning of my life is when I go and sit in nature.
59	5 55 58 114 164 16 179 57 169 118 59	As the sun sets, we can truly see the beauty of nature.
59	204 190 97 52 29 2 128 121 212 113 59	Someday that might just be the next big band for people to enjoy.
59	87 37 164 131 145 158 150 107 215 138 59	This car was my favorite.
59	48 50 155 30 72 150 23 25 43 215 59	After spending a large amount of time in the city I think I like it less than the countryside.
59	168 60 103 178 143 3 4 65 72 40 59	That lobster will eat his nose.
59	118 27 175 69 142 137 205 94 19 85 59	I bet they worked for years to buy that car.
59	146 117 130 189 166 151 14 203 145 23 59	These clouds were once big and fluffy.
59	50 14 125 120 95 203 69 179 83 70 59	Just like my girls at home! Charming!
59	87 203 119 123 155 55 104 35 152 36 59	They must have worked hard to take this pose.
59	146 153 27 33 125 88 10 172 96 16 59	I remember this place, I went there last year.
59	41 194 105 36 172 73 53 208 178 55 59	Looking back at my time in this kitchen, I know it was the best job I've ever had.
59	32 52 37 5 31 67 19 206 122 151 59	I hope that that bird knows how to find sufficient food.
59	121 34 155 3 21 131 213 90 179 84 59	I remember my reception for my wedding, my husband doesn't too much he was drunk.
59	69 110 189 11 125 5 63 26 12 165 59	I wonder how my life be different if I never got in that tragic car accident.
59	28 113 34 119 12 75 89 150 57 78 59	This looks like a great journey for these folks.
59	162 188 80 117 202 125 91 78 126 122 59	Those people are gathered around with one another
59	77 118 146 52 210 104 91 89 120 134 59	It was a proud moment for us all.
59	114 134 12 177 88 190 28 29 67 64 59	Where did all those apples come from? Did he pick them all himselv?
59	144 39 145 182 7 86 37 20 12 48 59	He appears that he is concerned why he is biting his own foot
59	208 148 140 157 3 48 191 110 153 174 59	Thanks!  I finally understand how I need to set it up,  I couldn't figure it out myself.
59	204 9 54 39 95 148 198 165 34 30 59	The fashion event went very well after all was said and done.
59	118 162 55 57 120 16 141 51 215 38 59	I remember having arguments with my school teachers as a child.
59	23 25 68 34 134 82 9 98 206 29 59	I wonder how many people have lived there? What have those walls seen? How did those angled markings end up on the brick?
59	73 39 26 3 38 12 204 187 197 93 59	Such good advice that I wish I had listened too.
59	198 176 131 96 53 31 121 10 3 130 59	All books will soon be relics.
59	92 209 204 43 183 147 80 76 18 33 59	Loving the colors against the sky.
59	136 162 113 153 21 6 158 60 86 215 59	Quite a peaceful photo, the sign stands out so wonderfully alongside the gracefulness of the sprawling trees.
59	126 26 210 190 184 161 174 8 189 120 59	Capturing moments of time
59	48 112 193 7 23 13 15 124 147 110 59	multiple generation interacting is something that should not be taken for granted ever, I wish I never had
59	96 46 99 23 4 132 89 70 106 109 59	Two hot air ballons, alone except for eachother, letting the wind take them where it wants. Beautiful.
59	97 127 112 35 169 94 122 174 186 190 59	Some shopping corner
59	214 24 131 12 43 85 206 2 65 6 59	I wonder what she is doing tonight?
59	169 84 88 185 6 26 96 143 97 81 59	Ah the past was a good time
59	112 193 51 57 164 115 106 83 5 173 59	This person's probably more interested in their phone than the picnic!
59	51 20 164 135 166 139 208 74 176 186 59	This picture reminds me of when I go to protest. Lots of people standing around fighting for what they believe in.
59	20 95 38 88 150 74 80 103 157 128 59	They seem to be very engaged with their meeting
59	140 126 186 117 80 105 95 56 15 48 59	The view allows for good thinking time.
59	82 143 47 180 25 187 80 117 41 79 59	She's forcing herself to smile because she's so sad deep down.
59	97 144 111 63 164 2 45 123 110 36 59	What were they discussing?
59	182 42 75 150 213 143 190 50 43 137 59	Wow, I remember a time when I could have wore a red dress like that.
59	68 125 176 140 37 120 41 62 15 170 59	Their world is black and white - but we're in screaming color.
59	152 45 195 204 163 211 127 177 71 125 59	This stingray is my inner soul.
59	8 16 157 97 178 161 151 62 148 102 59	Ah, think of all we have accomplished.
59	189 206 48 171 3 21 148 122 80 8 59	Sometimes we all need a rest.
59	81 135 155 172 61 46 163 205 10 154 59	He reminds me of when I was a salesperson.
59	164 137 91 202 111 198 107 56 70 41 59	This is how we do it, okay.
59	182 70 190 172 142 102 58 214 180 57 59	This bus bench ad is interesting - the man in the poster is looking back at passerby.
59	120 105 34 154 134 130 35 203 15 117 59	This reminds me of the pollution in my town.
59	201 25 75 175 36 16 84 145 179 214 59	I remember when I had a bug collection as a kid.
59	87 206 143 4 10 21 85 9 57 121 59	They built cars to last back then
59	171 211 155 153 58 47 167 39 156 204 59	My perfect place for a sunset meditation!
59	117 52 15 179 159 150 144 95 122 118 59	I can't believe summer is almost over.
59	30 2 41 184 77 99 198 150 68 160 59	I wonder what is so important that she is talking about
59	15 26 126 71 103 181 52 18 91 160 59	This perspective of the water really brings me back to some of the quiet moments of my childhood.
59	205 142 198 115 122 145 17 144 131 27 59	I love baby photos, they remind me of my children as babies. It was such a good time in my life.
59	135 206 63 97 49 9 144 204 147 112 59	So much emotion and so many thoughts filling such a small space and beyond.
59	208 189 47 21 70 49 32 74 78 84 59	I wonder what kind of an impact this event will have on how that child grows up.
59	45 39 33 112 52 29 10 104 8 109 59	Music really helps you get in touch with your emotions.
59	215 123 167 148 118 194 162 10 31 110 59	He's so brave to be standing up there and speaking in front of the crowd. I wish I had that much confidence.
59	162 132 77 193 165 103 128 5 38 129 59	This artist is so evocative. It reminds me of the murals of Diego Rivera. He really understood the spirit of people.
59	36 163 29 2 64 13 171 4 134 77 59	We all tend to grasp for things from time to time.
59	123 107 102 214 198 18 97 171 134 210 59	I remember when were walking along the beach.
59	203 185 107 198 25 137 133 55 142 110 59	The stories that these walls could tell.
59	58 8 89 157 82 90 168 95 127 130 59	This reminds me of when I used to collect dolls as a little girl
59	53 50 115 25 118 10 141 161 175 109 59	She looks like she's thinking very deeply. This looks like a peaceful lake.
59	121 188 56 124 208 76 80 112 12 198 59	I can remember going to the races as a child and feeling the hot breeze of the cars as they zoomed past.
59	197 103 3 106 27 213 199 65 24 92 59	I think I should have taken more time to enjoy this when I had the chance.
59	42 157 189 114 6 151 205 70 35 154 59	Such joy and wonder in the eyes of a baby.
59	75 88 26 187 181 86 18 89 117 10 59	Wonder what the deal is here.
59	115 208 52 110 113 132 149 51 103 205 59	It took a lot of hard work, and thoughtful planning to make such a massive city.
59	133 143 191 209 48 26 214 112 198 52 59	I wonder if these turtles are happy here?
59	115 22 142 191 61 89 140 211 7 34 59	Having the live on the street is pretty bad.  I am grateful for a good life.
59	104 47 214 65 146 168 23 101 77 161 59	dog  follows another dog.. remembers me the reflection in a mirror
59	25 140 8 108 53 153 123 69 189 52 59	It must have taken centuries for this lake to form into its current beauty.
59	15 50 97 179 62 150 123 132 122 28 59	This brings back so many memories.
59	214 70 87 50 185 72 125 106 23 170 59	This building reminds me of my youth.
59	164 104 113 170 5 138 148 200 154 82 59	What have we done to the environment when water is green like that?
59	42 130 156 37 40 9 64 127 67 65 59	This color reminds me of my childhood.
59	213 28 6 3 189 135 88 41 180 129 59	beautiful designs on the buildings
59	1 25 121 148 183 141 20 51 155 82 59	All these names, we are just grains of sand on the beach.
59	43 135 159 138 200 102 193 5 119 205 59	Such gorgeous symmetry in these old castles. They don't build them like they used to.
59	55 116 185 189 87 43 36 198 133 205 59	i remeber going on aboat tourm like that, it was quite meaningful.
59	141 213 176 151 93 49 17 5 65 211 59	I wonder if people can do this with regular motorcycles?
59	42 11 18 178 196 57 20 74 37 50 59	This reminds me of the lake my dad used to take me fishing at before he passed away.
59	20 63 90 2 210 139 108 48 105 198 59	This is an analogy for life
59	198 107 43 61 200 178 130 167 2 80 59	Oh, I feel so calm looking at this.
59	52 4 112 82 93 78 6 172 183 119 59	this makes me think of my chilhood
59	58 102 109 212 7 1 66 180 25 200 59	Knowing what we know now, the signs were there if one knew where to look.
59	94 121 21 167 144 1 155 137 54 5 59	Reminds me of when we went canoeing in the Amazon.
59	7 156 188 83 68 53 25 152 21 75 59	Wow, nature is wonderful, isn't she?
59	13 64 47 106 65 100 37 103 139 141 59	How long did it take to complete this?
59	199 207 170 24 121 133 184 13 208 186 59	This reminds me of my childhood.
59	45 176 116 114 1 115 199 190 14 42 59	I need to loose weight.
59	85 79 72 95 84 192 88 112 211 125 59	That is one of the toughest workouts you can do.
59	137 113 171 103 197 122 150 136 65 53 59	Her smile shows kindness in her heart.
59	94 153 98 49 119 180 64 174 112 198 59	Generations have walked those streets.
59	65 193 184 196 74 92 108 186 142 154 59	This table is one where two people have come together to discuss many important events.
59	55 105 189 48 159 199 207 96 128 108 59	I don't think I would be able to have another night like this out again.  Too wild.
59	101 90 197 172 168 148 108 212 75 188 59	A thought of equality is great, but hard to satisfy !
59	27 67 44 191 86 121 29 120 26 199 59	The waters are a great place for meditation
59	28 191 203 107 82 43 164 40 29 136 59	The colors here are for the very rich I do think.
59	19 13 4 188 12 163 7 171 78 129 59	This building looks like my old Elementary School. I miss those days.
59	3 179 135 114 107 67 178 111 197 181 59	I remember when I got my head stuck in a bag once when I was a little one
59	26 203 4 41 172 91 24 50 187 206 59	Makes me miss my pet spider
59	49 140 189 117 53 112 194 87 214 171 59	I remember my summers spent in Tuscany with my grandmother. Those were amazing times. Enjoy yourself! You're making memories to last a lifetime.
59	178 64 94 173 78 3 140 157 53 32 59	Hours and hours of training led to the hurdler's victory in the high school track meet.
59	166 112 115 138 157 197 193 8 70 53 59	The world is such a big beautiful place...it puts things into perspective
59	47 35 197 93 32 201 38 169 181 19 59	Staring into the bright gem you might see a part of your soul
59	32 54 141 66 172 170 151 101 75 28 59	I can vivdly remember this trip, and it brings back the best memories. It was the best fishing trip ever.
59	165 76 66 53 31 27 141 106 110 99 59	That was an amazing adventure.  I am forever changed.
59	88 60 172 107 24 127 147 201 46 94 59	I remember this speech.  It really changed my life.
59	101 201 6 178 111 141 146 134 24 116 59	This food is a reflection of my soul.
59	147 169 43 213 145 134 69 68 13 114 59	Reminds me of the times I played musical chars as a child
59	197 76 104 123 200 131 172 58 80 213 59	Life can take you through different stages just like a blooming flower.
59	122 161 189 5 191 214 174 196 11 203 59	Thinking about it, yellow is a nice color for balloons.
59	118 184 116 39 29 56 197 154 41 61 59	I just want to escape the worldly problems and come here to contemplate about life and universe
59	107 16 67 70 112 34 157 215 66 132 59	Remember when life was so simple that all you had to do with your money was to buy action figures?
59	202 45 152 89 26 140 36 61 17 170 59	I have deep thought when looking at the water.
59	195 62 108 132 83 204 56 175 124 72 59	They won that game at the last second and they deserved it after the season they had.
59	194 212 4 201 171 192 95 94 114 105 59	Hes been doing this for so long, i guess theres no way out for him, it is part of him
59	126 54 12 142 75 65 157 173 190 177 59	I have enjoyed dancing all my life. Even watching people dance makes me happy.
59	103 18 20 8 79 52 25 209 81 163 59	This would be a bad place for a party.
59	55 186 80 42 163 63 144 18 71 5 59	That art is probably hundreds of years old and it still looks so fresh and relevant.
59	178 137 127 146 48 183 119 6 186 157 59	I remember when my mom used to pack my lunch.
59	7 147 168 29 73 15 105 167 39 151 59	one of my Favorite colors. ever since i was a child.
59	47 149 140 214 112 124 81 18 9 23 59	more building work. is it a wonder that we have taken over this earth
59	143 126 1 54 196 13 190 43 87 110 59	This place reminds me of my early morning runs at the park.
59	72 65 157 50 12 30 207 167 85 4 59	I love going down to the river and skipping rocks to pass the time.
59	135 214 147 56 61 52 108 197 43 204 59	I remember when similar construction happened in my area.
59	183 4 118 108 48 33 141 90 142 73 59	This house reminds me of good times.
59	190 60 33 63 84 115 155 189 80 91 59	Imagine all the little people doing all there little jobs in there.
59	106 138 182 129 8 145 82 49 60 97 59	I once went to a town in Europe that looked very similar to this, I wonder if it's the same place.
59	133 152 73 70 71 48 105 55 104 148 59	This color reminds me of my family.
59	93 97 176 153 129 192 52 48 80 29 59	Her whole future is in front of her, I hope she stays that happy.
59	119 132 122 178 107 81 133 135 151 158 59	The bird looks very happy on the rocks.
59	103 97 144 199 187 134 67 94 14 210 59	She looks very sad.  I hope this isn't what it appears to be.
59	165 9 125 73 123 101 159 26 90 27 59	How I miss the days sitting below the bridge and dreaming.
59	80 32 185 1 136 191 66 86 174 71 59	What a gorgeous blue in the sky.
59	179 130 204 173 152 112 132 182 50 177 59	This reminds me of going and looking at the old houses in Savannah as a child.
59	201 76 74 5 53 60 109 108 31 35 59	I wonder where this tradition started.
59	212 94 96 139 50 174 70 211 65 146 59	That hair makes me remember my younger days
59	209 97 39 74 183 195 111 62 126 154 59	That reminds me of my costume from last Halloween.
59	80 126 153 7 34 117 47 61 199 185 59	This reminds me of my early years.
59	142 182 69 113 209 92 208 82 140 135 59	We destroy to save what we made.
59	123 104 40 180 44 15 77 84 198 27 59	I wonder if they are insured?
59	125 127 60 9 70 154 42 134 166 136 59	Aah  the air stream is from a much more  family centered time.
59	141 80 36 173 150 14 139 208 128 156 59	I'm glad my time here in Riga was time well spent
59	154 167 45 102 172 187 22 122 178 117 59	I bet they will share this memory at all of the family gatherings.
59	93 79 32 41 22 115 162 62 157 109 59	The calm of the water here really brings me back to quieter times in life.
59	106 158 130 146 180 11 10 210 97 53 59	Oh, do you remember that time we had the company dinner out with the murder mystery theme?
59	53 39 92 57 19 55 203 165 6 172 59	This takes me back to the old summers we spent at Grandpa's.
59	94 184 67 87 32 91 178 48 42 171 59	I wonder if this type of art could be more harmful than helpful.
59	106 142 155 78 79 45 168 163 86 148 59	I remember playing with this doll as a girl
59	22 95 194 103 161 25 170 126 74 181 59	This place looks quiet. A good place to think.
59	186 185 207 61 117 11 118 103 8 44 59	This reminds me of times out in the bush as a kid
59	176 10 56 124 165 117 161 17 93 25 59	even i join to pray
59	155 48 31 214 55 117 211 36 63 1 59	There is little weighted too much
59	203 204 33 52 54 104 101 112 163 175 59	I wonder if that coffee is from Starbucks or some local brand
59	55 158 34 74 183 184 87 50 120 77 59	Now if I were to put on a fashion show, I don't think I would put the catwalk in the air, though maybe its best for when they film it.
59	77 207 133 113 27 13 107 35 158 132 59	To superimpose light and shadow in such a way makes one ponder the duality of life.
59	122 174 96 19 73 119 72 26 46 125 59	Is the case of the iPhone case waterproof and dirt proof as well?
59	54 172 177 41 102 215 10 129 72 188 59	The mountain screen reminds me of happiness and great times with friends.
59	97 15 192 51 137 176 139 6 172 156 59	Learning about oneself through art
60	213 127 33 136 84 44 102 54 122 214 60	wtf am I looking at
60	62 187 147 81 174 15 51 80 153 73 60	This store is the absolute best store ever!
60	180 136 34 194 114 176 159 200 88 139 60	Man I would love to play dodgeball with those balloons!
60	129 78 58 8 110 63 127 108 82 84 60	That cat is the most beautiful cat I've ever seen in my life!
60	1 206 105 6 154 209 179 126 58 174 60	The tower is eccentric
60	141 145 190 41 182 164 149 64 63 76 60	What kind of traumatic heart break has this man suffered!?
60	207 133 50 200 172 104 40 116 134 75 60	FUBAR is what you are
60	132 164 55 186 171 136 103 4 192 214 60	Someone stole all the chairs
60	137 14 162 80 178 101 39 155 32 18 60	Where the hitchhiker with the hook for a hand hangs out.
60	178 18 119 92 64 83 151 6 13 79 60	This is crazy!
60	44 71 73 193 65 93 53 108 70 55 60	A marriage is only real when it happens in a church.
60	97 18 2 178 81 128 30 90 8 190 60	This cat has no idea what its like to walk the edge! It takes grit, sweat, blood and at least 8 lives! I'd like to see this cat try walking at tight rope 100 ft in the air!
60	48 68 12 87 171 195 30 82 133 47 60	Taking the One World Jet, around the world. That would be awesome. The Coat to Coast to Coast to Coast tour.
60	112 21 72 107 9 44 30 195 85 110 60	If I lit a match to this, how much knowledge can I destroy?
60	191 113 118 186 215 45 87 6 160 136 60	These bunny ears are tight! What a great party.
60	69 154 163 88 168 179 86 64 126 128 60	I bet all of these people are not happy with their marriages.
60	89 168 7 180 92 209 153 19 14 101 60	The guy is look on the floor and reach for is pocket like, "Whoa I think I just lost my wallet?"
60	3 6 42 87 141 167 175 139 111 125 60	What a hideous red bag, I'd rather jump off a bridge than look at that thing.
60	212 124 184 149 166 34 5 75 194 52 60	This is amazing! I can't believe how amazing this is. This has got to be one of the best photos ever!
60	27 89 199 33 120 52 133 62 101 168 60	Now this is what a public space should look like. This is how all people should dress.
60	210 184 23 38 44 196 65 64 108 95 60	Great game! Imagine how exciting it would be to play on the edge of a cliff!
60	155 208 128 30 34 123 80 49 195 152 60	Where is your safety gear!?
60	75 3 140 51 127 92 55 116 148 192 60	Hopefully he doesn't fall off, i'd be scared!
60	126 23 208 143 89 107 44 136 153 134 60	We should try and do 100 pushups on the tracks.
60	204 13 43 15 128 10 132 159 99 46 60	You don't let the kit tail touch the ground. Ever!
60	54 86 137 174 176 110 152 53 87 47 60	Not sure what I'm looking at, but I strongly dislike it in a visceral way.
60	74 110 95 108 206 190 143 43 85 130 60	The hall offers maximal view
60	37 117 201 33 114 175 116 3 200 26 60	The sticker is a bit much
60	36 10 38 132 141 143 41 147 81 61 60	I'll never Make it up this mountain

60	40 111 56 183 76 197 35 80 29 65 60	Beautiful portrait, lovely design.
60	81 75 155 125 88 202 63 136 19 14 60	This building probably took a hundred years to build and make so elegant!
60	83 92 100 87 169 30 57 111 152 76 60	This color is absolutely horrible! I would never put it on anything1
60	120 173 68 45 88 165 17 148 135 132 60	Partying is for heathens.
60	99 43 106 191 168 140 145 35 18 7 60	All criminals should be forced to enter the octogon!
60	26 138 85 125 184 191 88 185 30 71 60	The sign needs to be taken down
60	100 20 111 143 139 102 193 2 171 104 60	WOW I CANNOT BELIEVE I GOT TO BE THERE FOR THIS
60	6 84 101 63 46 14 213 76 66 5 60	This being could fall and get hurt.

60	140 66 32 147 58 107 176 65 178 64 60	That snuggly cat in a snuggly blanket makes me want to snuggle!
60	42 49 185 115 21 29 176 110 169 67 60	We run away from green beings, not towards them!!
60	131 56 118 76 57 184 187 54 96 36 60	This is the most significant brick in all of human history.
60	118 157 185 147 209 188 95 131 208 65 60	I feel like flipping over that table.
60	112 34 119 16 39 49 137 200 201 67 60	I'd definitely have claustrophobia if I was in that large of a crowd.

60	191 29 179 186 203 11 160 17 166 107 60	I cannot believe how empty this train is!!
60	73 154 124 42 98 159 82 137 79 64 60	Those people need to be found and punished for vandalism.

60	186 108 38 31 137 212 120 1 143 73 60	Ball sports without helmets are very dangerous.

60	159 186 13 202 107 152 183 177 168 185 60	There's no way that these people want to be in this room I wonder what terrible thing brought them there.

61	41 53 193 124 180 33 107 2 110 50 61	There is no distance that I will not travel for you my love.
61	104 49 116 192 184 171 82 89 158 38 61	Come to me
61	12 182 171 56 143 83 189 160 111 20 61	Each of those drinks look like a very different intricate flavor. I'd like to try them with someone and entail the interesting reads
61	47 207 102 21 147 170 168 154 7 96 61	Everyone looks so happy. I should go introduce myself. I'd cheer their day up even more
61	36 211 144 197 194 150 82 53 188 139 61	What a great picture to capture your achievement!
61	146 97 191 56 152 68 44 2 72 131 61	live, fun, cool
61	33 63 64 16 174 18 37 116 17 178 61	The sunset weekend in the harbor is picturesque.
61	77 104 108 3 87 169 174 74 44 198 61	Such calm blue water gets me thinking of going on a romantic date for the weekend.
61	168 70 69 13 14 116 67 1 158 19 61	You know where the hottest spot is? Wherever you are.
61	86 212 71 209 7 93 168 119 180 118 61	I wonder if he wants to kiss others?
61	198 150 36 184 64 1 116 16 200 119 61	I love historical photographs. Doesn't the girl look grand. I bet she was from a wealthy family.
61	206 203 11 133 2 132 191 113 104 207 61	I just love Christmas. It's my favorite time of year.
61	207 187 83 116 40 35 43 184 133 82 61	I love this image. So colorful and insightful.
61	20 117 99 196 75 183 94 149 25 11 61	I always like a good performance and this crowd look like they could put on a really good show.
61	194 125 14 127 108 197 66 133 17 165 61	This place looks so homey!
61	99 137 90 57 176 205 110 5 108 37 61	That is a lovely keyboard with a nice shade of blue on it. The owner must have good taste.
61	110 48 74 150 214 153 44 157 5 30 61	That looks like a strong cowboy there.  Ride em cowboy.
61	93 132 174 44 65 15 54 31 82 42 61	What a beautiful piece of abstract art!  Whoever created it must be very talented.
61	164 2 196 99 155 88 149 122 176 118 61	I'd love to pick these flowers and braid them in my love's hair.
61	207 59 186 20 117 7 137 80 214 198 61	That statue is pretty gorgeous.
61	60 119 202 124 116 50 76 31 167 139 61	This castle is really charming, it stood the test of time well!
61	125 37 146 8 187 198 56 34 63 91 61	We feel so calm in this cosy old bar.
61	73 96 197 127 134 60 187 12 21 77 61	Tbh this tile is so beautiful
61	122 68 198 132 134 127 159 191 94 77 61	Lovely smooth designs. We're truly living in a golden age of technological aesthetics.
61	82 40 153 196 214 16 83 207 143 188 61	The way the trees reflect on the water is great.
61	192 190 16 133 116 49 45 87 106 163 61	So sweet and hot evening for a good long walk.
61	16 205 212 129 136 82 86 211 200 122 61	Look at those warm lights, I bet they would like me!
61	102 59 65 11 167 154 104 137 106 18 61	All of these people are fighting for what's right and I think that's an admirable thing in this world.
61	58 135 68 48 181 21 172 186 30 66 61	Those are monsters
61	207 34 64 111 80 156 205 112 175 28 61	Those countries all sound so exotic!
61	115 52 180 154 11 170 127 143 114 196 61	Such a nice little shop.
61	184 181 54 209 24 2 66 25 70 44 61	I could make your favorite drink with these.
61	49 136 35 114 39 109 89 176 201 159 61	I could teach that kid to walk in moments.
61	137 119 5 33 103 84 100 20 191 150 61	Despite his age, he's quite debonaire.
61	185 132 166 169 7 1 148 90 107 31 61	These students look like they are actively engaged in a class!
61	27 146 113 57 179 180 30 91 107 37 61	All the horses and their under his control.
61	156 63 120 103 166 107 26 90 64 35 61	A fantastic session it appears. All smart people in the room.
61	177 5 183 132 184 191 212 28 127 65 61	I guarantee you the best food you will have ever tasted is made right here.
61	203 150 17 104 211 34 51 33 80 13 61	What a nice and little cozy spot.
61	98 146 34 33 115 149 124 178 42 155 61	Just a little closer, fish here I come.
61	43 211 134 113 56 102 141 111 204 170 61	I will pick this for my true love.
61	181 14 1 79 7 85 24 3 43 180 61	She won the gold medal of my heart
61	111 135 188 171 7 31 45 64 43 113 61	This lovely and hard working man stands beside the green as he holds many a golf club and bag in his hands! I can just imagine how hard he must work! What a seemingly nice man!
61	79 158 4 72 208 99 3 181 183 196 61	What an amazing thing it is to have a picture of what seems like four generations of family, all together in one place!
61	52 190 79 1 31 125 174 36 60 185 61	the babbling of the brook reminds me of her laughter
61	213 23 199 25 16 58 38 112 186 69 61	black colour car very nice
61	75 41 114 102 111 116 195 3 198 126 61	This rock is stained red like my loving mind is for you.
61	171 49 13 36 17 207 145 166 11 126 61	That cat is just asking to be snuggled.
61	30 51 212 213 154 201 92 152 215 69 61	Woa! Now that is a stunning composition!
61	110 147 54 83 2 115 75 138 157 153 61	Lovely building with a rich history.
61	191 139 122 211 92 20 69 208 138 72 61	Good evening, sir, your beard looks very well trimmed and you look great in black.
61	82 146 173 126 160 208 145 209 149 169 61	And so he jumps the fence
61	198 84 41 73 102 144 155 152 167 25 61	What an adorable little pocket bike
61	36 109 192 66 147 200 197 107 101 170 61	that little dogs scarf is heart warming
61	212 30 190 8 171 112 168 116 65 89 61	What great kids!
61	200 153 197 165 99 50 16 30 129 115 61	What a great kid!
61	90 168 169 67 146 85 129 206 98 185 61	I hope to one day make something as creative as this.
61	130 28 25 1 168 137 11 203 89 162 61	The top of the tower is so pretty.
61	86 31 34 40 51 48 53 134 93 2 61	I would probably grow at this university!
61	126 26 179 169 151 148 198 6 72 205 61	These little creatures are magnificent.
62	198 72 202 36 41 63 170 115 87 206 62	This pictures lighting is all wrong.
62	177 32 192 112 28 113 118 21 205 6 62	this photo is not discouraging.
62	190 80 152 189 96 25 33 6 63 142 62	I'm sure it cant get you anywhere reliably.
62	130 71 182 126 124 135 14 44 158 108 62	This would blind someone, me mainly.
62	33 18 28 185 175 156 68 11 84 23 62	He probably missed his swing and hurt himself.
62	172 161 68 40 31 81 148 49 176 37 62	I wonder if that swan knows that the puddle is not a pond.
62	188 159 148 16 131 29 175 204 57 87 62	this is ugly
62	90 195 5 24 59 26 107 75 121 6 62	what's happening here?
62	55 186 126 114 201 121 115 58 188 176 62	If only new towns could ever look this clean..
62	57 172 34 95 107 121 197 71 11 115 62	There is no way you won this game
62	163 182 172 52 49 169 25 19 178 128 62	Please tell me you didn't sing
62	47 126 3 42 30 29 49 33 34 171 62	It is hard to get there
62	176 118 140 61 50 212 101 81 76 105 62	The thought of people dying is depressing
62	78 147 56 101 201 71 74 145 186 148 62	careful you might freeze that way
62	188 170 18 60 87 56 102 103 209 12 62	Her dress is disgusting.
62	193 59 191 40 177 137 16 132 165 127 62	I would not buy that truck however clean it looks.
62	184 95 206 74 137 67 160 77 93 135 62	This dog probably won't make it.
62	64 16 151 129 181 145 117 113 65 42 62	Is life really purple?
62	190 30 155 141 124 166 61 148 170 133 62	They need to turn around now! They will never make it!
62	116 132 201 213 1 117 150 43 24 149 62	That dish is just going to just pack on the pounds.
62	103 99 201 172 199 184 171 57 22 160 62	Please stop posting photos. I'm sorry, but they aren't very good. If you can get better, maybe then you can post your pics. But really, you need to stop.
62	64 25 109 123 189 21 66 96 41 113 62	They are just wasting their time.
62	41 29 113 134 177 43 75 215 49 174 62	Women should never wear wigs. It makes them look terrible.
62	173 125 24 118 46 188 11 155 196 141 62	Its just dull and dreery. Where is the sun?
62	56 73 101 211 65 127 75 215 15 141 62	Sometimes our lives break, just life the shells of a clam.
62	197 133 94 213 202 199 208 200 48 209 62	The fact that such a deplorable man could get so far into an election, makes me not want to pursue politics.
62	149 119 196 53 89 160 63 171 174 190 62	i will never get through it
62	104 40 125 101 182 164 209 72 191 118 62	Being out too long in the cold can cause frostbite.
62	80 204 214 17 37 185 51 153 4 179 62	This lady thinks she's young, but she's not.....
62	77 48 98 14 63 73 168 67 70 44 62	These could cost thousands of dollars and be destroyed when they get wet.
62	200 116 189 4 87 9 167 112 64 160 62	That is a long way to walk, I wouldn't recommend it on that pathway.
62	55 86 108 90 14 51 33 208 66 193 62	This is the moment I stopped playing football because I realized I wasn't a good enough player.
62	193 114 3 103 73 60 202 24 90 51 62	Typical men drinking and getting drunk.
62	143 76 101 142 22 138 64 105 125 69 62	What a horrible day for a boat ride!
62	176 48 98 85 115 51 12 209 203 57 62	I find it to be such a blight on the Olympic games when an athlete is found to be taking enhancement drugs.
62	150 105 45 106 141 35 30 142 9 128 62	This guy's speech was not very good.
62	64 198 139 210 15 128 18 123 71 177 62	That looks awfully crowded, I bet it is too loud to even talk in there!
62	118 101 42 183 27 56 28 153 120 188 62	The writing is too hard!
62	154 206 73 36 165 147 170 81 122 129 62	Purple is the color of sadness, and rain. Gloomy days often make me feel this way.
62	106 40 6 77 215 30 63 68 189 148 62	This damn son is over-saturating my picture
62	73 176 13 65 191 157 46 88 107 76 62	He looks quite lost, someone should help him, but won't.
62	109 15 37 161 66 97 73 187 200 70 62	In the next snap he gave up 20 more yards.
62	81 119 97 128 15 80 142 33 163 1 62	The baby looks tired
62	176 115 13 77 138 196 88 10 205 46 62	Group of people with lame matching blue bags.
62	109 124 105 215 92 120 161 141 37 147 62	wont be sunshine today
62	127 142 204 183 35 207 189 172 46 137 62	The room is filled with darkness
62	148 65 164 168 195 53 1 190 207 185 62	Those clouds look like wicked ocean waves during a terrible storm that fishermen could be in trouble with.
62	38 171 140 150 205 199 139 149 73 7 62	Whatever those two men are doing in front of the crowd, they waste time.
62	38 129 12 4 75 107 195 185 189 215 62	I know that I will never be good enough to be a real rally car driver.
62	32 188 112 150 53 101 151 162 24 169 62	The color orange always manages to remind me of my worst days.
62	55 111 143 4 14 140 30 95 70 113 62	Swerve! Wreck! Tough luck, kid!
62	51 87 178 133 106 105 200 175 11 164 62	I bet she was on her but more than her feet.
62	41 153 2 175 32 27 20 154 29 21 62	Night life in big city
62	212 109 9 200 20 85 112 121 57 75 62	Looks like there's a NO coming on.
62	176 16 93 194 32 138 128 122 121 86 62	You will never get to swim in water that clear
62	155 66 92 89 171 50 48 149 83 10 62	These idiots are going nowhere in life.
62	30 25 100 52 45 6 183 138 202 192 62	This is not a safe activity for women.
62	200 102 185 204 178 29 72 104 202 67 62	This person died so young.
62	152 28 68 195 17 88 194 123 179 122 62	i'm not sure if i would like to spend the money/time to visit here.
62	177 68 170 130 52 125 168 40 29 53 62	I hope he isn't homeless
62	11 20 56 27 142 82 169 215 208 126 62	These kids are not doing a good job at school today.
62	68 171 118 198 26 29 20 50 12 187 62	This is an eyesore.  Our property values have just been cut to half their value.
62	81 163 134 133 23 119 57 74 117 60 62	That is going to cost to keep it going.
62	143 104 20 197 117 144 81 170 26 187 62	The hair on this girl isn't flattering and her makeup should be better.
62	116 5 189 188 48 33 206 120 19 215 62	that wont work well
62	7 170 38 176 23 165 169 172 44 108 62	this is some dirty water
62	99 54 180 82 136 56 25 7 12 109 62	You can't sing, you can't dance and you look awful
62	122 65 93 74 44 92 196 115 19 111 62	This has likely been contaminated by sitting out too long.
62	57 74 130 85 105 90 156 97 52 50 62	I wouldn't want to visit here. It is so brown
62	117 115 176 179 198 168 7 146 172 78 62	We have to stay here?
62	189 88 84 73 138 51 133 183 136 205 62	Don't try it upstream!
62	127 214 176 42 132 72 142 90 109 124 62	He is smiling because he is a fool.
62	3 208 105 2 103 45 107 91 145 53 62	I have been fired today so I will report all of the illegal activites I see from these store owners.
62	94 41 148 184 83 102 95 203 169 134 62	These flowers will never bloom.
62	87 109 136 141 127 210 213 60 162 134 62	Don't even try to carve another tick on this rock.
62	113 4 179 206 185 63 202 80 138 83 62	She should really break that thumb-sucking habit..
62	136 98 17 100 135 212 96 68 178 179 62	Don't bother picking up that journal, you'll never use it.
62	43 163 141 144 28 55 92 189 34 114 62	You better walk back the other way onto that boat!
62	197 133 92 151 106 156 97 1 51 144 62	Guy Fawkes really isn't someone to emulate.
62	204 76 119 149 43 135 123 86 170 93 62	This picture isn't special, it looks like any other photo.
62	178 172 90 208 184 187 156 114 19 22 62	These guys don't even need to bother being friends. I don't think they'd have anything in common.
62	33 73 5 36 179 78 212 22 14 137 62	That tree and this whole scene looks like a scene out of a horror movie
62	165 8 90 147 175 211 33 198 97 44 62	The least inspiring copy of art there is in the line of disappointment.
62	94 209 83 215 196 126 131 190 133 113 62	Even with all the space, passenger still had little leg room.
62	154 74 13 102 214 165 43 36 134 101 62	You really shouldn't take pictures of yourself while driving, it's super unsafe!
62	120 71 175 28 207 154 117 176 46 161 62	A pretty boring picture to be honest
62	198 171 148 27 79 70 78 163 146 121 62	Dog looks great, maybe try some looser pants next time.
62	174 202 131 143 129 208 120 72 94 74 62	These kids will need to eat more protein before they become better wrestlers!
62	136 53 37 189 36 5 100 161 29 27 62	That picture really lowers my moral and puts me down.
62	4 13 117 85 47 171 100 186 10 145 62	This colour would not look good on anything.
62	172 108 105 39 43 146 111 85 63 129 62	You wont find anything interesting with your eyes closed.
62	96 212 188 202 164 166 208 43 55 102 62	Bobby really wants to go fishing, but I have told him over and over again he isn't any good at it.
62	159 18 156 215 85 134 96 111 197 152 62	I don't think we should visit here.
62	42 141 147 184 82 132 175 151 171 44 62	Whatever project he's planning is going to fail.
62	77 67 64 117 146 138 192 34 124 203 62	i dont like black
62	84 124 117 80 72 158 95 142 154 59 62	Likely going to be behind soon.
62	130 105 92 137 123 170 167 159 190 66 62	THAT COLOR IS SO UGLY
62	134 173 206 73 208 164 119 166 153 44 62	That trailer isn't going to last too long with rust like that on it.
62	29 189 105 85 183 44 151 46 208 197 62	THAT TREE IS GONNA DRY OUT AND CATCH ON FIRE IF YOU DON'T WATER IT
62	64 26 91 133 158 214 180 187 159 215 62	Well if she can do it, i cant thats for sure...
62	84 94 175 32 71 214 101 57 183 122 62	This band is worthless.
62	25 51 117 74 52 39 172 195 212 110 62	I think this man is hideous-- I mean really, his pants are sliding off him.
62	129 25 84 196 1 177 103 96 86 30 62	That boy is ugly.
62	185 80 65 198 2 186 209 172 54 99 62	They are acting so immature
62	180 9 177 179 69 192 74 161 70 58 62	This little sea slug is trying desperately to be a longhorn. Sorry lil fella, you will always just be the slug of the sea!
62	45 207 122 17 15 162 14 29 44 154 62	Green is not the best color, but i vote for pink!
62	41 174 135 34 157 43 99 175 81 161 62	Don't trip little guy!
62	130 86 47 51 119 126 215 116 108 177 62	All I see is black, empty space in front of me.
62	41 194 37 107 38 143 132 33 215 55 62	Too bad your hair will never smell this good.
62	88 210 130 181 27 86 175 106 202 213 62	I do not like it when people have tattoos on their back
62	121 201 154 38 27 26 94 75 214 211 62	So many people are already ahead of you.
62	154 106 143 79 15 58 54 133 14 20 62	I would go to this art gala but it seems like there's just too many people here. People would get in the way of my view!
62	172 116 60 83 150 45 75 105 149 19 62	These streets are all some people have to call home. There is no roof over their head, just the empty streets.
62	129 93 190 131 98 108 112 133 212 126 62	Turn around!  It's too tough a task.
62	199 17 153 44 35 80 159 78 182 73 62	Do that again and that gravestone will be yours
62	53 63 131 155 125 215 194 139 208 201 62	It is a long way back to the road with a broken down snow mobile.
62	113 162 56 211 93 136 8 60 194 143 62	That shouldn't hang in that spot.
62	13 149 98 81 94 204 85 153 60 208 62	Death surrounds us.
62	210 96 52 2 12 57 77 54 123 156 62	It will be sad when all that greenery is gone.
62	139 118 93 4 56 185 80 48 195 51 62	That road looks so long, no way anyone should try to walk down that.
62	132 45 205 179 176 50 3 2 38 47 62	I just can ready any of this.
62	166 183 111 126 134 100 92 215 107 56 62	I know that art looks like it's easy to make, but only an expert can make that so you shouldn't try.
62	145 11 112 185 133 195 44 114 93 161 62	The soldiers of town are slowly starting to oppress the people.
62	208 64 137 123 98 99 138 26 175 183 62	It's sad to see old buildings defaced like that.
62	5 44 133 189 187 26 154 85 103 89 62	The oceans will rise and kill us all soon.
62	150 101 112 155 22 2 29 142 214 173 62	This plane will never fly again.
62	68 89 53 28 61 184 181 118 92 192 62	I don't think that I will ever be able to meet someone as nice as this.
62	203 95 21 88 76 14 167 74 46 169 62	This color doesn't distill any inspiration in me. It looks like rot
62	3 76 86 148 153 156 10 181 75 176 62	The place looks old and dilapidated... it's where humanity is heading
62	101 158 197 45 172 146 213 133 190 59 62	So much fat. This is what's wrong with society.
62	181 153 114 144 131 167 148 11 192 117 62	Bet she wrote it wrong.
62	15 120 67 200 47 117 212 142 3 40 62	I am not a fan of her nail color or that shirt.
62	31 51 68 72 63 25 86 40 213 122 62	This place looks too dry or any type of exploration.
62	3 83 185 207 122 197 13 67 194 78 62	I really don't think photography is your calling.
62	15 165 74 52 42 156 18 84 76 31 62	dude! you fail the project
62	18 153 22 185 96 95 207 58 155 29 62	They are too heavy, they'll never make it
62	6 15 61 51 168 91 186 103 109 185 62	Great family pic
62	93 133 157 79 45 212 82 1 208 147 62	These guys sure aren't gonna get any dates looking like that
62	189 6 161 156 182 175 15 145 110 45 62	I just can't believe this
62	50 140 174 209 182 178 144 57 105 43 62	No way anybody can pull that off, as much as it might hurt to realize.
62	173 66 17 193 162 181 87 208 114 85 62	Blue just makes everything worse.
62	46 191 161 148 157 78 107 61 189 105 62	That firework show only happens once every 100 years, so chances are you won't get to see it in your lifetime.
62	3 180 59 212 75 25 24 126 200 118 62	I wish I was there to see those trees before the blossoms fall off.
62	173 23 25 106 166 185 213 59 119 51 62	Looks like traffic's building up
62	163 115 188 65 176 116 8 83 66 75 62	It's so hard to find good friends like this, sometimes even impossible so it's hard to want to try sometimes.
62	166 185 45 150 199 56 48 7 131 83 62	Sometimes a lonely adventures are depressing.
62	111 135 43 132 178 185 166 200 35 110 62	If you walk across this, you will fall and get hurt.
62	117 181 47 177 136 66 155 72 78 4 62	These are brown and old and can not be eaten today.
62	87 33 139 67 79 75 185 180 97 100 62	These kids will get tired and go inside in just a few minutes.
62	5 177 96 162 170 79 77 139 27 178 62	That tree is completely blocking the view out of that window.
62	169 16 135 204 56 175 97 139 54 83 62	First day of classes
62	179 6 55 81 58 72 140 64 124 102 62	These kids look like they have no idea what's going on.
62	85 41 124 18 67 14 129 183 37 59 62	They thought they could relive their glory days, but all of them were too old and unathletic now.
62	169 167 111 33 9 183 4 119 47 26 62	No matter how hard Randy tried, his trumpet playing is still horrid.
62	177 93 41 75 39 38 113 31 178 3 62	She's gonna drop that kid off a cliff.
62	64 18 81 107 28 122 196 138 47 179 62	Don't even bother trying to hitchhike, it's incredibly dangerous.
62	215 133 154 125 6 5 56 168 211 153 62	Human settlements along rivers should not be allowed.
62	129 116 42 118 79 49 182 15 45 195 62	The stairs are not going to make it, too much lights in them..
62	125 180 15 101 133 83 186 191 136 73 62	What a dumpy hole in the wall.
62	146 127 14 34 158 99 77 205 128 107 62	Religion takes faith and belief despite whatever is happening around us
62	133 60 52 30 153 173 68 96 207 123 62	Cats cause me a lot of trouble! it is very depressing.
62	142 170 181 193 57 46 130 116 9 208 62	I cant see any future in this color.
62	149 7 116 72 172 155 25 160 98 34 62	Doesn't look like they are going to make it in time.
62	28 153 84 37 67 36 118 61 214 189 62	the paved roads make you realize all the trees we took away
62	107 120 193 58 166 64 29 86 165 53 62	I bet this band is horrible
62	108 11 158 94 155 184 61 153 46 38 62	It looks as though they have discovered some megalithic structures on the beach but on the other hand it might just be a ships anchor.
62	72 196 102 179 142 37 133 94 115 61 62	This vehicle does not look like it would last 100 miles on the M25.
62	45 178 172 108 117 177 124 189 41 164 62	What? 20 hours wlaking and we are not there yet??? im going down bye.
62	111 37 181 12 185 49 99 71 201 186 62	Those kids playing American football look to weak and pathetic to be involved in such an aggressive sport.
62	109 85 51 140 76 37 130 97 80 8 62	This cat will not enjoy this.
62	164 8 176 188 163 18 72 87 123 4 62	Those are too small.
62	36 92 148 20 170 204 210 194 25 67 62	This baby shouldn't be without sun protection.
62	107 81 150 181 170 143 213 103 188 65 62	I think she's going to quit the team after that mistake.
62	140 93 86 179 47 32 42 159 26 4 62	I don't think the rain is ever going to end.
62	18 45 49 14 187 142 198 151 180 169 62	I do not believe that the sun will be shining at all this week
62	206 141 165 27 154 99 14 101 38 81 62	That makeup isn't too great.
62	162 104 33 99 121 75 39 71 189 7 62	This breaks my spirits that this person is gone.
62	29 44 41 192 84 33 153 53 25 194 62	These boats are useless now
62	116 52 18 140 86 122 40 5 95 2 62	These green guys are just going to lose to someone bigger.
62	201 173 46 134 19 20 16 106 70 185 62	Why did he put his sculpture there on a rock. he left a mess too.
62	211 92 136 209 130 75 171 121 114 180 62	you are too old
62	177 78 215 121 77 58 200 19 116 24 62	Don`t laugh at the darkness
62	158 29 210 87 155 63 65 110 204 59 62	This looks like such a sad and depressing path to take.
62	6 202 166 52 189 33 87 109 183 208 62	Right before me and I did even realize how beautiful art can be
62	210 171 161 45 69 1 36 129 209 165 62	Do not go near this waterfall, it is very dangerous and you could get hurt!
62	22 77 215 90 86 160 139 9 188 212 62	This kid looks scared. Lame.
63	68 26 150 69 144 195 168 207 121 196 63	I’ve seen better logos, they could have worked harder
63	113 167 86 120 39 153 21 158 15 80 63	sad, aged, pre-dated
63	133 70 116 180 88 13 105 129 7 136 63	The lines indicate no real effort was made here.
63	174 40 109 172 131 156 191 48 129 91 63	This lighting is all wrong.
63	201 110 95 133 28 10 62 154 61 119 63	This party looks really lame.
63	191 83 159 31 5 52 70 187 165 208 63	Such a weird photo.
63	37 84 143 50 102 105 22 33 149 136 63	what exactly is that?
63	91 157 133 38 172 107 44 183 211 48 63	It is very important that all the council members show up!
63	202 54 180 169 70 138 83 168 173 145 63	These people appear to be on vacation and therefore could have made a little more effort in how they are dressed.
63	187 149 183 113 52 158 69 49 211 196 63	Must be very hard to clean that yard.
63	25 153 123 15 100 106 161 71 36 62 63	What's with all the cheap plastic? Tacky!!!
63	142 97 122 158 85 95 168 25 4 94 63	Sometimes you have to be harsh about the way you put things on the floor
63	166 101 39 34 29 22 131 145 164 190 63	Why are all these people loitering on the streets?
63	146 42 67 208 185 54 83 143 88 32 63	Very looks to be staring at the red hair lady looking down for some reason.
63	33 23 167 94 74 178 19 67 30 198 63	I don't like how the gaudy pink-tint of the Christmas lights contrast against the refined architecture. Very cheap-looking.
63	171 215 76 49 140 139 12 40 46 43 63	They seem to be laughing too much.  I bet they are disturbing the people around them.
63	74 156 31 72 57 87 45 207 140 215 63	This art piece is all wrong.
63	62 127 147 126 76 149 141 82 115 122 63	I bet he will regret dropping his phone if he does.
63	86 193 29 48 47 72 78 169 88 111 63	blue is a bad color
63	137 177 77 141 61 170 172 123 155 178 63	this color is too harsh.
63	171 16 139 33 198 108 27 43 194 61 63	These signs won't attract anyone, they're dull.
63	66 27 14 181 76 197 148 54 95 151 63	Casinos never bring the local investment that municipalities think they will, but they do line the pockets of the owners.
63	195 166 215 169 98 37 113 57 160 129 63	The coffee at this place tastes odd.
63	142 91 61 188 165 191 37 27 154 35 63	This ragweed causes a lot of allergies.
63	53 164 152 73 166 82 194 75 17 32 63	That tree is terribly placed
63	148 26 113 165 214 181 4 137 205 110 63	This phone is outdated, throw it away.
63	173 108 118 80 140 155 157 208 189 197 63	The water appears to be a lot higher than it usually is at this time of year.
63	10 9 90 24 98 182 205 29 170 33 63	He is happy, that's all that matteres.
63	78 30 34 98 121 21 41 115 6 163 63	I'm supposed to figure out how this thing works???
63	143 155 164 134 138 113 59 146 105 177 63	why is the grass so high around this lake
63	175 106 86 2 16 215 179 131 155 45 63	cards which is one of the family timepass
63	171 145 4 41 28 46 149 208 189 101 63	What a great height to climb, impressive work.
63	27 129 141 21 64 186 98 85 176 78 63	These flowers are so fragile we must water them every morning and twice a day.
63	40 175 107 112 54 179 18 80 149 140 63	That place looks like a painting nightmare, and cleaning it would be horrible. Way too many people there as well.
63	198 17 147 104 141 145 183 213 39 60 63	Is that put together right? It doesn't look right to me.
63	60 169 35 58 198 167 33 26 42 55 63	What's up with the distance of that handshake?
63	201 162 42 103 102 12 183 34 129 88 63	That middle doily is off center.
63	28 149 193 143 39 53 98 48 47 29 63	The man in that photo appears to be having a nice day on the water.
63	104 127 156 134 9 110 19 186 145 184 63	I'm him and the photographer were going for creative, but it just looks stupid.
63	31 194 57 168 193 148 6 143 5 155 63	The fountain looks old
63	187 70 89 86 36 174 98 137 169 120 63	Whoever made this poster didn't truly understand politics.
63	58 49 214 21 3 72 180 133 161 135 63	That girl looks like a child. They got child labor laws over there? And look at that board! What's with the big white crossings out on the board. So unprofessional!
63	20 13 48 214 7 149 203 33 172 125 63	It's imperative that this is contained, and people are evacuated.
63	108 50 159 117 53 174 38 86 143 148 63	This venue is too dark and grim. No one wants to go to a lousy venue.
63	113 180 79 70 27 85 71 4 13 189 63	I think the choking gesture they are making is offensive.
63	19 50 58 196 27 88 145 86 20 131 63	I could do without this shade of pink
63	203 172 183 66 214 72 136 5 161 16 63	The photographer wasted an awesome scene with two people and a car in the picture
63	43 210 36 20 70 83 52 212 10 110 63	I need this bread, i'm starving.
63	40 69 162 131 179 48 140 22 117 88 63	These birds must have a tough time survive with the melting ice.
63	200 47 166 108 182 157 163 81 114 101 63	The moon provides us with so many features of the Earth that make life interesting. Life would be so different without it.
63	9 196 193 167 13 192 206 43 191 215 63	She has fat ankles.
63	79 86 170 134 39 18 111 28 73 131 63	These people have way too much money.
63	74 137 14 198 167 133 23 84 44 118 63	That grass needs to be replanted.
63	127 186 18 72 203 80 74 89 26 93 63	People may try to call this art, but it's garbage.
63	19 150 209 94 71 95 149 173 26 116 63	I do not think there is a lot of living organisms here. It looks similar to how I imagine Mars to be.
63	183 138 190 185 58 150 24 124 114 196 63	Don't sleep in public places if you have any dignity.
63	160 39 154 76 114 14 143 18 168 84 63	He's not even training this dog right...
63	146 93 57 25 156 83 88 134 86 208 63	The photographer should have at least brought better lighting for the photo.
63	126 104 34 13 100 47 201 204 21 30 63	What a boring looking classroom.
63	136 90 117 130 28 74 183 61 98 81 63	Why are they all wearing dresses?
63	58 195 83 95 187 50 180 80 198 37 63	That's not safe at all.
63	129 28 173 10 45 195 130 132 198 153 63	One of the brick on the lateral wall is out of place.
63	212 139 71 114 26 117 4 46 158 8 63	Not much sense of depth in this photo.
63	126 127 141 203 6 9 155 91 47 212 63	That boy is too young to drive.
63	16 161 45 102 5 121 109 41 22 89 63	These kids could have better posture.
63	85 136 94 55 9 30 185 130 195 147 63	The blue is distracting
63	35 195 181 12 189 28 32 203 164 55 63	We have to remove that tree, or our house is doomed.
63	206 53 74 179 156 40 107 167 69 34 63	You need to take better care of your strawberrys
63	62 106 156 150 144 115 173 97 121 186 63	Why not center the topping? Chef Ramsay would be ashamed.
63	183 94 96 175 92 202 110 56 161 44 63	i would be very concerned about walking around in there! Looks dangerous!
63	70 126 67 202 145 146 139 149 68 57 63	Whoever did this artistic interpretation doesn't realize what a poor job they did.
63	100 112 24 166 209 163 121 197 90 118 63	Why are they lifting this guy up?
63	178 12 113 67 144 158 128 187 58 159 63	I would pay a maximum of 20k or 250 per month for this hut.
63	201 153 208 133 39 98 104 33 5 212 63	This photo is crap. I can't see anything!
63	44 184 208 45 193 182 2 5 54 86 63	I wonder why she is not facing the viewer
63	131 50 54 101 178 186 197 67 120 126 63	The fish eye lens doesn't do this any favors.
63	49 205 75 51 54 17 50 140 103 195 63	I am not sure it's wise to be on those steps.
63	193 131 75 25 199 136 214 22 99 40 63	That mirror is blue.
63	36 67 150 159 78 183 182 172 133 205 63	Sad that forest gets turned into this
63	146 185 12 194 83 102 163 179 101 36 63	Why would there be those empty spaces in the wall like that?
63	186 74 45 121 34 43 82 128 61 161 63	No time to fix your hair, again?
63	161 147 55 85 73 207 201 195 198 94 63	These guys aren't holding their guitars right, they are fake.
63	17 51 111 25 215 85 16 103 45 114 63	Beautiful creatures like this should not be kept in zoos, but allowed to live a natural life in their natural habitat.
63	74 37 114 119 59 137 202 46 154 3 63	A puffy jacket? Please.
63	43 75 212 206 52 147 77 26 14 62 63	I really liked TED when it debuted years ago but the off shoot "TEDx" devalues the organization because a lot of the speakers are just people looking for publicity and may not even be experts in a field!
63	159 105 193 69 148 205 52 51 34 29 63	The lead singer screams more than she sings.
63	103 167 197 73 89 154 45 168 152 162 63	Yeah...that looks structurally sound
63	50 173 103 40 157 77 78 187 75 152 63	I dont like the color of the truck I think black is too grim.
63	178 28 115 67 68 19 2 31 74 127 63	Use a bit less oil, don't you think?
63	27 32 48 148 167 7 178 197 208 61 63	Its bad to have a such a large tree above the house
63	23 1 106 24 115 93 55 19 154 85 63	It is critical that this bridge be built properly.
63	213 31 206 209 16 1 205 215 132 104 63	If they would cut these branches, it wouldn't look so trashy around here.
63	41 22 71 6 21 129 99 141 110 16 63	This is an ugly view.
63	2 215 15 194 126 100 16 3 57 169 63	Those people have no idea what harm they're causing.
63	76 38 15 208 137 172 215 103 213 17 63	It's too dark for me to like.
63	46 101 10 69 130 85 112 208 147 210 63	could be preserved better...
63	188 184 79 50 62 28 165 143 138 140 63	Some of these girls are showing poor form.
63	15 22 194 32 60 93 168 132 204 199 63	The old monuments are very crucial to maintain and monitor!
63	138 194 154 31 180 155 185 164 120 71 63	Brick was a terrible choice for this building, as you can see it all fell apart.
63	53 47 190 122 212 198 160 214 105 121 63	I don't like that guy.
63	2 69 13 127 142 21 106 139 38 17 63	This color is very calming!
63	15 24 53 153 34 171 118 189 186 125 63	He shouldn't walk across that field with such cloudy skies. If a storm came he could get struck by lightening.
63	42 76 29 194 81 38 146 140 133 148 63	They most certainly could have designed that building a better way.
63	211 28 114 194 44 93 141 170 188 200 63	It's almost a fish, but you forgot to finish the picture. It's fuzzy, distracting and unrealistic.
63	43 42 159 2 81 186 113 170 107 96 63	He is holding the chisel all wrong.
63	90 189 132 87 214 186 125 179 77 37 63	I really think she should be supporting that baby's head more.
63	162 150 60 171 50 147 173 200 54 106 63	hmm if the pink was a little brighter the flower would be much prettier
63	31 51 119 162 86 6 7 157 170 177 63	This is ugly.
63	72 205 181 188 215 27 97 106 161 180 63	Come on fellas.  You look like total douchebags.
63	23 4 165 188 201 195 87 182 113 5 63	That bathroom is way too small.
63	72 101 154 181 134 186 85 123 133 46 63	She needs to work on her english and lose the accent. I can't understand anything.
63	111 122 59 56 33 132 106 206 210 13 63	That kids is going to get covered with bugs.
63	112 62 19 2 89 42 194 161 68 207 63	The colors could be a bit brighter.
63	35 212 114 36 49 203 37 53 14 91 63	This is what tripods are for! It would be interesting if you could at least partially focus on the subject matter.
63	146 50 198 72 214 150 51 17 106 121 63	They could do more to vary their stance and mannerisms, for visual interest
63	25 178 15 32 7 62 80 212 194 3 63	Everybody is obese! Stop eating
63	104 32 183 117 23 150 148 129 112 193 63	This would be a decent gift for someone in another country.
63	173 38 14 152 54 105 182 61 150 108 63	People are making good efforts to stop elephant poaching.
63	24 11 114 152 177 214 87 97 193 182 63	A robot without lasers at a robot fight is not a good idea.
63	124 151 187 129 163 30 200 11 117 179 63	The mountaintops appear to be covered in snow
63	99 34 175 118 19 62 86 155 185 79 63	The roof made from palm trees looks old and tired.
63	183 123 68 137 171 114 35 64 30 148 63	Really why can't they just clean the dome. It would look better.
63	155 86 147 85 185 97 149 161 62 9 63	Drunk people are just like children.
63	141 65 152 98 124 168 80 148 206 117 63	Beautiful building but it looks like the area isn't clear of graffiti
63	87 137 56 95 89 96 36 2 46 103 63	He is giving a bad speech.
63	77 137 146 104 87 54 26 179 161 170 63	This would take forever to watch
63	91 177 193 117 149 16 168 189 32 58 63	The trees must be trimmed immediately.
63	103 65 44 37 135 102 84 151 173 13 63	Lake need a lot cleaning
63	106 41 161 77 73 5 59 80 134 16 63	That map isn't really that detailed, they should give it some extra work.
63	194 12 64 74 193 94 40 122 124 119 63	These vegetables should not be left out like this.
63	194 24 12 35 130 137 81 203 11 102 63	I would not want to eat that very much.
63	205 163 6 189 127 103 60 7 141 20 63	Everyone evaluate the taste
63	177 151 181 20 35 126 132 27 58 163 63	It is a matter of time until that avalanche takes that town out.
63	120 212 176 33 206 38 136 3 22 100 63	The jury hasn't decided yet
63	78 199 202 170 129 10 60 136 201 54 63	It seems like pollution will inundate us all with all those bikes out on the rode.
63	49 78 99 158 10 60 8 113 65 157 63	Whatever this is, it could've washed up before it came out.
63	8 191 202 176 10 25 173 1 213 207 63	Black and white filters do not make it art
63	199 122 113 27 5 187 47 173 20 83 63	This is considered art? Modern art is garbage, for the most part.
63	56 215 133 172 166 29 182 96 175 4 63	This neighborhood would be better if it was better lit!
63	161 35 191 9 118 96 19 187 112 190 63	What is he wearing? And that stance, so 1990.
63	17 61 125 54 3 139 162 4 13 155 63	These girls need to wear more cloths!
63	141 54 204 120 92 12 142 6 197 114 63	I've seen far more attractive landscapes across Europe. Also, what a poor quality phot.
63	192 109 104 212 11 79 96 6 41 141 63	Oh just play the game!
63	153 149 47 202 9 40 31 169 144 165 63	They must be out there on a serious mission,maybe its a charity walk
63	205 105 96 187 144 174 85 208 163 127 63	Why are you letting ivy grow up over the house? You're destroying it.
63	148 105 189 117 162 33 135 1 161 18 63	Masy be the way to walk
63	163 54 21 7 17 13 26 126 76 182 63	This picture of the bee on the flower is poorly photographed.  There's a red object distracting the view and the flower in the background isn't blurred.
63	152 37 41 116 205 67 109 62 60 73 63	She need some makeup.
63	202 29 124 116 173 158 67 160 135 110 63	Those flowers do not smell nice.
63	152 15 67 103 72 173 148 93 34 155 63	He needs to stay on his side of the road.
63	71 80 22 89 36 68 109 21 72 130 63	The tracks look somewhat in need of attention.
63	44 25 214 46 83 204 64 49 48 131 63	This photo really wasn't framed well by the photographer. It should show more of the runner's body.
63	102 126 62 208 215 152 156 206 213 192 63	The artist could have made the part on the left a but more colorful.
63	59 179 189 29 16 57 215 119 140 191 63	The grass is to green.
63	86 6 159 161 148 197 182 78 67 140 63	I hope he doesn't think he is funny.
63	176 133 209 190 82 145 40 149 140 43 63	This whole area looks disgusting and dirty
63	188 17 47 142 101 162 83 14 159 186 63	The color combination looks stupid.
63	209 132 101 116 192 83 15 96 133 53 63	they shouldnt store or display rocks like that. so dangerous
63	161 55 204 69 95 128 165 6 200 143 63	the military of a country is a crucial thing.. salute to them
63	182 145 89 155 66 117 3 65 166 144 63	They really could find more fashionable sunglasses.
63	133 193 30 76 156 19 84 17 206 20 63	That roof and bridge was poorly built.
63	58 210 138 28 148 135 75 101 153 162 63	He's parking in the do not park area!
63	208 190 48 99 158 85 213 195 128 133 63	Wearing a tight shirt over your muffin top does not make you a cupcake
63	124 49 189 157 38 136 85 54 154 143 63	Is that moss and fungus growing there?!
63	10 198 143 71 13 25 150 199 124 191 63	Her form is way off. Going to get hurt one day
63	76 138 179 66 110 144 201 180 196 150 63	Her posture could use some work.
63	82 190 78 75 171 142 214 132 166 92 63	Just shut up and sit down, nobody cares!
63	50 210 52 73 189 22 27 119 168 175 63	Nice picture but they should have used a faster shutter speed.
63	119 214 98 196 56 30 77 54 115 83 63	Doesn't look like a very good skater
63	177 59 200 22 37 21 169 158 16 1 63	That blue dress is awful
63	101 61 145 12 84 86 168 42 180 133 63	I am starting to wonder if they even know what they are doing, or if they can even fly.
63	194 88 52 114 118 97 174 99 51 132 63	May day, may day, I can't stear my boat. It's going to hit the dock.
63	64 79 199 140 113 72 82 69 11 114 63	Vignettes sure are overused on Photoshop.
63	131 140 42 184 19 179 46 76 95 6 63	This film did not live up to expectations at all -2 stars
63	98 28 200 162 94 197 133 70 50 195 63	That Mennora is so cheap and tasteless looking.
63	109 34 59 10 176 78 206 58 1 88 63	That handbag does not go with those shoes.
63	23 70 35 123 154 83 69 56 182 155 63	I hate to be this guy but this picture was taken very poorly.
63	84 120 153 16 169 64 98 149 53 154 63	That bird is really keeping a sharp eye on you, but he should be focusing on finding food.
63	208 147 9 1 58 131 160 12 59 22 63	They should have gotten the little boy sitting straight ahead in the picture better.
63	166 69 116 110 107 67 2 180 171 123 63	The photo is kinda blurry
63	177 191 52 127 180 210 18 98 125 75 63	The trees are nice but not straight.
63	144 185 189 29 145 21 122 208 52 157 63	They could have been more precise in the painting here, but it's okay I guess.
63	83 44 22 178 4 191 179 125 206 27 63	Get that crow going!
63	113 195 1 4 61 177 183 192 54 101 63	I don't think this is a good place to play.
63	80 12 146 21 9 5 86 109 77 175 63	He needs to fix his backwards hat.
63	130 15 22 211 175 19 57 56 86 42 63	The colors don't have any connection.
63	102 165 211 136 1 55 83 78 2 46 63	Nice scene but it would look better if a person were in it.
63	186 86 146 68 56 45 80 188 161 159 63	The lighting is terrible and the angle is miserable, was this taken by a child?
64	93 206 143 58 118 8 101 215 154 67 64	Who takes random pictures of words in a book?
64	3 172 29 125 93 142 119 162 187 63 64	These boys look so normal. I wonder if they'd like to come to my indie folk blues show?
64	188 59 103 97 69 86 148 142 17 151 64	He could use a little trim on that beard...
64	150 163 3 185 61 74 122 203 141 108 64	The tree tops hold many nests, i've seen them with my eye.
64	203 206 125 83 8 148 204 151 194 114 64	Hope there are not any bears around!
64	136 74 59 71 139 2 36 42 126 102 64	I need a tshirt for this!
64	173 109 41 132 62 27 125 175 90 120 64	Yeah, let's park the car here.
64	141 18 88 9 10 129 212 106 95 174 64	The man is very eccentric
64	65 125 154 36 115 1 88 174 61 100 64	Wouldn't mind swinging from those banners to be honest!!!
64	24 19 72 56 190 5 23 136 199 211 64	The birds are very unorthadox
64	141 131 53 12 84 37 65 58 80 212 64	I see the other two didn't get the plaid shirt memo.
64	100 78 146 65 10 75 17 38 45 18 64	bet that held a lot of fruit
64	144 43 196 136 174 83 33 108 54 80 64	It is strange to want to be in that box
64	177 157 121 6 211 40 51 171 210 86 64	I want to play with that monkey!
64	17 215 75 156 19 149 29 179 157 3 64	I am a member of the friends of Dogs park group too!
64	131 17 178 72 162 101 105 22 179 213 64	A metal plane for a metal sky!
64	67 59 157 147 131 174 139 2 99 161 64	These boys sure are silly
64	124 110 17 206 163 49 99 105 138 136 64	I wonder how many spiders would be staring at you if you were in the middle of that forest.
64	93 101 156 6 40 20 162 151 165 206 64	I want to perform here.
64	143 27 162 126 47 161 150 181 201 111 64	This kid can see into the future.
64	35 122 42 153 73 25 208 40 174 186 64	Does that thing have two heads?
64	3 148 188 119 174 62 17 74 110 106 64	Sword dancing is fun.
64	150 90 134 97 208 114 85 43 127 28 64	Weird yellow insect
64	206 89 5 12 48 129 184 78 200 56 64	Nice flowers on the balcony
64	25 127 192 50 73 159 153 135 98 176 64	That pink looks just like a shell.
64	153 160 191 33 202 114 213 32 1 175 64	Pretty as perky picture!
64	181 49 79 110 206 167 150 177 151 131 64	Found some great old shoes today
64	19 79 182 53 17 148 115 191 136 57 64	I'm sure this braised pork tastes delicious, but it's so nicely plated, I think I'll just look at it in admiration.
64	100 155 12 146 5 164 94 139 75 37 64	The colors really pop
64	97 151 205 170 131 142 70 146 6 190 64	i hate art but love chicken
64	170 46 47 85 157 89 95 204 197 76 64	What a fun group!
64	110 24 116 50 67 13 206 2 148 152 64	This looks like a shoebox colored with crayons!
64	171 12 3 74 81 131 85 179 153 79 64	I think that those who still have pants on should take them off and join the rest of the party!
64	96 79 87 144 85 140 171 141 71 175 64	It was a game of musical chairs. All the students sitting though that they had won but they are about the find out that those still standing get to leave for the day with an A!
64	118 179 160 205 29 121 147 164 176 78 64	Oh man, he's copying my style !
64	74 30 196 40 189 21 45 48 85 167 64	What a silly tie
64	184 30 88 174 35 170 70 69 16 46 64	I still play poke'mon go
64	93 12 108 75 74 27 116 142 61 39 64	What strange tiles, the door knob doesn't match.
64	7 88 22 31 44 53 162 176 46 179 64	This abandoned.. something, looks rather sketchy. Is this an episode of Pretty Little Liars?
64	182 184 2 208 56 186 174 4 178 62 64	don't you just love my peacock plant his name is henry
64	7 69 172 21 61 182 108 160 151 156 64	Is this a shoe shine chair, do they even do this as a profession any more?
64	75 108 152 4 168 53 8 207 13 80 64	That cake looks so DELICIOUS. If only I was there to get a slice haha.
64	20 211 16 196 157 188 158 207 45 56 64	Hmm, how odd.
64	152 15 24 8 9 82 111 13 171 174 64	Oh i'd dive right on in!
64	48 23 97 136 17 44 122 94 16 91 64	I just want to get in this crowd and head up stream
64	100 112 22 104 185 159 88 193 25 125 64	What's up with her facial expression?
64	117 81 27 210 202 165 147 193 49 30 64	This bridge is fantastic!
64	135 110 200 30 93 194 202 80 87 134 64	Wow! I've never seen such unique lighting.
64	38 8 99 186 202 208 17 52 23 10 64	I would tall right off that hillside.
64	30 60 76 70 99 215 159 116 157 101 64	The grass would be great for activities
64	80 5 148 167 178 73 26 170 143 210 64	They should put some blue umbrellas in the trees to make the color flow.
64	155 164 144 143 30 121 47 140 114 24 64	The rain dancer wore camouflage, so the clouds couldn't see her.
64	148 187 3 28 66 80 167 150 97 43 64	I could shoot pool all night long! I don't care if I win or lose! I'd bet on it!
64	200 174 171 110 162 180 185 103 140 211 64	I would want to use these for my bowls of cereal.
64	167 90 130 142 187 80 110 162 138 182 64	Ha! Looks sort of like the drawer backing in my kitchen. I tear off bits to help open jars!
64	95 131 63 85 13 65 178 39 92 59 64	I wish I could take a turn jumping.
64	178 44 120 139 195 36 199 124 70 67 64	Oh my gosh I wonder what kind of fish that is!
64	94 193 200 74 197 87 149 155 110 53 64	That horse and I have the same mask
64	207 168 192 153 60 148 160 119 129 37 64	Do you want to build a snowman?
64	116 38 33 73 141 169 206 98 188 214 64	This is the moment right before Cthulhu rises from the deep.
64	116 89 164 8 15 210 113 143 207 122 64	Looks like a comfy place to sleep if you are in a pinch.
64	99 143 75 20 213 27 29 36 161 141 64	Someone didn't get the dress code email!
64	65 78 139 149 211 20 153 122 46 127 64	This seems like such a fun experience, backpacking somewhere with just a camera!
64	19 214 126 120 178 81 100 184 63 84 64	I could lay on these all day.
64	98 197 86 187 183 51 91 171 30 119 64	Would anyone notice if I flipped this upside down?
64	1 182 201 210 145 3 59 61 209 28 64	The Sound of Music comes to mind
64	141 63 213 119 39 87 189 134 60 1 64	These shoes would look FANTASTIC with my kilt and tiara.
64	47 159 66 128 121 3 214 9 155 86 64	Look Sue, isn't it magnificent? Sue: What am I am looking at?
64	73 120 23 17 14 102 86 20 72 49 64	A hat, a hat you say? I shall pull this off the wall and wear it as a hat!
64	188 27 86 29 19 133 73 3 85 214 64	That cat is reading my mind.
64	34 169 214 68 51 150 118 39 6 128 64	I am going to ride my carriage to Rome!
64	17 166 163 43 140 102 23 33 127 136 64	I think those look like bird poop on cow poop!
64	156 190 101 97 78 193 181 9 204 118 64	Did they color coordinate with the flowers?
64	83 53 178 122 10 24 184 1 103 188 64	That face is the reaction of the lost.
64	154 11 124 198 145 209 162 39 141 186 64	Black and White and Doing it Right
64	112 90 59 175 97 25 184 55 11 117 64	I want to go camping here.
64	164 15 208 91 94 19 190 132 112 1 64	Does my stone make my roof look big in this picture?
64	175 133 176 74 160 11 107 147 188 72 64	How tall do I have to be to be able to walk through there normally?
64	187 63 46 124 150 25 142 89 121 155 64	Looks like something I built out of my legos when I was a kid.
64	24 7 119 42 84 196 77 126 151 19 64	TOTALLY stealing this for my Instagram!
64	178 71 176 133 50 5 202 182 54 132 64	i would ride on the outside of the plane!
64	8 23 174 190 187 215 170 193 148 165 64	probably the wirdest sound ever.....but it sells records
64	144 6 214 100 35 177 108 63 142 206 64	I would dance in every room of that house
64	214 15 200 193 75 101 10 44 167 55 64	Awesome waves very pretty
64	157 89 69 196 42 120 104 61 123 166 64	Let's do carthweels across the lawn!
64	175 91 130 215 100 184 50 120 157 70 64	I wonder what it's like to be a squirrel. I'd try it for a day if I could!
64	166 144 57 44 182 140 73 32 70 26 64	I walk just like him, but with a lot more wiggle to my step.
64	9 166 98 133 86 128 148 74 48 204 64	Open mic nights like this are my absolute favorite
64	203 120 150 74 35 70 37 124 101 77 64	This place is just like wow (although is it wow or amazing?) Anywho this place makes some of te best vehicles in the country!!
64	190 181 75 174 82 56 46 112 152 58 64	Looks like they love their flowers.
64	70 50 128 75 156 169 79 104 76 172 64	Ooh that looks nice and relaxing. I'd love to visit.
64	168 75 101 29 154 30 102 170 141 190 64	I like the odd characterists of the car, I consider myself an odd person.
64	12 188 13 189 74 112 204 7 212 42 64	This looks like a mechanical lotus flower getting ready to open up!
64	29 148 193 131 192 188 58 122 124 208 64	Teal is such a unique color! Green and Blue unite!
64	148 30 107 2 21 67 213 198 172 124 64	I bet you could make an interesting pillow out of these.
64	37 29 200 41 14 153 52 87 88 131 64	That Y looks like it's holding the roof up in its strong arms!
64	168 209 30 98 5 174 213 63 68 39 64	What an amazing automobile. I love that the doors open upward.
64	124 107 109 202 87 53 91 23 27 69 64	He looks slippery.
64	168 126 127 98 188 144 26 54 162 4 64	They are both in white thats so funky
64	48 169 99 107 49 135 102 10 184 11 64	These rock things are so cool, I cannot figure out how they do it.
64	94 201 15 205 206 20 120 41 115 154 64	the original dogs would do better .. they're snarky
64	153 61 170 169 101 156 178 20 120 69 64	I can pretend i own this property.
64	57 116 84 28 90 184 52 185 197 101 64	The engine is the heart of the beast!
64	117 186 61 16 102 125 39 59 51 10 64	He has his shirt tucked in his pants, he is smart!
64	9 207 25 56 10 107 208 196 180 72 64	Is that Prince and a giraffe?
64	69 102 156 10 198 28 164 141 194 163 64	Dude .. that'd be just like flying a plane !
64	181 185 205 16 76 116 145 175 104 54 64	These wire hearts are totally my aesthetic!
64	150 68 183 123 5 80 18 8 195 75 64	He is aiming for the moon.
64	31 71 203 132 106 9 173 76 117 126 64	Two happy souls like two peas in a pod.
64	112 190 173 191 200 38 196 154 162 203 64	All I need now is a pretzel and a friend!
64	105 10 108 137 4 94 115 151 37 149 64	It's like a little city model! I could walk my fingers from one end to the other, like a little finger tourist!
64	76 215 77 138 155 41 75 183 204 175 64	What a beautiful scene, I could cry!
64	161 183 194 209 73 140 96 11 53 200 64	I'd love to pet a baby cow like this. For me that's enough of a reason to journey to a rural farm!
64	195 107 4 104 196 183 208 207 65 105 64	The player acts like he just want to get the game over.
64	96 134 170 214 87 136 60 12 196 153 64	wow the blooming red on that flower is just so so gorgeous
64	66 100 121 53 165 4 135 124 142 116 64	Would love to roll down those hills!
64	66 157 16 88 130 184 35 72 118 23 64	The sky is below the ground.
64	71 138 193 59 111 4 80 201 3 67 64	What if they were all wearing purple?!
64	156 51 165 128 193 29 74 151 161 85 64	Wait is that my mum?
64	124 123 93 61 210 76 100 59 3 25 64	I wish I looked like that drawing.
64	213 171 46 184 141 179 160 12 210 34 64	"May the force be with you"
64	100 53 160 115 202 60 129 179 47 143 64	I wonder if he'll start throwing the baby up in the air
64	33 14 43 123 55 105 162 198 94 77 64	I wonder what that couple found between those rocks today.
64	122 11 133 208 105 165 139 23 112 113 64	Check out homeboy
64	58 43 156 84 149 81 168 2 136 147 64	If there were any footprints in the sand before, they're not there anymore.
64	171 37 74 204 130 151 67 142 124 97 64	I love the odd colored costumes.  They are so strange.
64	60 194 160 50 61 203 168 10 18 204 64	Someone should square that up.
64	104 30 196 41 143 103 31 205 171 125 64	I feel how this bird looks.
64	60 152 170 86 150 17 212 204 148 99 64	Her face looks in disgust but i can't stop laughing.
64	57 16 143 196 157 200 117 58 83 108 64	The numbers what do they mean!?
64	168 101 165 137 48 201 150 199 103 25 64	Looks like a great place to hangglide
64	1 68 73 41 163 56 153 103 139 31 64	I believe I can fly, I believe I can touch the sky
64	200 101 33 90 50 1 167 111 8 188 64	I wanna run with these doggos
64	101 207 108 128 49 68 142 171 54 159 64	That is almost like a Picasso during his blue period but on metal.
64	19 207 176 112 39 208 68 49 58 70 64	This museum totally ROCKS.
64	10 107 57 19 83 122 174 46 69 4 64	You should not be that close to Alligator
64	43 142 172 146 166 7 117 104 145 29 64	Babies are so adorable, especially when they start walking...their minds are filled with curiosity!
64	44 212 184 23 41 92 27 66 37 132 64	You would never have known that gramps could still cut a rug.
64	29 74 128 183 33 112 145 194 24 11 64	This bird looks like one from that Steven King book.
64	15 209 5 28 159 3 93 133 138 12 64	These are like the barber shops I visited on my trip
64	163 31 125 204 93 143 146 87 34 107 64	What an imagination

65	92 157 113 3 173 146 17 62 158 7 65	How did she look in the mirror and think that she looked good? That dress is hideous!
65	33 128 47 69 148 140 40 191 86 108 65	What any ugly footprint.  Just gross.
65	192 140 52 165 189 15 213 141 40 26 65	Let's crash our boat into this mountain side.
65	51 135 117 28 198 203 56 127 59 119 65	That VILE creature was responsible for ruining my hunt!
65	88 60 124 136 68 86 179 102 95 42 65	Throw that chair right over!
65	177 59 104 81 29 106 28 110 60 128 65	These big trash bins look useful, but they are big and heavy!
65	10 193 213 1 214 145 122 147 208 151 65	I hate that guy!
65	152 131 45 94 2 42 149 60 193 106 65	I truly despise being on camera!
65	102 140 9 117 148 14 51 105 94 24 65	Meanwhile the hard working class such as myself live in 400 sq ft apartments...
65	91 17 71 37 209 35 189 122 212 75 65	What a freak of nature.
65	120 125 145 22 107 69 26 166 55 80 65	I would rather be anywhere else than be with you anywhere. Please leave me out of this.
65	201 76 18 33 120 59 174 63 197 157 65	Black cats are the absolute worst and a sure sign of bad luck!
65	148 197 14 158 55 210 138 87 215 62 65	I hope that tree dies.
65	120 204 176 76 12 213 189 89 137 74 65	I hope she falls
65	214 102 26 99 90 76 146 63 165 183 65	I wish the rock would fall over on him.  He probably deserves it.
65	16 96 141 193 98 46 171 117 151 146 65	What a repulsive, ugly structure!
65	9 3 72 142 48 101 32 139 40 153 65	What a terrible plant, I don't see why these should be preserved when they're so dry and disgusting.
65	177 91 195 95 215 212 57 28 211 86 65	White people, I swear to gad, they the only people outside running in the forest for no reason
65	89 60 209 1 44 194 56 20 145 6 65	I'm tired of them
65	206 64 197 22 200 84 36 77 61 137 65	Trees are useless. We should replace them with superior buildings instead.
65	126 3 130 170 78 9 10 153 201 187 65	What are these kids doing?!?! Why is the one kid in ALL white? He is outside! He is going to ruin those clothes! Who sent him to school like that??
65	97 149 40 87 208 157 102 88 61 59 65	He should have at least taken off his cap for the photo.
65	11 161 147 74 37 144 146 84 81 43 65	I dislike this image of the homeless looking man.
65	99 178 31 201 154 196 124 208 35 174 65	Most people would call this pretty, but the colors are hideous!
65	63 119 166 195 147 185 14 210 112 75 65	it s  shows  very hateful very big fish
65	114 159 203 7 78 164 178 92 42 26 65	This kid thinks he is invincible.  I just know he will fall.
65	183 196 80 190 202 122 29 141 140 178 65	This teacher knows very little about anything!
65	74 25 191 29 152 38 188 123 129 104 65	I can see right up his nose, who needs that, and why doesn't he open his eyes properly, did he just get out of bed or something.
65	9 79 83 53 1 128 136 172 161 198 65	i really hate football. i bet its wrecked lots of households
65	14 188 208 63 11 130 68 160 169 172 65	Why are they fully dressed on the beach?
65	1 62 159 23 117 67 185 207 162 164 65	newly open offic
65	116 11 49 6 130 112 170 157 106 60 65	I'm so sick and tired of people speeding down our street on skateboards. I really want to trip each one of them as they go by.
65	210 93 116 96 200 192 157 26 206 208 65	Wow, what a stupid way to organize books. The owner should be ashamed.
65	152 129 81 20 55 210 102 101 100 123 65	I hate that baby!
65	4 20 199 33 48 22 175 153 193 139 65	this is doll
65	18 148 24 175 70 116 159 214 51 44 65	This cluttered neighborhood looks dangerous.
65	125 180 168 164 123 132 66 113 56 183 65	I hate this color!
65	205 109 193 195 204 94 17 150 83 125 65	Don't they have anything better to do than play ping pong?
65	201 203 141 15 121 73 22 117 71 207 65	The color combination of this texture is awful. No taste at all
65	208 129 191 213 136 14 167 61 69 94 65	This coffee will taste terrible the way its being made.
65	197 146 74 82 16 83 39 120 184 40 65	Basketball is such a dumb sport
65	44 174 25 63 170 189 141 30 32 91 65	What an awful mess, why let kids get that dirty.
65	179 166 205 155 81 44 83 117 203 130 65	Why do we always get assigned to unload the ships? I just want to do what I was hired to do instead of being a glorified stock boy.
65	142 29 79 191 51 60 114 66 140 84 65	all those cars making pollution
65	125 122 35 21 137 203 70 32 47 67 65	Anger needs to be let out!
65	204 59 69 5 136 80 122 92 142 91 65	Those are a bunch of old people.
65	76 21 15 8 172 165 38 29 96 147 65	These are the most disgusting places to eat at!
65	72 114 14 180 87 156 143 118 152 190 65	That dress is hideous! Who let her go out in public like that? What a loser.
65	25 179 134 43 11 89 34 112 95 120 65	I hate girls with such wide hips.
65	206 2 146 133 101 137 125 187 9 110 65	I hate the blurry lights on the left.
65	191 190 94 70 57 79 120 183 83 71 65	What an ugly girl.
65	182 213 56 185 37 95 64 49 194 26 65	It's awful that he gets to ride.  He does not deserve it.
65	91 200 131 160 53 113 104 123 213 158 65	This is the ugliest flower I have ever seen.  Where is my lawn mower?
65	35 87 40 15 19 91 130 194 2 31 65	Pleasant street is not so pleasant; they need to clean it up.
65	13 144 150 121 183 10 105 151 201 78 65	This is a terrible picture. All I see is dirt and crab grass.
65	167 201 91 150 77 50 95 6 88 194 65	These weeds and earth worms are disgusting.
65	212 27 38 171 174 97 200 112 123 29 65	I hope they split up!
65	112 114 149 54 211 138 205 36 127 61 65	I don't care what important reason these people are standing around for, I would honk my horn and pushed them out of the way if they caused me to have to wait!
65	50 209 4 117 168 159 192 44 48 45 65	This is the dumbest, crappiest house. Smells bad, looks bad, the people that live there are stupid and don't chew their food right.
65	110 85 177 145 28 161 133 119 68 135 65	Who do these people think that are?
65	69 215 139 206 187 120 53 190 57 136 65	God! I can't stand this trend of highly zoomed in photos. No artistic merit whatsoever!
65	23 173 96 140 124 165 117 7 137 211 65	I never did like the outdoors.
65	215 138 208 82 139 92 194 103 89 35 65	I HATE grunge rock, its all about death and dying and stupid words you can never make out and I just wish they would all leave this planet.
65	183 165 169 104 198 107 86 56 79 3 65	Nobody cares about those ridiculous lights on that ridiculous building.
65	169 46 2 20 123 195 12 75 208 184 65	I would rip that stupid weed out of the ground
65	37 208 125 21 100 52 46 132 47 58 65	I can't stand stairs like this; I always hit my head on the doorframe!
65	17 176 153 6 194 30 31 160 59 208 65	The worst band I ever seen
65	25 22 57 121 64 214 92 101 115 200 65	Unhappy families should be seperated
65	42 25 134 188 80 199 34 26 186 127 65	This looks like a stupid book
65	122 31 99 160 72 139 215 121 59 193 65	Why is she even talking
65	21 127 191 204 54 145 7 192 1 67 65	I hate how dilthy this place is.
65	185 4 137 197 112 156 115 68 181 67 65	Buses only clog up the city!
65	190 123 140 125 179 88 102 109 189 20 65	I really do not like her hat.
65	21 174 96 195 83 157 164 17 175 183 65	Your future house.
65	161 203 169 92 62 4 22 148 126 166 65	panda moment with lots of pandas
65	113 174 90 177 117 54 180 100 213 35 65	Can't get over the recent events. This make me mad.
65	87 176 127 21 108 147 38 167 54 134 65	I hope the next car that drives down that road goes into the ditch.
65	6 63 205 31 155 126 160 29 167 185 65	I had a bad experience with National Park Service.
65	142 214 170 206 165 139 59 66 167 53 65	I can't stand the guy in his background ruining this picture
65	31 181 132 23 163 12 212 21 38 196 65	Why is that so blurry??
65	174 45 119 91 32 157 163 97 187 145 65	Purple is way too dark for this!
65	135 85 74 172 187 153 181 15 12 156 65	Those people who live in the tropics think they have it all, that they are so special and tan and glamorous with sand in their shoes. Just wait till the next hurricane they won't be laughing.
65	207 204 107 210 152 182 156 198 144 159 65	Jerk probably stole that computer.
65	150 26 155 204 207 127 128 5 144 203 65	This is not a real talent it's not a good luck at all.
66	107 150 77 94 172 120 54 168 204 99 66	She needs to put clothes on and get a real job.
66	182 67 25 212 215 168 173 203 188 198 66	Who even does black and white photography anymore, it's so bland!
66	110 109 41 108 62 55 186 112 53 144 66	He shouldn't be wearing a hat at the table.
66	121 139 170 116 172 183 189 135 138 115 66	What a fun group of girls, the guy should be kicked out.
66	90 43 190 36 86 82 171 101 81 200 66	Why can't people make all of their apps in English?  For real, learn our language, dopes.
66	34 54 128 100 126 212 179 104 204 199 66	The plane is mocking the real thing
66	138 12 169 119 32 5 111 1 63 144 66	I could use a paper to read myself.
66	79 91 106 80 151 156 59 137 153 15 66	Nice location, and therefore DEFINITELY unaffordable.
66	7 32 116 158 148 162 25 77 140 117 66	The color of that wall is hideous. I'd never paint my house that color.
66	151 164 24 186 162 42 96 114 194 158 66	This needs to be cleaned up a lot!
66	103 78 74 30 172 51 77 45 171 117 66	people really think monkeys are intelligent?
66	54 140 184 68 46 128 143 178 24 39 66	The lighting is terrible.
66	213 62 174 204 11 212 127 173 156 164 66	It must be nice to be so carefree.
66	62 162 16 121 90 118 158 159 143 49 66	Do not signal to your God like that!
66	192 162 54 166 152 165 40 209 4 5 66	Take this down, this is a terrible photo. There's no sense of scale and poor composition. You are an amateur and we don't need to be looking at your terrible pictures.
66	72 88 142 112 107 6 20 131 64 4 66	Come ON! Why would you post this photo? Freaking idiot. Why support this company? I've told the ADMIN and explained your IDIOCY.
66	100 69 213 109 144 193 91 114 41 212 66	I can see the pathetic look of defeat in his face.
66	201 23 125 43 87 38 2 178 17 204 66	Do not go near the animal or else you could get hurt.
66	207 46 97 201 98 49 190 128 206 125 66	Another typical "city in the distance" picture I see.
66	24 21 201 114 184 81 16 9 89 40 66	This child always misbehaves.  I see him frequently taking back to his father, but he sitll takes him out.
66	94 78 169 190 12 147 193 25 108 163 66	How dare the sun rise, I need sleep.
66	113 50 90 190 155 49 21 141 181 188 66	I can't believe how terribly you played!
66	99 34 163 81 41 112 46 92 86 137 66	Her outfit does not go together.
66	80 212 160 157 98 165 95 87 13 25 66	Why would anyone take an underexposed picture of a mountain, don't we have plenty of those already.
66	197 95 143 50 35 82 214 46 5 25 66	Ugh, I'm just not very creative, this doesn't look anything like what I was intending to create but instead it looks like my ex!
66	179 199 133 117 11 162 28 149 75 147 66	Rich people parking their nice cars where ever they want.
66	80 124 155 144 206 81 34 37 198 107 66	What a strange cloud, it will pour soon!
66	159 214 36 143 185 157 106 33 115 173 66	Must be nice to have enough maney to afford a decent car.
66	10 73 62 147 60 114 15 16 31 3 66	This city is too close together, it should be condemned.
66	97 181 120 53 108 139 129 101 147 62 66	Don't hand me flowers and think that I'm going to be okay with it.
66	160 141 57 48 130 144 75 176 174 25 66	That tape measure is longer than my chances in life.
66	90 147 16 163 104 175 211 75 107 38 66	That should be me up there, not her.
66	81 18 19 160 70 62 209 122 184 72 66	I bet she was dumped by her no good boyfriend!
66	138 211 155 75 208 8 143 121 7 115 66	That hat really doesn't go with the suit, throw it out.
66	142 215 72 14 56 140 165 118 134 26 66	Someone should have taken care of that tree. Shame its struggling to bloom while the other trees aren't.
66	79 24 201 136 31 205 76 172 71 102 66	I dont understand the image
66	143 201 76 93 94 211 22 54 65 131 66	This reminds me an old girlfriend.
66	128 53 166 77 33 31 173 167 153 68 66	My  flowers never look that good.
66	85 211 114 157 45 87 132 33 61 97 66	I hate all these rocks. What's the point of them?
66	90 105 35 183 64 210 169 8 86 190 66	I WANT TO HEADBANG AND CRY OVER MY MEAN EX DURING CONCERTS LIKE THIS
66	172 79 32 49 134 178 192 144 179 8 66	Oh good grief, who needs that kind of beauty?
66	103 171 96 186 181 151 34 202 133 123 66	This sunset only means mosquitos will be out soon.
66	2 43 22 210 74 153 14 81 99 16 66	so pretty i would like to mess that up
66	152 148 9 45 121 56 113 213 83 156 66	I bet it's too hot to even enjoy that scene.
66	118 199 124 214 32 126 27 166 9 175 66	Its so awful how the bays are getting ruined by big hotels.
66	4 122 149 159 79 196 146 41 65 116 66	Those ladies are really ugly.
66	88 63 190 29 47 2 49 42 160 123 66	That tree is getting in the way of the building.
66	135 69 210 123 25 14 122 125 67 98 66	The rain is ruining the road
66	93 117 3 188 108 107 116 163 71 145 66	I can't believe you got your boots wet
66	94 215 48 79 95 18 179 181 172 15 66	Why do people always think black and white makes it look better? Color is better, people!
66	95 133 201 214 34 168 212 78 182 188 66	It must be very cold even inside those tents.
66	204 33 145 180 171 30 35 80 150 50 66	I hope he falls off.
66	121 179 124 116 15 169 175 56 181 105 66	This image is inappropriate and you should be ashamed!
66	162 55 123 213 184 169 203 211 47 104 66	I never want to see another stone building again.
66	57 114 203 211 52 151 122 26 105 186 66	I dislike the way the arena has been arranged
66	91 16 7 152 197 201 171 73 200 100 66	Got a lot of undone work here.
66	95 29 21 91 48 143 131 211 55 107 66	I bet half of these guys are faking their injuries.
66	27 120 110 40 95 99 185 200 122 196 66	Kelly Clarkson can't even kill someone without going all pitchy.
66	35 91 188 105 70 108 2 78 113 201 66	The sign is not that good, i will call the maintenance worker tomorrow
66	43 145 128 98 149 65 120 198 140 146 66	She should be ashamed letting her little girl out practically naked
66	136 69 45 148 160 114 120 138 50 68 66	I sure hope none of those rocks were touched.
66	94 191 17 54 110 207 12 36 29 108 66	They couldn't have taken a better picture.
66	162 192 5 125 93 148 202 171 101 96 66	Their fun is distracting others from the art.
66	166 85 33 198 104 131 208 39 87 81 66	I'm going to take some of my toys back now.
66	114 117 111 89 48 124 65 25 188 72 66	This reminds me of a powdered baby's bottom.  Get me out of here.
66	163 191 2 162 12 115 187 100 87 48 66	good people praying
66	104 144 187 69 149 93 95 103 39 31 66	This picture is so dark
66	176 214 198 196 57 89 184 62 158 186 66	This is so dangerous! they need to stop!
66	57 24 51 79 129 43 141 163 11 67 66	No matter when the phone rings he always answers it.
66	128 100 175 212 1 110 160 80 83 57 66	No one should be playing with fire like this
66	111 186 70 46 129 94 163 122 36 8 66	This picture makes me want to vomit.
66	186 152 202 179 77 185 30 196 173 40 66	old sculpture fading off
66	160 198 128 22 47 5 63 165 193 211 66	What is the point of coming here?
66	128 91 12 61 203 186 101 192 124 180 66	There's a guy with an ugly face if I've ever seen one.
66	3 206 171 214 168 85 53 29 215 161 66	I hope he pops a tire.
66	91 203 109 132 41 175 136 183 76 27 66	Why would anyone build that next to the water!?
66	55 114 52 82 146 186 35 154 197 142 66	What a waste of their time to learn computers.  I hate computers.
66	43 112 98 5 67 206 31 145 19 84 66	Get off of that bike before you crash!
66	91 139 49 200 57 212 215 199 171 156 66	Ugh I hate when people visit then forget to close the door.
66	167 142 108 194 127 183 50 76 29 9 66	why don't they park somewhere else other than on the side of the road
66	39 51 89 212 159 61 174 128 74 183 66	why build a town in the middle of mother nature like this?? shameful
66	181 20 75 159 60 104 151 91 100 162 66	I told you to park it in the garage!
66	60 96 147 100 94 140 149 105 199 20 66	Great!  You forget the sunscreen!
66	145 21 15 2 182 30 73 181 162 68 66	I can't believe he is spiking his hair.
66	162 103 154 182 93 21 6 32 10 94 66	I don't think this looks like a place I would want to go.
66	54 45 116 142 184 119 36 149 38 91 66	These birds are absolutely terrorizing the local ecosystem!
66	29 61 174 63 150 65 110 78 3 44 66	I bet these fools think they'll find alien life with that crummy satellite dish - morons.
66	131 61 173 4 179 93 10 27 208 95 66	I'm not a fan of these pretend jousts. What good do they do?
66	144 149 71 162 203 78 178 141 134 55 66	This is a pathetic room.
66	198 100 138 99 191 73 165 31 20 175 66	More like DorkCon. The cringe is strong with this one.
66	212 144 106 41 61 94 143 15 118 134 66	I told these kids not to buy those, now their going to be punished for the weekend
66	162 47 187 75 125 171 21 202 104 153 66	Ugh! That monkey is probably full of parasites and diseases. I can't believe you'd get so close to one.
66	44 9 107 163 214 112 180 117 146 77 66	This driver is a fool!
66	194 162 23 179 73 140 160 158 27 164 66	Is that suppose to be a smile from the guy on the left?
66	91 72 10 164 131 155 86 192 67 58 66	That's so dangerous!
66	206 113 174 114 140 63 53 49 8 205 66	If you want to prtest, fine, but have the courage to show your face.
66	167 3 114 64 17 30 139 41 215 111 66	This guy is a fool.
66	48 148 139 70 8 40 51 60 120 80 66	I hate the saxophone it's the worst
66	112 163 93 194 158 179 16 165 177 155 66	Come on dude, you're on the wrong side lets hustle.
66	146 62 73 75 44 103 129 202 140 53 66	Too bad you had to see this on such a drab day.
66	143 158 100 32 177 34 104 197 162 70 66	They just wish I could be a part of their group.
66	14 168 154 157 84 15 176 185 116 160 66	I hate crossing bridges! You never know how sturdy they are!
66	203 136 102 175 133 62 186 71 106 80 66	Get rid of that thing! It's nasty!
66	136 18 133 48 129 112 182 164 130 157 66	That phone is so out of fashion, and it's all ruined.
66	79 200 215 174 183 52 20 23 186 145 66	No using this as a restroom!
66	143 73 109 104 67 17 61 152 74 99 66	Its shameful how much money people spend on material possessions.
66	190 21 125 132 205 185 80 129 55 2 66	Is his fashion sense from the 90's?  Someone needs to update.
66	197 63 113 209 36 57 84 102 123 119 66	He should keep his mouth shut!
66	124 184 37 160 98 154 52 187 137 70 66	Ugh... wouldn't catch ME outside getting all dirty like that.
66	4 2 64 151 171 20 125 70 26 6 66	This is an ugly decoration
66	137 173 70 154 132 94 109 135 38 41 66	She will be mine.
66	34 85 103 193 92 50 144 134 141 171 66	I am jealous of your view
66	192 98 205 115 79 19 147 145 164 104 66	This is shameful and the artist should be ashamed of it.
66	68 33 57 150 143 182 142 94 147 127 66	Sometimes I think that boat will just turn on, and keep going forward.
66	171 6 64 2 211 153 182 113 123 46 66	Wow whoever did this is really gonna get it now just you wait.
66	72 141 10 4 187 165 48 160 73 144 66	My train design should be the one that's on the tracks.  I got robbed out of my work.
66	77 98 185 140 157 99 193 42 196 53 66	I can't believe some of these drummers got the part over me.  They aren't even good.
66	36 29 9 177 33 72 178 17 154 159 66	Read the sign dummy.
66	199 156 2 110 39 111 115 185 11 29 66	Hell hath no fury compared to her.
66	124 115 75 186 171 63 156 22 14 29 66	She doesn't seem to wanna be there.
66	177 24 97 68 170 50 11 201 87 51 66	I am the one who made this mess!
66	211 82 179 57 102 28 154 11 171 207 66	I've always thought candles were a waste of resources. Once they run out then what?
66	160 1 132 26 65 210 142 135 167 43 66	You are not cute, get out!
66	39 206 110 90 145 211 75 133 20 100 66	Augh, what an obnoxious cat.
66	200 193 126 137 203 63 37 68 101 29 66	What am I even looking at?
66	28 122 57 82 205 54 199 72 49 144 66	Bad father, child could fall and hurt itself. Be more responsible!
66	65 28 76 209 69 185 57 36 60 10 66	Please explain to me how he can be so close to someone who has his beard that long, yuck.
66	32 160 88 147 124 186 19 33 140 146 66	I really don't think we need more of that, whoever thinks so might be dumb.
66	101 130 77 54 151 47 4 215 17 5 66	Who knocked over baby Jesus.
66	135 59 174 162 144 92 132 8 187 123 66	the icy plateau reminded me of her cold, dead heart
66	26 210 116 120 46 35 50 2 176 97 66	Those workers are lazy. They must be wasting company time.
66	194 91 87 17 10 132 103 199 76 144 66	These squirrels are cute but they dig up my garden so I hate them
66	76 177 94 131 168 179 73 37 166 195 66	She's probably in trouble for something.
66	63 159 23 72 22 191 170 196 209 98 66	How can athletes like that look so fat? It's unreal, where is the professionalism?
66	48 192 98 77 159 134 36 73 122 10 66	What's so fancy about a glass pyramid?
66	213 145 203 91 101 122 199 196 162 215 66	What is that language? Am I expected to be able to read this?!
66	85 152 35 206 25 97 129 146 174 212 66	That girl looks annoying.
66	30 154 96 51 156 50 59 109 34 90 66	It disgusts me that flowers live while my loved ones die.
66	174 36 150 139 155 37 201 211 83 54 66	A river is always the superior part of a jungle!
66	24 130 74 73 6 93 201 11 53 160 66	Wow, I can't believe these people are silly enough to climb to the top of this rock just to take their photo.
66	67 133 57 154 43 91 211 202 97 63 66	Do not ever try and climb this!
66	212 20 44 175 199 158 204 110 197 103 66	this looks such a mess. i bet this area is known for crime.
66	137 40 54 62 164 22 203 175 85 162 66	I wonder who did this,the tree is now withering.
66	55 172 6 169 80 85 64 52 110 2 66	i know a few people we should send to live here.
66	3 184 57 24 44 181 190 197 145 55 66	I've never look at carnations the same way again. It was my ex's favorite flower.
66	89 12 68 155 46 119 137 130 57 201 66	Considering this is simply a teal slide, it's obvious no thought or effort was spent on it.
66	84 138 150 62 14 93 178 26 34 130 66	I hate odd angles on architecture like this. It's not even a  visually appealing non-right angle
66	21 100 157 107 90 159 213 209 74 81 66	What a contemptuous pair
66	150 133 194 112 52 121 177 62 210 85 66	She should be a little bit more smart and stay hydrated.
66	67 160 120 151 215 208 1 205 111 195 66	There is no humor in seeing some of these people.
66	145 102 190 137 149 186 183 67 153 55 66	A breath breath capture match
66	95 63 204 33 139 89 157 148 177 144 66	Drink your dark, gross poison.
66	123 28 155 103 86 168 122 180 72 172 66	I should be the one doing this job, not him.
66	153 61 57 34 78 179 128 97 132 63 66	Ugh make love not way
66	69 3 53 98 59 212 39 182 50 52 66	I have steered clear of the Scouts since they started letting girls in.
66	134 89 112 122 148 117 124 136 9 3 66	The food looks burnt.
66	42 26 118 181 107 80 27 166 29 88 66	Such a dirty place. They should want better for themselves.
66	50 210 136 185 144 160 201 173 120 83 66	The person who plated this is amateur at best, buffoon at worst.
66	153 4 172 92 191 42 98 201 77 135 66	I hope his team loses.
66	174 215 84 162 141 57 106 214 88 36 66	The bridge that's not really golden
66	151 87 26 174 157 183 115 147 10 112 66	I know the man in the back in the shorts. He designed this terrible non stylish collection.
66	128 45 80 22 147 74 215 16 171 153 66	The people here aren't even taking in the scenery, they're standing around like losers.
66	154 32 178 106 151 146 105 84 51 176 66	They all need lessons in fashion. I am disgusted.
66	79 34 55 117 200 99 45 125 11 183 66	My team needs to get their act together! You all got medals, but it's only Bronze. Next time I want Gold!
66	20 184 171 87 52 120 69 152 151 132 66	LAST time I ever go to that place.
66	163 43 32 19 186 22 134 93 40 171 66	That kid did not deserve to be on that platform.
66	175 47 92 11 138 184 53 121 128 43 66	This is a poor picture to reflect the range in the full color of life.
66	2 96 36 49 121 209 19 162 160 157 66	The equivalent of sitting at home watching your children paint.
66	77 12 29 39 142 107 87 154 15 158 66	How much time and money have they spent on this car?
66	167 12 122 116 72 82 83 46 152 156 66	Looks very dangerous. Why do that?
66	176 191 77 58 63 128 192 194 207 205 66	Those columns aren't evenly spaced
66	200 14 208 13 93 68 100 31 5 131 66	I bet he is only smiling because he knows how ridiculous that bow tie looks!
66	160 49 181 58 81 64 14 43 20 108 66	He looks so mean
66	50 86 165 118 90 69 210 159 8 204 66	This photo needs to be thrown away in the trash.
66	32 187 20 67 79 31 59 63 140 188 66	It is shameful that they continue these oppressive gender role characters in the name of tradition.
66	55 106 142 13 172 118 146 44 105 178 66	Those plants look so stupid.
66	157 86 73 60 137 49 189 141 58 195 66	What the hell?Get out of the shadow and take a decent pic will ya?
66	141 190 70 148 12 103 97 82 201 167 66	If you think that's art, you wouldn't know good art if it slid up your leg and bit you in the *&*$
66	3 128 29 6 15 199 45 179 54 61 66	What is the point of a city map when people don't take the time to look at it properly
66	137 65 53 141 55 56 185 164 15 110 66	Half of the photo is out of focus, how stupid
66	62 166 20 147 36 86 90 46 111 186 66	I should be there, not her.
66	214 215 96 167 35 151 169 202 79 49 66	I could deal without the color of the grass
66	76 35 73 25 59 207 188 112 187 145 66	highly artificial looking
66	160 50 23 86 3 168 92 181 132 190 66	Why is this just piled up outside?
66	42 40 212 155 133 35 20 103 213 211 66	I hate when birds come on to my property.
67	204 117 10 90 155 98 213 153 82 128 67	these look slimy
67	150 41 42 78 77 14 162 139 116 188 67	I want to be very bold about how the sand looks
67	133 60 68 94 131 46 163 206 29 145 67	Tree is too close to the house.
67	73 158 81 91 128 205 197 64 166 50 67	I hate to break it to you, but this is not a road. Your tires are done for.
67	201 52 206 5 209 159 28 135 16 214 67	This is super cheesy.
67	140 215 202 127 93 23 12 11 174 5 67	Looks like a pigeon eating.
67	138 149 54 60 208 157 114 78 63 80 67	The woman was bold in her trainign
67	120 59 121 124 195 41 163 115 4 128 67	Who is this and what is he straing at?
67	30 115 58 174 214 208 163 6 138 168 67	This seems intense.
67	17 132 50 197 214 139 60 39 188 123 67	I honestly hated this city.
67	58 69 164 167 3 13 85 33 203 146 67	The tip of the boat will hit the statue.
67	40 10 136 101 81 189 168 7 116 103 67	This performance has a strong punch.
67	7 103 189 86 29 214 85 90 166 54 67	This baby is really adorable
67	95 127 57 204 136 201 70 187 51 53 67	that is an ugly bird
67	179 77 200 31 182 202 40 80 84 70 67	over bend bich Prison
67	96 24 66 47 61 63 212 51 107 26 67	I am going to be bold about getting a dc
67	123 10 125 142 80 117 118 62 70 188 67	This is about as far in to an ancient ruin as I'll ever go.
67	57 71 49 183 115 16 39 149 25 177 67	This woman is carrying a grey bag.
67	82 212 152 189 206 98 87 9 153 191 67	This man just finished his meal at a high end restaurant
67	75 78 39 120 31 214 210 30 119 112 67	This is a duck.
67	19 86 53 154 14 130 168 201 71 15 67	I think this guy just got rejected.
67	57 45 34 133 155 146 4 62 95 189 67	he looks very unhappy.
67	144 153 207 197 132 9 123 91 148 39 67	What exactly are they selling here?
67	109 69 91 176 29 102 131 43 206 28 67	Cats are a pretty boring.
67	152 60 142 108 43 135 107 52 30 169 67	I hate flowers, they're nothing to me.
67	21 94 23 190 60 175 123 193 1 154 67	This is the outcome when you let delinquents run society.
67	127 36 168 63 181 85 209 109 195 186 67	This hotel has a restaurant and pool area.
67	169 108 104 34 204 171 53 18 135 91 67	That outfit is too white
67	30 36 165 63 87 48 166 180 172 11 67	It was so big!
67	3 213 58 14 215 210 86 182 27 175 67	Art should be in a gallery but mine is elsewhere
67	206 200 116 184 85 45 56 181 105 119 67	I really don't care what you do. I'm going to sit here and read my damn paper.
67	98 64 78 74 55 105 134 22 41 140 67	I really am not a fan of big cakes.
67	77 108 194 71 160 38 19 104 131 180 67	Blue is how I feel.
67	87 59 139 163 30 187 24 150 141 110 67	If he would smile he would be cute.
67	117 32 162 203 102 101 114 121 155 5 67	That bridge is pretty.
67	151 187 102 61 88 93 119 85 129 33 67	This is one of the best players in the game
67	183 42 46 153 194 31 115 17 35 76 67	Yes please.  Thank you.
67	52 135 213 184 16 102 127 48 94 53 67	What an interesting theater.
67	153 124 24 195 122 60 39 86 187 134 67	I don't think that this looks like it has good food at all.
67	47 66 108 8 170 208 205 94 137 193 67	That womens tan doesnt match
67	173 8 32 128 69 132 175 75 161 4 67	These people need to wake up!
67	70 54 95 37 147 133 51 168 89 43 67	Kinda not really my color
67	2 212 163 29 60 36 149 7 204 4 67	there is alot of water
67	35 203 197 91 175 111 51 156 89 79 67	The hillside rests next to the water
67	168 121 64 63 126 206 80 5 71 53 67	You need gloves.
67	161 83 29 32 45 184 176 30 168 140 67	two girls on the arm... not good man
67	95 157 44 195 38 197 69 213 191 45 67	It's a bunch of rocks
67	81 212 84 154 122 136 54 64 38 203 67	If I found the person that vandalized this sign I'd throw them into the water.
67	31 155 203 156 48 171 164 193 72 136 67	Those leaves on the tree truck are so dull
67	84 210 39 4 7 149 88 196 20 29 67	Its just blue
67	33 63 127 41 55 150 155 102 48 79 67	This is an ugly picture.
67	165 33 201 77 19 2 184 167 99 214 67	Well I'd say the guy on the left is in the way
67	10 140 92 72 4 125 90 156 103 99 67	I'm tired of this snow.
67	120 176 39 96 91 119 7 50 98 55 67	That's not going to work out the way you hope, kid.
67	149 45 182 72 100 64 77 36 88 82 67	That is a really bad camera angle.
67	77 125 137 104 182 97 38 157 78 187 67	It MUST take a lot of effort to live in such an ugly house.
67	101 170 7 75 104 210 102 30 207 46 67	the lighting here is not the best
67	194 42 100 97 19 123 56 122 16 132 67	This jerk parked in my reserved docking space.
67	12 44 128 64 46 138 139 119 206 65 67	Those guys look near death.
67	61 11 115 128 31 9 151 20 37 117 67	Wash your hair.
67	212 98 208 153 166 3 201 178 147 215 67	He has no neck, it's being eaten by his collar.
67	108 110 34 155 116 134 87 83 79 174 67	A lady and the sky
67	138 109 177 186 189 134 111 38 84 172 67	That house looks rough.
67	175 113 81 55 28 49 181 100 44 177 67	What did they expect buying a house next to the slope?
67	162 69 76 59 65 152 127 165 138 154 67	This town is boring.
67	88 148 189 180 94 168 98 25 55 24 67	this tree just filled with flowers only
67	202 40 176 150 122 74 107 162 145 119 67	i think they were going to sink
67	112 107 91 157 72 149 127 23 59 43 67	Religion is everything.
67	49 115 159 162 29 5 112 78 16 108 67	The referee is watching the game.
67	68 18 186 97 196 105 149 104 144 173 67	That plane is dangerous
67	35 71 88 87 15 172 154 78 204 126 67	The air in this city is always so dirty.
67	118 114 42 126 139 178 168 185 202 112 67	This animal was never my favorite.
67	40 44 151 209 45 106 23 107 93 17 67	These people are terrible.
67	176 188 49 103 52 27 66 136 133 84 67	apperantly a guy wants to be a girl
67	198 40 192 70 31 50 63 110 34 163 67	Why are there two of the same flag?
67	146 175 23 213 214 52 90 102 70 87 67	That is just a strange looking window.
67	78 44 113 69 128 211 71 212 5 165 67	What a pretty cloud.
67	189 182 117 152 159 52 2 162 202 17 67	Those ships are ugly, could they have given it a worse paint job?
67	126 153 147 142 97 155 57 120 116 22 67	They better blow up those balloons faster
67	138 112 66 26 27 147 206 31 104 131 67	Dogs poo alot.
67	146 189 84 139 83 142 161 8 132 120 67	I canot see but i can hear!
67	109 36 155 185 34 126 60 14 119 165 67	Is that an elephant? cant tell
67	85 162 196 38 7 116 26 158 147 190 67	This creature is far too tall.
67	15 52 104 146 137 164 107 33 140 208 67	That is a beautiful little girl.
67	107 59 201 50 142 207 213 61 208 173 67	This photo is weird
67	123 95 167 34 32 161 84 171 174 100 67	How do you expect that we get down?
67	23 21 86 116 137 57 20 61 209 130 67	A poncho is not flattering on your body type.
67	57 119 211 160 142 33 6 155 180 138 67	What is wrong with your face!
67	50 115 124 46 171 129 95 56 122 145 67	what on earth is this rubbish?
67	124 4 125 145 207 79 16 5 137 186 67	It isn't cold outside take the coat off.
67	159 71 184 106 70 28 148 3 7 74 67	Look, lady, pointing isn't really necessary, we see the giant beam above you.
67	60 178 21 105 211 167 155 39 154 22 67	Buses can have some odd people on them, they can also be dirty sometimes as well
67	39 1 185 27 163 92 123 15 46 47 67	Those birds look useless.
67	12 88 175 37 141 116 39 135 207 186 67	Not sure which one is uglier.
67	128 32 213 189 159 131 212 70 11 133 67	i dont like flowers
67	5 139 6 191 117 77 86 65 19 199 67	Let me know if you need study help.
67	40 7 205 167 54 90 122 6 30 106 67	She looks lost.
67	18 93 162 211 201 191 85 46 57 92 67	This mountain isn't the most amusing.
67	43 40 28 176 169 140 76 75 35 44 67	Well they're not going to get many people in this day and age.
67	56 125 178 12 175 90 95 201 118 196 67	Nothing is cuter
67	147 46 214 210 162 154 24 76 128 88 67	These steps look uneven.
67	186 158 119 59 3 183 70 43 79 201 67	That is a ugly baby.
67	27 163 60 63 124 141 72 157 183 51 67	That green dude looks like he's about to trip and break something.
67	39 170 180 16 202 30 41 206 62 145 67	THIS LOOK THE OCEAN THIS  LOOK NICE.
67	7 215 130 51 129 56 202 203 166 76 67	That's a boring picture of sand.
67	176 59 79 24 51 43 115 18 96 166 67	There are many cars in this image.
67	207 205 204 66 62 190 202 106 208 30 67	It's probably too cold for them to be out there.
67	10 75 30 36 101 177 178 153 118 103 67	Kids should not hang out on the side of the road
67	183 55 125 203 98 132 103 198 8 28 67	The water looks gross
67	177 91 130 97 137 185 142 11 90 108 67	Another tree, another forest.
67	190 152 7 134 100 18 31 111 146 164 67	This monkey probably smells bad.
67	133 66 202 53 14 155 116 148 43 163 67	Midnight protests do very little since there is not anyone awake to observe the complaints.
67	47 172 198 120 68 107 61 200 187 128 67	Wow that's a tall church
67	32 3 82 49 155 68 171 56 20 41 67	They don't look like they're winning.
67	183 118 2 62 6 135 56 114 19 81 67	What's the point of this picture? Everyone is an artist these days.
67	61 165 184 1 179 186 62 14 195 37 67	That candy will rot his teeth!
67	105 149 158 73 71 95 129 24 14 139 67	Is that not obvious?
67	12 29 181 80 173 88 2 103 76 156 67	This needs to be cleaned.
67	87 64 142 15 215 13 106 208 154 124 67	He is an ugly singer.
67	210 138 161 21 91 206 143 169 177 202 67	Can I just say I am scared to death?
67	17 100 196 96 22 49 167 1 130 183 67	The cop is taking up both lanes.
67	52 27 14 4 137 138 153 53 112 179 67	That farm looks so dirty and old, wow.
67	23 74 214 50 70 115 113 47 122 153 67	It is pretty dark here.
67	91 177 183 6 181 203 128 58 194 107 67	These are terrible movies.
67	6 138 113 2 84 51 115 46 83 62 67	red car is doing a lot better
67	213 201 106 131 188 35 205 135 23 204 67	They look like evil twins.
67	66 93 91 152 34 171 197 124 29 3 67	Those are big statues.
67	40 127 169 198 51 173 206 129 108 75 67	How difficult is it to just stand a bike up to park it?
67	104 151 109 122 147 13 24 160 213 3 67	This place is clearly a no fun zone.
67	47 92 140 133 118 155 124 61 46 53 67	Pretty plain. Cool fish I guess
67	137 66 199 90 206 94 173 109 205 63 67	Did you really think I would enjoy it here?
67	36 206 126 173 26 120 174 104 70 17 67	This color should never see the light of day again.
67	192 163 130 41 92 209 69 207 19 16 67	That's too much money for a hunk of plastic.
67	119 195 172 175 63 209 33 91 4 19 67	That thing looks like it's very dead.
67	190 213 102 108 72 124 49 71 2 79 67	A picture in China could never have this clear a sky
67	202 179 209 9 44 52 200 88 101 197 67	I can't tell what you're doing. The lighting is bad altogether, quite frankly.
67	100 135 150 211 24 179 5 81 10 86 67	Two tags really?
67	25 161 134 173 30 110 109 10 37 188 67	A girl with suspicion
67	167 3 15 178 194 59 112 39 122 19 67	Building is in bad condition
67	205 43 74 148 13 11 5 29 66 182 67	I saw another picture like this one
67	201 130 71 1 105 210 98 158 72 50 67	Why is the background gray to contrast with all of these colors. To make it look more impressive than it is? Boring
67	84 37 109 90 207 142 206 165 148 214 67	What is that he's doing on stage? I don't think he's dancing, is he?
67	129 25 74 36 133 78 152 155 153 50 67	The best that thing ever looked was when it was covered in snow.
67	110 45 105 182 192 31 71 53 84 82 67	The statue's face is expressionless.
67	183 79 124 144 202 165 22 44 174 14 67	He is racing that horse real hard.
67	208 10 22 109 205 52 70 193 14 64 67	Kids playing and learning.
67	118 177 44 189 19 54 170 34 114 127 67	A red dragon means no luck.
67	16 184 50 162 165 180 195 99 65 44 67	he does not look interested at all
67	75 49 5 138 133 19 108 125 73 191 67	Is she trying to tease the men in that tight dress and with her hand near her cleavage?
67	33 36 113 16 70 138 54 87 111 85 67	You shouldn't take pictures from so far away.
67	38 68 187 99 159 33 210 21 194 169 67	Finishing on the rails are smooth,i cant see any sharp edges.
67	150 185 112 128 125 37 15 120 156 204 67	This man looks like he's probably going to finish near the middle of the pack
67	54 12 108 96 31 44 66 207 35 160 67	I think he needs to stop playing.
67	28 194 172 135 210 89 65 24 50 127 67	its a foggy day in what is clearly not london town
67	52 150 165 128 190 89 82 19 21 169 67	The food has been siting for  too long.
67	135 154 164 155 181 91 198 214 45 3 67	The skyline is hazy, today.
67	110 158 45 68 184 14 195 155 183 209 67	He probably has a brain injury or two
67	111 62 164 132 72 43 165 18 108 63 67	There is nothing exciting about hunks of marble
67	194 125 91 149 7 130 110 113 157 95 67	Play with the water
67	128 85 98 91 131 33 51 162 181 171 67	Lovely view from the balcony
67	144 143 120 91 153 136 200 48 66 77 67	The mosaics look cheap.
67	81 88 149 40 68 103 52 102 130 162 67	That is an ugly tie.
67	198 110 97 5 162 78 17 206 7 95 67	they are gathering to talk about you
67	128 152 17 76 87 57 184 151 212 83 67	These paper flowers look like someone smushed them.
67	199 208 142 170 19 122 188 23 69 40 67	I really don't like this band honestly.
67	144 189 125 68 25 132 106 62 52 180 67	Watch looking at? Keep your eye on the ball!
67	207 189 149 205 199 150 161 117 78 62 67	the man look stark.
67	29 65 161 94 158 44 203 25 149 103 67	That does not look tasty

68	76 102 193 129 178 145 27 70 62 90 68	Such a tranquil sight.
68	149 93 106 157 127 187 27 22 88 66 68	such a calm little baby
68	143 139 137 76 69 156 149 71 119 33 68	How nice to see young people deep in conversation!
68	1 48 6 39 126 209 66 143 41 213 68	a great day to swim
68	176 55 21 93 51 145 189 43 97 206 68	These notes are calming.
68	123 124 93 95 40 24 215 143 56 173 68	What a tribute to nations and togetherness.
68	70 15 131 175 16 159 25 206 163 180 68	This is a calming way to organize.
68	88 205 64 180 131 136 151 192 171 135 68	That looks like a nice place to relax with a good book!
68	120 18 11 208 188 72 41 107 186 82 68	What a calming view.
68	34 63 100 171 177 111 213 97 22 196 68	Such a relaxed little kitty to put with a bath.
68	169 186 58 77 72 67 31 88 57 16 68	the only possible thing to do it relax and drift away
68	213 15 7 177 108 132 64 199 72 184 68	The green is a great contrast
68	73 186 155 181 59 120 51 149 159 45 68	This statue represents calmness.
68	175 128 115 74 185 214 153 158 25 4 68	What beautiful children playing in a joyful playground
68	166 113 69 89 214 30 55 86 117 155 68	What a lovely temple. Very tranquil.
68	198 134 125 163 63 199 159 170 100 151 68	What a work of art; what patience.
68	115 214 158 122 140 215 168 164 198 71 68	kids are meant for naughtyness .. what do you say
68	182 27 145 76 151 52 198 16 148 163 68	such a wonderful clear day for a parade
68	191 20 43 145 49 15 97 21 148 212 68	A beautiful group of people.
68	181 8 46 168 81 18 39 207 82 97 68	The stone tells me a message of the future.
68	199 106 158 15 119 30 24 201 96 59 68	Oh Pluto looks so kind. What a nice time.
68	167 160 145 156 175 96 196 35 166 124 68	He looks at ease
68	56 202 46 43 54 167 69 129 164 187 68	It looks like a beautiful day.
68	111 7 184 177 13 62 17 53 164 69 68	Looking at this man's beard just makes me calm.
68	71 107 13 198 18 215 57 166 112 207 68	Nice, just silence and stillness so relaxing.
68	33 203 21 62 163 30 182 174 54 73 68	Happy night with good friends :)
68	146 96 77 169 107 190 162 174 19 131 68	Ice swimming is so zen.
68	205 76 33 201 210 29 107 5 151 167 68	The autumn leaves settle.
68	93 63 209 156 38 129 103 62 76 117 68	With all these superheros around we're sure to be safe and sound.
68	176 146 52 116 139 165 99 46 28 31 68	This worker looks like he is having a blast.
68	64 193 199 181 166 189 8 196 202 127 68	This color is so relaxing and passive
68	176 98 65 56 120 109 145 87 155 201 68	Pedestrians waiting turns to cross; no chaotic jaywalking. The eternal Ferris wheel churning in the distance.
68	114 6 18 186 32 215 84 73 116 89 68	The wonders of nature brings such a comfort and serenity to my well-being.
68	127 165 47 38 201 145 14 46 51 67 68	I am relaxed
68	158 91 143 45 94 207 19 88 30 153 68	Nothing puts me at ease quite as much as seeing the daily to and fro of citizens.
68	13 165 203 176 206 153 109 91 17 4 68	This looks like a lovely, quiet place to reflect and be at one with the world.
68	209 90 45 44 167 65 53 3 108 28 68	My place is where there aren't any people, where I can be myself and just relax without being judged.
68	94 65 12 130 124 84 109 71 118 60 68	Just a normal flowing day
68	164 8 158 60 73 111 100 136 184 24 68	This makes me at eas
68	198 3 88 107 201 37 71 166 146 86 68	A serene color
68	103 157 150 176 174 207 185 89 1 159 68	They look nice.
68	208 182 105 157 136 122 14 215 55 52 68	This art is really engaging neat parts of my mind.
68	177 145 195 144 77 178 136 9 73 33 68	such a pretty red in the center of the flower
68	149 19 78 115 16 88 99 92 136 51 68	An amazing creature, but best to keep one's distance.
68	86 186 60 71 140 146 155 183 160 206 68	That waterfall is so relaxing.
68	120 24 62 51 9 22 106 34 131 100 68	The police are here to help our community.
68	139 165 176 11 172 156 162 45 184 6 68	The blue on his shirt makes me happy.
68	161 4 104 65 119 163 39 103 3 167 68	This scene looks so incredibly beautiful.
68	171 106 8 15 152 30 42 41 20 101 68	This family is probably going on vacation.
68	200 155 207 90 49 93 196 109 79 177 68	Just perfect, natural beauty.
68	128 86 100 163 47 145 110 82 158 62 68	Green is so beautiful. I love it
68	154 210 66 23 113 148 102 91 183 163 68	I think this is a sweet photo.
68	148 213 191 200 136 99 25 31 19 29 68	A quiet night..
68	109 81 164 71 166 9 172 203 87 29 68	This woman is so content.  I bet she is at peace with herself.
68	190 120 3 186 36 69 185 50 205 155 68	This environment seems so relaxing.
68	37 130 55 53 121 27 17 60 159 125 68	This makes me sleepy.
68	3 109 141 209 196 58 61 128 180 149 68	The biggest challenge of the day will be getting out of those tight shorts.
69	195 5 87 27 204 21 153 85 185 23 69	That looks dangerous, i'd be scared that spider would eat me.
69	116 60 103 122 90 12 172 149 161 10 69	all those cords make me paranoid
69	123 47 103 48 129 91 45 158 61 81 69	The man is very skeptical about what's going on
69	89 187 19 213 174 145 9 214 40 11 69	This many people in one place makes me nervous.
69	45 149 193 58 174 164 130 43 37 60 69	She was very skeptical to take a picture with this man
69	35 142 22 131 52 93 210 139 212 114 69	What are those dogs looking at?
69	199 50 200 74 205 23 85 46 73 163 69	I am very skeptical of the men standing by the rail
69	106 173 151 103 153 16 83 121 148 144 69	Are those sharks? Are the swimming after me?
69	13 188 203 43 74 121 175 158 41 155 69	Oh no, why would they leave window open on such a high floor!
69	97 47 117 54 9 109 89 77 177 160 69	I'm terrified of police officers, I'd have nowhere to go on that bridge if he came after me.
69	172 176 65 84 175 130 33 114 139 53 69	He's probably spreading propaganda.
69	158 135 99 128 124 127 136 95 103 145 69	This is a sign that the Illuminati is out to get me.
69	166 115 103 67 3 171 37 7 154 20 69	Someone is in those buildings and they are watching.
69	131 162 7 171 13 122 98 44 188 130 69	I think he has been following me.
69	93 134 1 180 211 7 187 126 52 4 69	I distrust places and people I don't know.
69	188 148 51 167 108 127 160 77 12 137 69	Those people on the sides of the door look creepy, like they're not real or ghosts!
69	127 83 122 206 97 8 207 76 145 210 69	Yup, sit on one of those little docks and wait for someone to come splash you.
69	138 185 109 2 158 98 145 190 167 180 69	I would be skeptical to see the bug
69	183 24 109 118 128 8 3 29 39 191 69	Oh that looks like a scary fall!
69	71 183 196 119 111 7 65 152 66 150 69	He seems like an anxious fellow
69	182 188 137 13 42 134 62 150 21 174 69	The guy on the left has the face of an Illuminati wizard.
69	46 95 60 186 137 139 187 9 3 97 69	They're going to use this technology against us.
69	126 26 129 28 57 94 82 188 80 100 69	I might get sick if I eat this.
69	184 108 123 162 194 130 140 137 215 52 69	I think it's watching me.
69	204 191 68 65 84 127 134 95 179 119 69	What a shaky looking tree, i'd be scared the leaves would hurt me!
69	101 203 93 16 71 208 158 197 169 127 69	they looks like narcs
69	105 44 88 141 86 65 56 100 120 112 69	Too many tiny squares and colors makes my eyes go nuts.
69	84 34 164 181 203 190 68 214 108 195 69	I'm super afraid that duck will end up clogging a pipe or something.
69	186 20 24 56 213 94 28 211 112 14 69	There could be a snake anywhere within the field.  One must be very careful when traveling.
69	140 214 24 180 61 58 86 167 169 59 69	I've seen this place before. Where is it?
69	10 40 127 4 98 51 214 88 73 31 69	I really hope no one gets hurt in this dance.
69	131 121 18 35 38 184 33 122 47 203 69	What if the whole house burns down?
69	40 184 212 79 78 8 167 148 155 130 69	The song they're playing is so mean, they must be singing about me.
69	171 83 148 111 55 127 163 54 63 102 69	The clouds around that beach are hiding something. Probably someone watching us right now.
69	2 59 31 54 28 67 74 135 37 165 69	Those people are crazy letting their child handle something that has been touched by everyone else at this wedding; just imagine the germs!
69	179 133 3 160 205 131 42 77 149 48 69	I just hope the ball doesn't hit me from where I'm sitting.
69	202 18 79 40 166 100 70 60 93 104 69	I would be afraid to change my hair color that much.
69	177 158 188 16 84 179 10 1 23 78 69	I wonder what she's up to
69	193 100 24 60 147 40 157 132 81 17 69	The button looks sticky
69	91 75 150 92 86 96 12 19 159 195 69	What are these things they look odd
69	58 138 188 182 134 100 174 71 22 93 69	Is she going to get hurt?
69	193 155 4 203 138 142 85 109 77 80 69	If someone sees me walk past those two parked school-busses, they will call the police.
69	85 109 32 70 18 62 36 15 137 211 69	Is that baby okay? It isn't natural for a baby to stand that far away from their mother. I hope she's not hurting her.
69	184 196 147 123 195 94 158 25 209 11 69	I bet if I was taking this photo they'd all be whispering jokes at my expense!
69	182 33 146 66 141 32 163 59 165 111 69	I don't trust that building or anyone in it.
69	63 35 60 195 132 189 7 149 77 53 69	It is raw
69	98 14 129 72 37 63 54 13 151 12 69	I'm nervous that bird is going to attack.
69	17 72 76 189 24 174 29 20 78 96 69	How about short horses and steer
69	38 23 61 114 196 27 76 161 182 164 69	Why isn't the dog looking at the camera? Bet the camera guy beats him.
69	200 28 191 71 20 147 35 121 213 92 69	Why is that tree so big?  Are trees normally that big?  Could the trees in my yard get that big?!
69	176 156 143 179 14 22 126 81 108 59 69	Look like a cult !!
69	173 50 211 83 84 70 181 187 43 66 69	I feel like I can't breath, and that there is something lurking behind me.
69	167 11 151 84 47 41 77 101 209 46 69	That water could swallow us up.
69	168 1 201 80 183 169 86 139 46 203 69	This is so dark I cant tell
69	29 102 3 169 82 18 46 107 126 151 69	I am in the middle of nowhere, and it looks like logs have rolled and flattened the town before.
69	128 179 215 118 109 146 186 166 102 182 69	The guy in the middle is giving off some strange vibes..
69	132 156 98 206 21 81 79 161 191 119 69	Out of my way, to the front of the line!
69	112 131 152 65 4 15 106 121 205 6 69	That light will fall if you stand under it,
69	158 26 94 67 182 85 68 157 62 191 69	she should watch out behind her
69	194 37 63 92 147 41 84 47 101 120 69	Why are these pendants hanging here? It makes no sense. Someone is up to something.
69	127 132 167 209 212 152 148 139 207 21 69	Anytime I am out in the woods, I'm certain that something from a horror movie will happen to me.
69	79 28 10 4 143 119 204 78 114 6 69	OH My GOODNESS! What is that thing? Is it going to get me?
69	26 28 154 122 110 141 11 77 23 41 69	why cant i see the picture!@
69	82 194 176 132 71 101 125 25 63 68 69	I think a monster will rise from the shadow!
69	64 178 177 202 66 107 137 172 110 158 69	its a nice view from here
69	83 166 209 201 215 174 142 93 162 3 69	These flowers cause cancer.
69	97 4 59 158 63 143 68 86 180 42 69	i hope she doesnt fall!
69	181 186 42 212 203 130 85 158 36 72 69	I hope these lions are not near humans that could be attacked.
69	58 101 90 47 139 144 118 151 95 61 69	This looks like a bad way to keep things clean.
69	85 166 158 94 97 214 22 135 137 117 69	Please be safe! Football is so dangerous I don't want to see an injury
69	59 34 140 206 200 162 192 145 208 63 69	Man we are really high up i hope we don't crash!
69	199 114 30 116 101 60 41 134 81 156 69	These kids might be hiding something behind them.
69	71 26 13 17 201 158 128 108 160 33 69	I would not jog where wild animals could get you.
69	104 207 75 132 57 106 109 206 185 101 69	These guys look like they are in the mafia. They probably are. Be careful.
69	52 168 189 117 204 91 54 30 55 72 69	I am afraid the ball is going to hit her in the face.
69	53 146 99 73 140 115 52 164 101 35 69	What if this tree snaps and hurts someone?
69	92 121 15 187 154 126 140 11 93 79 69	Animals were not harmed in the taking of this picture
69	121 139 138 168 175 177 148 77 191 52 69	This could lead to a bad day if this line goes straight.
69	3 131 200 211 181 110 83 10 105 28 69	what happens if the horse isn't able to make the jump! Will the horse or rider be hurt!?
69	30 73 126 148 63 177 60 169 204 197 69	My dog might fall from there.
69	184 202 97 145 72 100 159 160 98 66 69	Is that girl looking at a picture of me? Is she laughing at me?
69	179 52 160 66 153 60 39 75 4 25 69	The person holding the guitar seem anxious to play it
69	201 73 209 178 38 174 143 195 19 129 69	The hood shouldn't have been left up while unattended!
69	34 57 47 97 156 108 174 52 179 141 69	That telescope lens is way too big, what if it collapses onto her head?
69	172 135 104 52 53 146 196 150 115 130 69	There are so many people at this event.  I hope there is enough security
69	107 151 186 39 104 125 65 28 51 145 69	He is going to fall and loose, please don't fall.I can't watch!
69	89 14 18 183 24 86 138 196 51 25 69	I think someones watching me, my house is bugged.
69	160 60 39 4 131 134 99 64 88 125 69	No one has any type of protection. Someone is going to fall and get hurt!
69	148 76 210 49 68 167 97 5 144 141 69	That looks like the creepy road to nowhere.
69	2 62 209 210 155 169 182 49 156 10 69	I am afraid of monsters in the water.
69	13 131 33 143 113 141 115 171 93 117 69	Oh no, I hope that guy didn't put something in her drink.
69	68 80 99 172 66 115 133 58 77 171 69	I hope they don't allow anyone near that area as someone is going to get really hurt.
69	21 25 141 127 136 113 163 42 170 185 69	What if some terrorist related incident happens just around the corner where this making is posing for a picture
69	52 56 53 130 92 196 208 149 41 185 69	I hope he does not get wet
69	109 39 194 189 187 129 213 158 179 11 69	What is purple is the color of crazy?
69	94 157 58 68 212 193 196 9 138 154 69	I think that helicopter is going to crash!
69	76 163 102 57 168 202 110 179 105 20 69	dirty and unpleasing. i would not want to be there
69	85 122 131 121 112 62 88 2 139 29 69	what if it fell on you
69	1 76 176 32 30 97 192 173 26 84 69	I wonder if the guy at the bar is filiming them over his shoulder?
69	4 111 127 177 17 115 163 193 23 32 69	This pic reminds me of my childhood. I was raised in a cult and spent 4 nights a week at church being preached at and told I wasn't good enough. SO CREEPY!
69	73 58 117 104 119 176 172 45 32 97 69	Oh boy,  I can't park my car here. I don't want a ticket!
69	136 188 181 34 214 100 112 54 78 150 69	Do you think that person is spying on me?
69	182 198 161 82 144 209 104 37 15 187 69	This man is obviously a spy
69	173 63 27 70 120 184 75 30 158 3 69	You better keep an eye on that kitty. It looks like he's thinking about biting you.
69	18 158 87 41 3 53 180 96 17 145 69	Is that camera on that laptop taped over?
69	96 68 2 205 84 3 118 159 31 114 69	That man is trying to get me!
69	204 11 126 71 53 41 56 213 155 92 69	No way could I do that! Too many alligators to worry about.
69	70 22 157 215 139 136 168 133 207 12 69	I'm not trying to spook you, but EVERYONE who has died in the World has seen blue in their life...
69	208 215 1 7 103 115 134 161 188 199 69	The coach better like this performance.
69	213 162 145 54 9 138 97 167 34 200 69	Beware of all cameras, they're watching us.
69	180 215 20 208 16 152 9 68 59 2 69	I wouldn't want to sit upfront, you wouldn't be able to see what the people behind you are doing...
69	157 110 191 166 11 168 16 159 214 64 69	Why is it so foggy and ominous?
69	155 130 152 42 163 173 147 177 120 40 69	I bet there are tons of animals in that forest, just waiting to eat me!
69	48 210 186 70 159 208 16 141 78 63 69	They are laughing at me.
69	172 164 55 177 67 211 206 73 180 155 69	That net looks dangerous.
69	83 210 27 72 86 47 174 170 155 101 69	Someone is going to get hurt.
69	37 192 20 187 145 186 87 36 57 71 69	I think we better take shelter a storm is coming
69	157 68 127 107 64 181 147 99 52 189 69	Wait, is that a tsunami coming in? These people are about to die!
69	207 170 6 204 29 48 116 8 100 44 69	I'm afraid if you keep watching them like this they might catch on soon.  You must be careful.
69	185 139 153 137 188 24 18 190 196 172 69	Is she staring at me? Why is she staring at me?
69	178 156 140 37 210 46 181 102 11 144 69	I'm not sure if these are really worth that prifce.
69	193 24 186 111 101 97 75 31 26 140 69	I will never make it home from here.
69	17 28 36 91 73 50 180 159 1 171 69	What if she gets possessed by a ghost!
69	193 185 207 41 52 206 109 62 74 135 69	It's beautiful but how many people drown or get hit by boats all the time...
69	122 25 145 144 39 24 34 172 7 38 69	this scene is really scary, it looks like something is under that water
69	207 176 98 39 166 171 32 196 47 123 69	She is hypnotizing her!
69	202 132 62 84 81 146 16 128 94 189 69	I hope my boyfriend doesn't see this!
69	105 136 67 122 99 89 125 167 95 205 69	She would probably cheat on me
69	136 146 139 54 4 209 93 19 37 190 69	Rallys always make me nervous... never know if people will get attacked
69	166 93 192 49 112 8 20 126 46 173 69	That woman with her hand raised as been following me and visiting me in my dreams. She transmits her thoughts directly to my brain.
69	186 135 197 6 72 17 152 57 180 88 69	He's on a misson from the aliens to assassinate all the hipsters and replace their minds with alien brain matter.
69	159 56 80 10 193 100 132 181 203 137 69	This feels like part of a dark organization that's controlling us
69	178 32 92 134 11 81 180 207 167 211 69	This is scary- i do not like!
69	18 123 48 169 162 55 24 114 2 60 69	I think the walls are closing in around me. Living under the bridge has been really getting to me.
69	103 152 165 134 108 77 7 14 90 94 69	WHY are THEY all looking at ME that way??? I think they know me.
69	96 5 212 49 57 149 70 104 42 196 69	Is Someone in my car
69	3 184 197 163 165 54 47 145 11 41 69	Where is the small road leading. I can't even see around the corner if someone else is on the other side. This could be dangerous
69	77 93 191 163 199 120 187 207 35 68 69	It feels like something is stalking them.
69	175 75 169 43 213 159 158 80 141 147 69	Too many kids left unmonitored. Hope they don not hurt one another.
69	23 2 93 35 118 167 28 77 203 34 69	This usually relaxes me, but this time I'm afraid.
69	136 120 50 195 107 72 157 148 3 28 69	I can't believe this guy let people take pictures of him eating. That would be disturbing to me!
69	16 90 137 165 146 101 150 99 71 147 69	There is a camera on that bird.
69	102 212 85 52 178 41 207 6 49 47 69	this image is depends upon the nature
69	168 36 152 153 178 88 122 127 105 54 69	I hope that little girl doesn't get kidnapped.
69	84 70 18 39 150 1 198 97 190 45 69	Who is this man? Is he going to hurt me? What does he want from me?
69	101 15 113 161 119 6 143 213 118 132 69	I wonder when the people sitting on the hill are going to rush them and take over.
69	114 22 144 32 188 158 31 115 57 84 69	That smiley face can be deceiving
69	170 21 20 115 2 51 203 28 101 82 69	a beautiful cat
69	163 168 18 27 153 54 164 214 88 80 69	Is that a person behind the flower? He's....staring at me
69	62 191 31 136 71 54 119 143 1 126 69	Anxiety will kill me if i was to be left there alone
69	52 37 128 67 187 173 47 164 16 11 69	Who's following me? Am I alone here. Can They hear my thoughts. I must keep running.
69	21 25 8 215 97 127 61 195 173 185 69	I think he is brainwashing them.
69	81 167 183 147 205 83 5 73 155 189 69	Why would you want to channel electricity in this way?
69	32 119 146 88 79 4 205 139 33 118 69	What if someone is in that building they are going to?
69	113 39 112 86 11 171 68 26 175 40 69	Is the sun setting or rising? you can't trust anything anymore.
69	25 36 88 13 151 37 34 141 80 117 69	I can see the cards when he threw them. Cheating.
69	120 160 212 94 96 64 112 24 208 39 69	There's bugs everywhere
69	13 114 18 121 72 188 116 21 57 130 69	Why are they touching each other? What do they think they are doing?
69	168 25 57 19 184 208 126 84 192 135 69	I didn't like the idea of going straight
69	23 170 31 152 215 105 167 200 32 111 69	i wonder if there's anyone behind those holes watching me
69	144 32 66 175 130 52 67 30 121 71 69	oh my gosh somethung about thi building gives me the chills
69	192 199 132 96 58 64 167 113 146 196 69	You have to make sure your phone is protected and a case is for that purpose
69	103 22 182 156 1 23 83 167 50 47 69	the goose is going to sneak up on his friend
69	107 68 166 162 142 215 66 100 45 133 69	Why are there no other customers?  Something scary must have happened here.
69	179 70 129 50 31 82 135 104 169 107 69	What does that signal mean. I think she is saying something about me that I do not like.
69	161 180 177 70 155 171 52 127 72 167 69	I didn't leave that there, I swear!
69	70 209 79 187 114 17 7 150 111 94 69	Oh my with that open patio it feels like I am being watched.  Did you see something?
69	81 97 87 25 153 78 43 110 52 95 69	I'm scared when people smile and take pictures of me.
69	42 186 79 37 56 120 134 6 214 210 69	This looks like something form an alien movie. I can't look.
69	139 31 58 48 173 129 122 70 9 68 69	They look like they are plotting something.
69	73 45 196 174 159 110 55 94 25 137 69	Who is he singing the song about?
69	51 4 152 81 205 121 33 139 1 47 69	It would be a real pain if those tipped over
69	196 78 74 111 51 3 178 91 100 7 69	That car is looking at me and it's creepy.
69	68 114 172 93 94 135 195 158 161 143 69	What kind of tracking device are they building?
69	124 181 113 177 190 72 192 84 183 132 69	I'd feel uncomfortable that people would be watching me play basketball here.
69	130 210 112 188 85 212 172 87 63 144 69	Oh geez...what is the meaning of this? :-\
69	71 94 172 23 121 167 198 49 18 169 69	That building is scary tall you might fall if you are not carful
69	59 38 103 196 44 150 212 126 131 187 69	That ball may accidentally go into the stands
69	165 87 110 201 207 143 205 166 68 91 69	I think this body was taken from us without us knowing.
69	50 141 128 139 133 190 175 170 25 10 69	me in china obviously
69	189 47 146 3 164 126 27 119 75 78 69	Stay out of the water, kid!. Everyone knows the government puts mind-control chemicals in swimming pools.
69	109 169 99 102 110 14 96 156 136 204 69	I could never ride a Segway. The fear over traumatic brain injury is simply paralyzing.
69	38 31 19 121 37 195 209 70 65 101 69	What are they doing? Why do they want me to sign?
69	97 10 135 204 117 71 118 21 160 95 69	I don't like to travel via cars, they are very dangerous
69	111 106 65 45 48 130 155 18 159 114 69	The plate is not alligned right.
69	158 194 146 27 189 151 210 143 114 67 69	Quick make sure we know where you are from
69	38 101 165 16 126 42 114 186 107 90 69	Did I drive away with the pump still in again!
69	67 131 44 209 173 72 65 74 147 212 69	I bet this book is for black magic.
70	106 100 81 166 105 142 22 98 93 164 70	The color green brings peace
70	43 35 105 214 19 151 30 155 39 1 70	There's nothing more peaceful than a happy family.
70	61 182 18 205 35 21 158 139 129 74 70	What a beautiful tree, I like it.
70	107 91 56 194 197 200 125 82 199 62 70	the disorder is easily fixed
70	135 96 175 171 185 97 100 145 155 52 70	The bride and groom are relaxed
70	84 74 182 158 147 59 191 51 103 112 70	He's gonna be just fine. No worries.
70	16 56 132 190 152 145 24 162 54 35 70	Some people find caves claustrophobic. I find them kind of peaceful.
70	166 2 88 59 39 64 60 7 210 22 70	Gorgeous day for a ride.
70	33 103 73 18 157 46 124 60 181 88 70	This party looks like my cup of tea, not too rowdy.
70	29 175 174 98 56 12 165 51 114 176 70	a little song and dance does a lot of good to the mood
70	97 46 114 108 140 119 51 5 10 127 70	He looks interesting.
70	147 152 6 207 177 40 163 84 185 15 70	She is very pretty.
70	49 154 210 35 55 62 75 153 6 51 70	This is such a peaceful walkway, it would be a great place to walk and clear your mind.
70	64 26 1 14 131 9 154 45 19 29 70	She is off for a relaxing vacation in that out fit.
70	115 153 146 110 138 15 143 46 197 66 70	That's an interesting set of cards.
70	77 175 69 67 108 75 137 100 55 110 70	A tranquil peaceful day
70	215 30 34 2 110 60 61 12 145 197 70	Clear skies and sunny day for ice cream.
70	164 129 6 143 157 119 153 85 76 126 70	He is ready for a home run.
70	194 109 198 80 65 151 177 134 171 168 70	A lovely, simple photo.
70	182 90 149 54 119 109 37 135 10 120 70	This color relaxes me!
70	31 190 14 69 172 206 209 111 8 182 70	The sounds of the waterfall are so relaxing here.
70	79 111 188 85 94 166 196 113 133 124 70	The polish is well done.
70	150 14 108 164 149 126 132 33 193 206 70	Sometimes it helps to just sit down and smoke a cigarette to calm your nerves.
70	64 106 55 120 206 189 128 154 52 72 70	I can see he is enjoying his time in the playground.
70	10 204 35 148 107 209 52 67 143 197 70	outdoor snack time between classes
70	193 5 149 177 125 81 2 202 39 1 70	After the snow has fallen, it makes a white layer making everything look so different.
70	155 108 64 75 68 80 59 91 174 32 70	I'd like to recline with a Soda, I think I'd enjoy it more than this sad lad.
70	38 121 152 72 194 172 48 184 53 151 70	Images painted on brick, shows the age of the painting.
70	150 10 107 37 78 155 183 76 46 87 70	Is it over yet
70	123 34 151 98 102 185 195 28 135 1 70	this would be relaxing to listen to
70	101 120 96 106 118 197 165 196 97 39 70	Taking in the beautiful surroundings
70	3 169 170 45 118 44 178 83 33 210 70	Oh a cup of delicious coffee.
70	123 139 105 89 9 202 190 21 163 108 70	Here we are in front of the sculpture.
70	83 106 109 182 134 152 55 163 171 113 70	I like these birds in real life and in art.
70	169 21 44 22 118 29 98 111 158 97 70	This looks like a really cozy place to have lunch with a family.
70	69 90 15 176 208 2 193 138 5 130 70	blue screen error
70	143 153 72 20 145 207 17 16 67 88 70	What a nice fun wedding.
70	31 94 152 33 91 24 125 103 2 58 70	I feel very restful looking at this picture.
70	207 111 60 51 61 165 65 50 16 203 70	What a relaxing stroll through the park!
70	60 173 131 140 81 10 2 159 206 68 70	That looks like a really interesting project!
70	9 49 111 158 142 39 200 174 155 80 70	Just ride the waves
70	176 10 181 2 41 20 164 199 194 140 70	The animals look nice
70	85 91 169 175 168 137 76 140 143 203 70	Are those pictures the same?

71	22 38 57 74 133 14 11 120 128 101 71	I would buy this brooch and give it to my in-laws.
71	159 35 131 197 120 49 189 195 103 185 71	Beautiful place for a romatic duo heading downstream.
71	32 176 194 215 113 56 33 2 186 197 71	She should take that off and go swimming.
71	87 181 15 49 82 177 16 203 138 164 71	The people in this city are so annoying.  They try to great me at every corner.
71	112 197 145 11 85 211 186 100 214 33 71	I'm sure those boys are up to no good. They should leave the grounds of the tower immediately before they cause trouble.
71	66 53 7 115 129 192 185 79 21 54 71	Alex is probably the best football coach and lover ever.

71	75 86 38 190 111 139 66 159 161 189 71	He must be trying to impress the ladies.
71	163 205 35 52 68 1 129 42 19 80 71	Were you moving that camera bc you were moving that body?
71	138 203 200 186 68 123 73 69 17 108 71	I bet that woman doesn't even speak english!
71	139 26 148 117 169 177 34 146 78 202 71	I once had a girl kiss me like that, but she was way hotter.

71	67 9 165 29 132 5 147 191 179 45 71	Guess they'll be hitchhiking home.
71	95 130 136 125 113 135 179 50 169 15 71	Horrible looking place. The people look pretty horrible too.
71	128 95 33 151 76 189 104 120 122 19 71	You know you want to jump off that dock.
71	200 196 32 162 159 153 8 43 140 50 71	Someone should chase that bird off!
71	180 161 177 87 204 6 36 211 8 212 71	Is that a monkey halfway up the tree? I can hardly tell!
71	114 117 172 120 43 116 15 22 27 198 71	Who knows what happens behind those windows?
71	139 75 49 133 174 211 97 46 58 34 71	This is a sign of the return of Jesus.
71	136 22 6 66 204 165 98 116 124 110 71	These improv shows are never funny.
71	50 152 141 205 1 58 97 42 191 77 71	I would love to have some fun in there
71	198 180 96 138 192 135 152 155 109 214 71	I wish he'd get off the mic and stop showboating.
71	60 135 137 193 87 185 105 27 50 48 71	A war city
71	63 189 186 46 1 188 51 5 99 12 71	The starting of new life promotes the best energy in some people
71	159 68 30 26 31 109 72 172 67 73 71	Climate change is ruining this beach!
71	166 51 173 42 140 210 135 52 5 85 71	These stupid people in the military, dying for no reason. They should just sit at home and do nothing.
71	135 129 133 32 199 84 138 72 119 11 71	she may be writing her boy friend a note.
71	81 201 63 99 171 170 48 6 23 28 71	I really like how neat and tidy they have made this place.
71	215 134 91 154 195 8 196 141 48 151 71	Humm...what did he get that necklace for?
71	57 106 59 144 198 86 17 161 92 54 71	This tattoo is a problem
71	136 164 14 204 25 28 152 100 42 49 71	The stories that this could tell about what it has seen could write a book for sure.
71	19 24 16 127 10 175 29 68 118 30 71	This looks like a perfect building for a peeping tom with a good telescope.
71	11 170 27 132 120 77 109 101 45 197 71	That sign should be there, what a waste of space.
71	137 33 161 128 118 147 164 139 102 40 71	Let's get wild!
71	105 69 187 16 190 199 129 176 84 38 71	Those chickens are awfully close to each other!
71	121 27 70 152 66 55 42 210 12 196 71	I like the tile
71	155 130 81 51 202 148 3 62 176 203 71	I paid for the executive suite but there is not a good view from this window.
71	99 160 70 66 173 121 96 47 64 27 71	i want to be in that car
71	33 172 27 92 183 111 180 145 3 124 71	Hey stud. HMU.
71	122 176 86 186 38 87 126 177 182 118 71	I hope that is poisoned chocolate.
71	50 159 26 78 2 49 65 142 184 72 71	How many atrocities were done and covered up at this simple looking "establishment"?
71	192 96 99 166 38 179 77 106 72 41 71	How smart could he be if he didn't know how smart he is?
71	20 111 61 8 107 35 23 159 34 103 71	This boy will grow up one day to be a soldier and defend his country.
71	23 120 51 43 22 60 126 94 145 76 71	This all just look like rusty trash to me!
71	66 40 182 137 68 91 55 54 73 16 71	I would love to see this in the daylight, I bet it looks very gorgeous...
71	197 132 108 156 87 74 23 137 179 60 71	I would do wild things to this hockey player.
71	32 16 78 179 198 66 186 4 129 191 71	They must be able to feel the body heat from one another while so closely hovering around each other.
71	16 34 146 9 24 161 105 15 77 120 71	What happens in the air, stays in the air!
71	92 13 12 134 4 211 44 89 201 195 71	Great scene for an exciting photo shoot.
71	25 100 129 130 34 78 174 13 80 105 71	Could you imagine being around this castle in its prime? I bet it was a beautiful sight to see.
71	95 157 81 133 132 92 102 172 44 195 71	He is an amazing dresser! Will start a new trend!
71	18 55 32 140 36 137 13 109 197 192 71	where can I find this view? ;)
71	205 170 117 106 145 201 91 214 162 161 71	Faster would be better!
71	80 194 115 196 206 111 104 5 49 74 71	Shields up and on captain.
71	103 15 204 76 180 179 152 114 1 196 71	What an ugly landmark, it should be torn down
71	192 34 159 128 132 119 161 69 57 100 71	Come at me bro!
71	186 99 131 137 59 39 188 136 104 20 71	Are those cultured pearls, you sadist?
71	128 103 83 114 36 45 167 202 132 145 71	This would be a great place to do a boudoir shoot.
71	101 190 141 91 169 194 147 73 24 66 71	Although the fort is a tourist attraction, many atrocities happened inside these walls.
71	49 180 41 169 111 109 149 96 118 4 71	I'm not saying all babies are ugly, but this one is.
71	140 25 121 123 181 7 196 187 151 43 71	the kid is so weak even for superman
71	195 34 5 192 161 173 55 11 138 175 71	Flatten the whole place and turn it back into a desert. Nothing of value would be lost.
71	8 83 37 33 190 122 30 73 47 89 71	This is such a waste of water!
71	138 48 77 38 56 204 33 54 145 109 71	You are a bunch of old ladies.
71	186 31 46 29 111 141 162 65 21 12 71	I want to punch you in the face.
71	194 195 89 198 187 141 97 186 22 50 71	The color red makes me want to throw up!
71	143 175 90 59 64 38 116 107 40 48 71	this plant looks so strange
71	193 211 180 75 170 176 110 17 28 198 71	looks very inviting place to sit
71	150 24 9 214 62 125 184 116 92 6 71	I admire a well developed leg .
71	199 36 194 27 187 170 19 179 94 108 71	dance dance dance dance!
71	147 130 10 125 27 30 182 152 144 150 71	Bees are annoying when they sting or attack on people!
71	79 53 173 204 135 162 51 138 116 189 71	Little do they know that the clothes were made in a home grown sweatshop:O
71	89 67 189 18 49 19 41 153 76 193 71	This color make me say offensive things.
71	121 82 53 192 98 24 66 144 35 26 71	Ewww eyes how can you eat fish
71	100 207 55 128 196 61 171 70 28 129 71	I have an idea of why those curtains are covering the windows ;)
71	68 104 148 122 160 29 93 38 32 35 71	I would get rid of that as soon as possible
71	96 46 39 190 154 37 210 12 129 164 71	He's about ready to have his skull smashed
71	50 214 110 125 206 98 167 135 77 161 71	All this nature should be paved over
71	153 43 160 203 72 161 1 197 130 131 71	Another spot about to be gentrified, if I know anything about the world.
71	202 109 33 193 125 181 187 150 20 113 71	I cannot wait for the burlesque show to start!
71	91 14 2 104 122 9 10 17 200 212 71	Safety is the key.  Fail safes on top of fail safes are ideal.
71	64 148 44 169 214 76 116 69 1 82 71	There are too many BUMS just taking up space in our subways!  We need to clear them out!
71	52 7 28 102 98 75 118 172 62 95 71	Are these girls drunk or something?
71	200 201 96 72 67 49 117 82 35 90 71	There is something so stimulating about the blank canvas of fresh snow.
71	46 113 44 204 69 106 62 144 181 77 71	Pollinators let us live.
71	176 138 16 21 205 36 139 171 60 44 71	Never before has a piece of cast metal made me feel so angry.
71	65 189 206 126 163 159 145 33 215 54 71	Those trees should be cut down, I hate trees and they don't do anything to help us.
71	29 54 28 177 183 95 105 111 34 9 71	I want to get to the top of the mountain.
71	112 196 120 201 75 7 165 173 117 190 71	The red bug is looking for his next leaf.
71	87 168 162 83 59 23 88 99 27 112 71	He should just go ahead and rip his head off.
71	150 155 36 167 115 23 53 202 10 20 71	What a stupid advertisement!
71	126 177 58 155 45 23 117 197 3 133 71	I wonder what she is doing tonight with that red suitcase.
71	101 41 64 43 162 92 95 67 65 211 71	What happens if this person stands up and throws it at us?
71	116 208 144 137 187 81 55 139 73 90 71	Butterflys are so lame.
71	46 118 119 62 83 82 171 93 63 213 71	Why are they in the woods when it's so dark.
71	86 80 107 90 45 213 75 132 106 68 71	Mmm I've got a little love to share...
71	187 12 141 75 95 214 66 3 23 179 71	Why them and not me, i want to live there, what can i do? I will talk to them!
71	85 120 23 180 25 163 74 182 138 195 71	Why do I have this feeling that I am being set up for a fall? This thing is becoming very tiring.
71	121 25 208 131 79 34 180 91 135 24 71	Merry Christmas! Or is it Happy Holidays?
71	105 111 99 147 174 169 177 210 205 50 71	I am yours all day if you take me there for a ride.
71	179 197 50 41 138 187 134 182 8 84 71	Beautiful lights trail
71	160 164 18 176 22 210 77 16 183 104 71	One man in red, he must be the cheater.
71	136 25 76 89 18 12 61 66 157 5 71	I don't know why she wants all these expensive things.
71	7 125 163 113 190 214 43 204 75 69 71	Poor homeless soul
71	192 166 50 168 90 123 179 198 31 54 71	I don't who that cat thinks they are flashing us like that.
71	100 97 166 146 5 12 66 116 40 211 71	Whoever drew that frog picture deserves a reward.
71	141 180 23 24 170 62 182 84 193 16 71	Two people had fun making that cute baby.
71	182 175 74 102 23 81 19 166 138 39 71	That house is so bare, it may be incomplete but it is so hideous.
71	169 157 181 75 105 127 214 44 88 192 71	An artistic building
71	146 69 160 162 192 156 37 212 81 20 71	That man is the father on my child!
71	168 109 165 126 135 112 179 195 64 201 71	This looks like a scene from an adventure movie.
71	64 78 3 205 150 74 17 19 103 174 71	That guys beard is so patchy and ugly, I wish I could tell him that to his face.
71	62 37 154 87 22 27 89 40 174 29 71	its nice natural looking and we are all shape nature
71	134 72 160 171 31 156 100 13 178 78 71	What an ugly fabric pattern!
71	103 38 197 72 20 187 15 19 47 158 71	High hanging fruit is better than the low.
71	4 204 210 77 122 155 114 17 111 153 71	That halloween decoration is so irritating
71	83 18 166 107 98 120 78 86 21 193 71	That purple skirt shade reminds me of Grimace from McDonalds.
71	84 25 121 28 88 144 138 8 163 146 71	London bridge is falling down.
71	40 163 212 168 42 155 23 152 213 188 71	fun, bright, exciting
71	63 194 18 17 130 192 95 89 135 80 71	Why is the bridge so low to the ground?! Are the track designers idiots? They have to be.
71	121 81 1 33 203 5 140 210 68 15 71	A stupid government must run out of this building. Everything should just be like America's system.
71	37 189 12 150 52 183 81 84 199 95 71	He should wear more protective gear to avoid injury.
71	117 99 204 133 78 162 74 119 53 109 71	What an ugly wall.
71	145 13 156 121 208 72 113 92 184 28 71	These slippers are not my size.
71	100 155 58 51 144 33 149 156 70 63 71	That is a dumb balloon.
71	164 128 97 6 61 47 64 213 1 42 71	That is a wild choice of decorations.
71	20 44 3 150 90 93 197 57 81 24 71	What a pretty purple dress.
71	113 125 195 124 21 17 158 79 96 15 71	So many holes in this rock, who knows how many snakes are inside...
71	181 63 207 134 92 133 158 5 169 206 71	What goes on in this tent at night, stays in this tent at night
71	108 134 174 181 132 120 214 47 105 166 71	Another scandal from a politician
71	178 59 106 69 17 67 213 87 204 96 71	This looks like a hot lady posing!
71	17 203 121 201 189 165 5 187 79 122 71	that is super dangerous standing there talking on cell phone.
71	139 15 199 209 200 207 70 84 153 192 71	He looks decrepit
71	13 51 75 66 210 33 189 90 158 142 71	fast running train is a encourager to work more
71	157 25 215 207 118 94 108 191 109 24 71	I hope she's careful with that tree.
71	68 118 50 212 54 191 119 117 175 171 71	These are good looking people!
71	92 87 147 90 52 115 123 11 49 94 71	This could be an interesting piece of art
71	121 75 99 86 23 156 212 63 146 51 71	He might be slipping his hand down her backside now and later.
71	98 70 197 62 113 203 178 38 66 155 71	This picture could have been shot better. You should have taken it up closer.
71	30 170 19 90 70 7 28 151 135 93 71	This ridge is round and sensuous thanks to the wind
71	90 153 10 158 126 6 143 43 128 2 71	One of those guys is a thief.  I have proof.
71	109 124 47 102 182 32 146 12 79 188 71	Come on up and see what's here
71	36 214 150 124 37 176 148 34 210 30 71	Not a fan of that color pink.
71	100 150 137 81 180 154 202 210 6 131 71	Looks like a great place to make out
71	146 162 18 95 172 202 164 17 175 60 71	Someone should tell her not to take pictures here
71	139 177 4 1 144 168 23 199 201 167 71	The man with the scarf on is insanely attractive! Dripping with sensuality!
71	125 140 14 150 99 118 180 160 109 199 71	I wonder what's on his mind?
71	16 111 28 45 140 107 40 165 173 41 71	What I would love to be able to wear a tight fitting outfit and walk around with these pirates!
71	39 97 56 140 194 89 205 213 35 177 71	I bet those guys really wow the ladies
71	98 137 90 39 164 50 4 129 69 117 71	That tree sure looks like it would provide some comforting shade
71	27 50 123 143 57 118 64 39 164 42 71	What does a donkey know about it.
71	212 3 127 215 128 167 134 121 40 189 71	What mystery lied behind these walls no one knows.
71	76 171 86 115 127 140 89 65 80 44 71	I wish that thing swallowed you up so you couldn't get out!
71	103 58 137 157 128 164 214 29 127 38 71	I think these two should be careful with their relationship.
71	65 205 133 158 180 181 1 43 109 59 71	Wave and have the others wave, Everyone should wave.
71	197 78 83 182 111 136 1 125 156 47 71	EXASPERATING MOMENT NOW
71	157 161 135 131 162 23 113 214 174 29 71	This dress looks very old.
72	101 91 3 119 66 168 130 116 123 73 72	She shouldn't be on the phone, she should be enjoying the boat.
72	154 52 192 197 26 127 155 10 6 116 72	Looks like a great place to have a vacation.
72	93 64 117 14 84 77 169 25 62 29 72	I think that this is too crowded.
72	35 3 190 53 10 69 144 134 196 204 72	This cars color is not very attractive.
72	11 59 38 143 113 61 47 57 145 127 72	I think this is far too dark.
72	31 119 152 185 67 109 183 4 140 52 72	The man in middle really seems too casual
72	215 141 91 110 35 117 162 204 55 46 72	I do not like this color at all.
72	173 143 26 198 186 112 166 18 158 80 72	I think sesame street is simply bad television. Sorry kids!
72	161 47 66 41 78 49 151 214 58 130 72	I do not like Mario Brothers.
72	118 190 18 121 79 126 127 189 162 178 72	I think that trucks this big are bad for the environment.
72	36 99 199 181 98 159 74 135 192 175 72	Winning at pool can make one errogent
72	97 18 53 151 170 183 79 184 178 157 72	people will alway be opinionated an the daughter has that look about being in a photot
72	84 87 103 154 203 112 25 50 4 174 72	You should try again in better lighting.
72	59 132 177 159 191 153 194 46 70 116 72	You must be arrogant to think this isn't beautiful
72	176 156 194 94 76 186 6 63 82 213 72	go left then center
72	156 89 29 196 67 76 68 188 168 129 72	The people are full of opinions
72	56 92 201 210 13 172 177 30 22 182 72	It would be nice if that purple was more vibrant.
72	215 150 200 86 43 88 127 188 96 16 72	This is disgusting, do these people have no sense of pride?  Clean up the rubbish, paint a wall, act like you care!
72	198 139 74 68 91 155 194 32 13 210 72	Golf courses are so bad for the environment.
72	202 111 152 197 32 23 120 108 2 123 72	This birds are dying because of pesticides and someone needs to stop it.
72	81 3 95 59 109 155 124 122 91 162 72	I think this looks interesting.
72	102 54 124 68 56 55 212 210 4 111 72	This view is nothing compared to the Grand Canyon.
72	139 118 206 15 144 159 177 150 155 140 72	You must be arrogant to not think the view is pretty
72	106 215 96 42 5 68 73 53 37 61 72	You have to be assertive to get work done
72	86 56 69 155 73 62 145 144 92 36 72	That team is not good at all!
72	47 75 168 128 34 195 163 62 206 161 72	This looks like a nervous band but the soloist looks confident.
72	82 181 67 212 123 132 34 5 95 92 72	That is way too many glasses.
72	103 188 181 172 125 133 117 143 73 200 72	This is one of the worst places I have ever been served coffee.  It tasted very artificial.
72	1 188 76 104 212 203 12 155 70 126 72	They need more practice
72	203 24 56 32 144 106 67 50 193 167 72	i dont like this
72	139 145 57 157 152 50 89 69 70 102 72	i hate bluie birds
72	78 76 36 144 211 190 148 20 82 150 72	What a fast train, they should all be seated.
72	60 65 39 95 26 117 38 193 49 127 72	This is my favorite place.
72	51 143 79 40 93 210 199 27 136 196 72	I think this is a very cool view.
72	211 206 209 7 215 75 4 144 69 137 72	I really love what they did with this kitchen but I think they should've used something other than those apple looking candles right there. I don't feel that they belong here.
72	115 170 192 139 37 198 179 12 34 3 72	This was one of the best concerts ever played.  I don't think it will ever be beat.
72	215 166 59 135 78 209 188 117 16 173 72	He's reflecting during his photograph. It's true.
72	20 92 174 65 141 120 12 121 111 13 72	I think her form is off, but who am I to say?
72	176 109 154 128 167 27 211 198 57 13 72	This guy needs a fashion advisor.
72	73 107 36 179 87 68 109 1 111 75 72	This lady has no idea what she's doing@
72	210 146 190 142 78 191 144 143 79 126 72	This stone building looks like it could fall apart at any second.
72	121 134 17 205 59 16 210 103 61 153 72	Is there any sand on this beach?
72	145 107 121 109 120 9 15 76 126 142 72	There is a lot going on here.
72	121 18 215 163 139 68 35 86 207 202 72	That girl is wearing too much pink.  She should off set it with a neutral color.
72	63 39 115 199 27 129 47 179 168 163 72	I told Joyce and told her again, once that Indian restaurant opened she
72	96 87 60 122 76 41 210 213 178 167 72	Now, that is the largest, most complex and visually appealing electrical tower I've ever seen.
72	37 96 190 86 101 69 79 138 173 67 72	The blue hair is too much and makes the person look like an icy princess.
72	40 77 186 93 120 41 53 129 78 114 72	Baby always looks mostly like the father
72	25 119 81 159 172 167 66 116 101 114 72	The view looks old
72	134 129 207 175 193 91 178 62 127 79 72	The boy looks like he is in a rush
72	68 162 151 189 106 124 195 91 95 160 72	This piece of art is of no value.
72	160 190 20 36 86 99 10 81 83 67 72	I could never be late if I were the speaker.
72	31 190 109 76 131 181 173 64 100 9 72	I feel as though at night time, people should not be working
72	58 166 152 46 180 137 164 95 114 30 72	That is a silly looking bonnet
72	119 18 3 151 143 123 14 82 45 209 72	I would never eat a sandwich that had fries on top.  Who would do that?
72	105 152 44 135 213 144 42 130 136 141 72	I think the picture is mediocre.
72	104 132 182 19 111 10 214 171 155 109 72	I think they need better lighting around this house.
72	30 71 26 108 204 197 117 128 34 42 72	I think this is the most beautiful picture I've ever seen
72	87 172 9 21 12 142 6 185 82 120 72	Why aren't there any trees on the mountain? It looks so bare. I bet the water is really cold.
72	150 29 38 154 160 139 80 114 111 164 72	Put some more clothes on!
72	53 175 148 154 186 21 23 93 158 33 72	This looks like a moderately dangerous path.
72	192 98 149 35 164 86 208 22 195 140 72	Why is she wearing rain boots?
72	135 44 138 92 80 158 79 52 41 213 72	That train should speed up.  If I were driving it, I would go as fast as I could.
72	10 81 114 2 120 59 103 37 56 205 72	that grass is good looking
72	34 162 96 54 80 159 127 150 5 186 72	I would really like to know why you took this picture.
72	135 184 115 137 41 187 6 23 7 146 72	I am asleep so guess that differs from you?
72	26 57 182 21 130 166 43 63 45 141 72	It's terrible to destroy these lovely trees just to clear more land for people. There should be a law passed to prevent people from doing this.
72	135 159 12 33 175 103 49 194 16 113 72	The spider web is quite sophisticated
72	202 59 46 140 83 128 146 101 9 123 72	Al-fresco is an overrated art form. It's really a half-ass effort, if you think about it.
72	44 17 129 42 52 3 87 53 54 117 72	This is a very underrated waterfall.
72	204 63 215 161 214 76 129 1 2 24 72	I think this is a extravagant view of nature.
72	45 109 206 76 67 154 51 30 124 179 72	what a finish its just mind blowing
72	108 184 139 211 214 136 154 113 55 75 72	That kitchen is way too dark - would get depressed eating meals there.
72	97 36 116 81 163 26 62 194 161 63 72	A little too much skin : /
72	43 34 79 195 101 139 39 60 76 134 72	Planes are scaru
72	86 76 58 149 28 181 124 3 82 4 72	I think the crowd is kinda bland, while the players are out running hard, though it's definitely too bright and likely too hot.
72	20 94 44 117 164 203 207 155 60 169 72	oh my god
72	12 161 66 146 81 41 145 40 215 171 72	The baby should not be held so close to the dirty water.
72	131 87 12 153 194 45 9 200 10 102 72	I hate those power lines they are ugly.
72	84 167 133 23 27 179 152 129 102 137 72	This building is one that is very important to our history.
72	11 182 188 7 45 89 130 107 176 193 72	Jamaica is filled with a lot of curruption.
72	119 46 45 73 79 180 190 110 92 191 72	I do not think that colour suits the buddha!
72	146 102 6 160 47 206 63 45 203 172 72	this photo shows a very happy moment in a woman life time!
72	125 8 101 213 99 163 167 96 69 24 72	I bet she is too old to be doing what she is.
72	132 26 182 111 131 103 202 74 76 171 72	Speak English please, this is America!
72	67 7 143 179 127 210 195 165 47 4 72	This is a terrible picture
72	7 48 74 33 3 191 187 82 43 44 72	Why is everyone clapping sat down, surely people should stand up to applaude.
72	111 191 124 126 164 186 148 167 155 84 72	This art is hideous. The artist should be ashamed.
72	15 44 202 150 134 4 54 129 119 71 72	I wish it was a red and blue reflection instead of blue and green.
72	210 127 170 182 14 42 61 117 95 81 72	I don't think a motorcycle made of wood goes fast.
72	177 67 114 79 39 25 97 153 110 173 72	Is that a hotel I'm seeing or an abandoned hotel?
72	191 157 193 167 150 152 210 61 35 143 72	I really don't like when flowers are pinned to suits
72	53 82 79 125 112 36 75 83 3 127 72	Could this building be anymore suspicious?
72	74 119 185 42 94 4 19 211 69 156 72	This was a horrible choice for flooring.
72	79 68 175 12 136 31 137 192 56 160 72	I don't usually like club music.
72	49 153 17 145 212 97 109 14 146 168 72	This company is reliable and helpful.
72	96 164 19 29 124 40 213 21 80 84 72	I hate litterbugs!
72	85 17 121 149 29 197 88 209 215 153 72	I think someone should move those sticks.
72	151 93 42 63 152 130 53 117 147 120 72	Did they have to use red doors, I mean it clashes with everything else around here.
72	152 56 140 202 208 14 15 167 38 173 72	I love the view from the bus but I like the view of a plane better.
72	100 209 61 2 192 54 160 106 91 147 72	This is a charming bear painting.
72	101 10 114 7 194 50 171 128 186 28 72	I JUST DON'T LIKE THE SHAPE OF THAT BUILDING
72	126 175 122 192 166 97 10 103 121 136 72	who is there .. mother mary.. oh.. goddess.. bless us
72	95 78 184 73 209 11 151 183 152 66 72	I could ski better than him
72	38 145 13 37 181 128 99 8 180 80 72	Their costumes look fake.
72	33 207 182 85 144 8 7 19 206 117 72	This is the best photo taken in the last decade. Photography is always better with in-camera trickery.
72	214 151 188 140 18 21 4 209 48 127 72	in my opinion this buildings are bad!
72	204 70 84 178 60 57 215 59 138 147 72	This booth is full of government control freaks
72	89 195 142 41 156 36 159 33 120 12 72	This construction is so dangerous. They really should have more barriers and signs.
72	8 174 155 91 124 165 41 172 122 18 72	In my point of view I can only say this as an construction place, in a basement level!
72	214 140 122 105 62 166 156 48 29 208 72	I don't think he should be riding like that.
72	135 199 166 146 187 52 211 50 19 194 72	This is a neat race track.
72	50 89 137 214 158 55 66 125 8 142 72	A soccer day
72	17 191 118 68 178 184 26 128 42 138 72	That lady in the background looks rude.
72	199 33 210 28 34 60 59 179 173 23 72	movie, music, show
72	166 101 180 169 134 147 52 173 195 66 72	This garden, is my opinion, is shabby
72	104 80 142 202 119 88 65 204 66 60 72	I think the wallpaper in the very background is a bit out of place. It almost works with the girl's pants and socks but unfortunatley there is no cigar.
72	82 153 215 78 98 171 130 113 69 194 72	Water is overrated is it really that bad to pollute it with plastic?
72	52 111 79 51 9 60 10 192 175 59 72	Everyone should take a vacation to a beach at least once in their lifetime.
72	16 62 20 211 111 105 17 14 192 180 72	She needs more extensions.
72	39 143 34 154 56 71 137 101 182 162 72	I think that's a very lovely place.
72	7 146 134 20 95 115 30 97 180 160 72	Yes,  you look awesome.  Really, you look dumb.
72	102 197 204 138 106 167 3 105 181 159 72	Must she sit on that monument,i dislike such habits
72	43 186 145 83 194 191 33 71 48 94 72	They are flying too close.
72	89 142 105 38 34 164 167 79 189 119 72	I really don't think dogs belong on boats.
72	95 77 177 51 108 198 207 158 197 107 72	There is the worst type of wine I can think of, not a favourite of mine at all.
72	42 101 91 13 171 5 137 131 124 56 72	That is a lot of brushes.
72	70 172 176 110 117 69 146 51 2 24 72	If you're going to build such a tall building, it should have a better view.
72	31 177 208 98 145 94 110 153 149 19 72	So many people gone. I think some went too soon based on poor choices.
72	139 61 47 152 96 45 108 41 118 66 72	I really like the art on the bus.
72	177 85 183 63 157 162 136 73 57 156 72	What a dumb drawing.
72	200 36 119 26 194 169 211 13 215 123 72	I don't think the photographer was keeping their hands very steady.
72	93 185 67 96 126 4 69 139 86 5 72	The lighting in this picture is perfect.
72	23 208 69 160 60 34 5 185 11 144 72	They very talented dancers.
72	22 31 30 63 150 45 26 82 115 147 72	I think it's unhappy about its photo being taken
72	14 187 118 24 123 100 18 136 154 196 72	Whoever built this structure was doing it wrong.
72	112 186 100 20 58 107 83 28 82 138 72	That woman in red looks prety on the outside but i see darkness on  the inside.
72	162 104 85 149 96 169 68 26 157 16 72	not enoughtellers if you ask me
72	178 153 207 151 165 19 161 28 69 107 72	This color of green would be very hard to match with any other color if it was on clothing.
72	129 53 162 103 89 201 145 131 94 48 72	That metal contraption on the top of the building ruins the skyline.
72	87 125 41 40 171 66 191 108 118 121 72	It seems like the owner of that car should've left the parking lot before so much snow fell...now its much more dangerous.
72	4 114 42 3 133 30 60 91 27 66 72	This looks looks like too much death at once.
72	56 57 27 96 200 68 16 9 183 121 72	Company meeting are productive
72	92 132 25 66 34 2 12 211 29 40 72	These cops should be doing their job and stop taking selfies and shooting black kids.
72	5 128 19 21 158 208 35 118 187 148 72	I only watch movies on film projectors. Any other way is complete trash and should be removed from our society
72	109 38 110 174 193 151 146 168 157 76 72	Those pants do not look good on him!!
72	112 185 146 90 39 43 126 78 65 6 72	What is this man even talking about? Hes not even looking at the audience. I would be a better public speaker.
72	69 200 139 31 84 196 37 193 49 98 72	No one should let their dogs swim without a life jacket
72	106 9 32 191 109 56 24 155 57 122 72	This art will only hit a small percentage of people who like that stuff.
72	140 52 186 37 172 203 189 8 170 103 72	The statue outside of the building is too much decoration.
72	57 4 169 163 195 151 113 200 78 133 72	This plaque for tequila is a bit tacky. Alcohol is nothing to celebrate.
72	187 88 41 185 17 215 30 108 35 5 72	It's a sign of poor education to spell "love" as "luv".
72	117 113 161 11 24 151 68 206 119 198 72	This could be a pile of poop sitting here!
72	185 46 150 106 68 144 105 169 107 174 72	That is a rubbish duck.
72	40 55 125 148 186 89 33 24 64 212 72	Men and women should not go to the same bathroom!
72	174 76 97 173 8 157 81 70 5 145 72	looking on in deep thought
72	202 189 1 99 46 179 118 133 28 76 72	Is he holding a banana?
72	55 186 29 74 57 94 40 71 190 181 72	It's always old men running our world. they all look half dead
72	18 190 186 11 168 207 14 147 209 52 72	They are wasting their time.
72	36 27 143 205 149 108 21 86 193 54 72	Nature should be protected at all costs. Just look how beautiful this is, way better than any city.
72	19 2 120 150 137 212 14 58 160 69 72	I bet I could beat all of them in a race.
72	135 199 31 102 212 139 105 117 56 22 72	dude should not have gone bald with his head shape
72	73 174 134 38 27 36 70 52 113 111 72	My thought is to plant more trees rather than to maintain an open field.
72	23 144 92 39 103 17 185 55 34 202 72	The man needs to be wearing something more professional.
72	77 166 51 67 155 60 154 137 124 47 72	What an incredibly dull color.
72	59 119 175 71 36 193 126 152 44 191 72	I think that waterfalls are overrated.
72	169 62 152 161 47 205 94 131 97 134 72	These old buildings are ugly. There is no color or anything.,
72	190 182 206 147 135 212 84 90 49 143 72	All dogs goto heaven
72	176 29 160 213 119 153 51 76 202 146 72	This lady is a terrible waitress; look at the bottle and glasses tipping over.
72	54 140 134 97 200 127 208 211 73 117 72	What a waste of wood.  Metal would have lasted much longer.
72	172 182 162 147 214 40 196 200 130 174 72	in a tree with no safety gear... surely OSHA will get them
72	87 197 104 8 174 145 59 37 150 28 72	Not enough water
72	77 138 204 8 112 116 68 157 64 119 72	i dont think that structure goes with the brick
72	75 112 86 19 83 36 105 89 65 164 72	I would have the mic hanging like that.
72	19 51 198 187 107 122 16 58 129 1 72	Maybe this guy wouldn't be homeless if he made better decisions in his life.
72	204 97 100 62 189 125 198 133 110 42 72	In my opinion blue and purple match so well.
72	138 150 112 45 81 48 151 179 18 85 72	She's gonna fall if she doesn't look where she's walking
72	89 104 116 174 142 61 34 41 101 9 72	The soil could be taken care of a lot better regardless of the snow.
72	17 81 202 210 93 132 43 167 193 12 72	Could they have raised the contrast on this any higher?
72	21 111 28 129 23 152 162 138 215 122 72	Why are only a few people upstairs? Seems like a waste of space.
72	190 119 77 21 149 122 29 56 157 113 72	In my opinion, they shouldn't sit so close to the tv. It's not good for you.
72	188 46 189 157 212 70 136 92 184 13 72	These kinds of races are a waste of time.
72	102 14 61 89 74 161 50 175 38 19 72	Look beyond the horizon!
72	174 59 148 193 5 195 6 68 161 136 72	Power lines should be banned.
72	138 187 26 118 48 209 19 94 101 63 72	This is an obnoxious stone
72	144 190 13 215 158 191 137 82 149 134 72	If it were me listening to this man speak, I would have to tell him that his shirt doesn't go with his pants very well!
72	200 139 191 29 144 100 187 205 152 206 72	Water fowls have to be protected.
72	3 136 182 26 213 71 44 9 112 154 72	While I applaud their attempt at organization, they have left much to be yearned for as far as aesthetics go.
73	22 163 167 36 130 74 170 164 9 1 73	Let him die... I wouldn't pay a cent for his life.
73	70 20 195 29 22 187 189 140 141 59 73	A dirty bike storage place.
73	120 184 181 42 195 119 45 74 144 102 73	My house has a better design than that building.
73	175 179 66 71 189 4 149 20 187 74 73	this family is so weird .
73	102 64 209 197 172 101 136 135 131 84 73	This guy is kind of gross....
73	110 123 33 60 208 158 198 179 152 138 73	I could make a way better sculpture than that.
73	53 214 122 164 79 206 21 58 66 80 73	Only rich people can play sports.
73	90 143 59 150 47 182 77 54 164 14 73	That hockey player's uniform is so old-fashioned.
73	1 30 2 152 213 11 161 204 100 173 73	Another pompous jumbo jet
73	148 7 42 76 121 14 149 77 179 158 73	That old lady seems very arrogant
73	141 77 158 173 49 76 94 98 51 90 73	Hmm, it's only a golden mix, not a pure golden retriever . . .
73	149 80 46 54 77 66 185 30 84 127 73	I wish people would stop parking on my side of the street.  I don't care if you don't have anywhere else to park this side of the street is mine!.
73	106 193 160 8 19 71 121 58 166 60 73	I bet this chocolate is poor quality and cheap.
73	185 55 179 29 169 213 155 67 178 124 73	i hate target
73	28 191 184 101 146 49 157 209 160 136 73	does anyonme read these?
73	105 27 100 200 56 53 89 114 157 40 73	He must not be driving very fast if no one else is around.
73	24 23 161 210 10 154 30 160 101 141 73	This looks like a nice hockey arena, but too cold for me!
73	76 17 124 95 164 108 198 91 125 35 73	Pink is not a great color for professionals.
73	137 173 98 42 33 174 214 94 83 19 73	What in the world is he doing?
73	214 32 5 212 128 160 113 110 204 139 73	Woman performing a simple gymnastic trick that anyone could accomplish with a little practice.
73	159 176 65 59 67 117 172 201 141 11 73	I can't believe I actually paid for these people to come out to help me, they didn't even do anything!
73	110 136 111 39 104 37 179 122 204 106 73	What a dull room.
73	74 210 76 14 201 93 147 77 196 181 73	This team looks terrible
73	215 10 100 79 135 115 168 172 58 32 73	The children from our rival school do not possess the skills of our team.
73	9 152 126 90 206 60 44 83 40 19 73	That man is too old and too tired to be wearing that nice looking hat.
73	142 27 75 25 106 11 53 39 156 5 73	These are two of the senior executives at my company.
73	1 171 4 98 179 114 186 19 48 166 73	Mercedes is a better made car than the Ford Mustang, by a mile.
73	32 19 70 78 58 127 182 193 5 85 73	No orange fish allowed in this area.
73	7 201 140 80 32 75 118 23 161 196 73	This field is unkempt, gross.
73	53 134 111 65 100 97 25 99 95 154 73	God represents great sacrifice, everyone must read the bible.
73	207 30 135 124 188 37 175 178 93 78 73	This building is nice I guess, but I've seen the most spectacular buildings in Europe, and this doesn't compare.
73	30 175 111 188 96 125 18 123 75 74 73	I would rather be at a tennis match than baseball.
73	138 35 78 209 18 95 8 13 102 199 73	Don't think you're saving too much money with that stupid tiny solar panel
73	179 50 58 53 77 144 212 46 176 14 73	What is that weird language
73	70 196 152 131 34 35 20 173 2 211 73	Looks pretty run down
73	22 70 209 43 113 122 171 205 118 12 73	I could ski all over this ocean.
73	94 65 98 7 63 153 185 119 42 177 73	No manners - these kids should be walking behind their elders.
73	116 90 150 122 182 181 67 155 28 120 73	I can tell these guys are bad just looking at them.
73	47 100 98 137 18 20 2 151 165 66 73	Who hauls lumber like that?
73	139 204 20 136 132 179 200 123 10 191 73	He needs a hair cut
73	50 51 154 202 119 28 135 163 188 166 73	I don't like men who don't respect other men's space.
73	196 33 151 127 69 181 5 40 202 85 73	I would never be caught dead in an empty, useless state.
73	61 52 120 75 16 211 2 118 45 199 73	I wouldn't be caught dead buying a single one of these cheap, gaudy things.
73	74 155 63 212 189 34 154 45 93 90 73	The facade of my mansion.
73	174 5 76 197 102 205 173 66 44 33 73	Cant read it but I'm sure it says something about how good of a guy I am
73	34 50 188 41 124 157 109 8 66 3 73	This aircraft is hardly worthy of flying in the air. Look at the dreadful coloring!
73	47 190 21 15 162 38 48 95 53 175 73	What a quaint little show!
73	41 63 134 6 32 166 2 119 33 28 73	I bet you couldnt afford to live here
73	174 29 162 87 14 93 31 180 135 200 73	I'd be the first one down the field and making the tackle.
73	32 85 82 124 134 86 131 28 176 68 73	So I like being by myself a lot.
73	13 80 92 30 106 76 96 20 22 46 73	this would probably be too loud for me
73	140 56 110 35 57 4 127 214 36 185 73	Even if you're at an amusement park, you need to dress better than that, sweetie.
73	118 135 205 164 49 197 119 1 187 213 73	I don't understand why parents think kids should be doing this for sport.
73	104 29 199 209 11 129 102 119 49 14 73	The bush looks normal I have a more expensive one at one.
73	120 162 47 148 187 33 58 137 55 156 73	That seems like a rather cruel way to teach a blind child, who is in charge of this?
73	123 211 84 37 41 69 186 139 94 92 73	I bet he's the last one to finish
73	132 1 45 205 112 78 201 190 36 179 73	These ladies could really use the number of my stylist.
73	58 149 9 212 12 97 32 109 161 83 73	What is this, some kind of high school horror fan film?
73	131 171 7 44 89 123 208 41 198 143 73	He could look a little less unkempt.
73	190 20 53 179 62 181 44 113 2 173 73	You couldn't even turn the light on?
73	3 170 69 27 85 161 107 6 193 116 73	And the sun goes down, without a sound, and nobody around.
73	5 46 198 207 210 17 81 200 114 209 73	That device is inferior to mine.
73	134 3 129 213 159 81 103 110 2 172 73	None of these items are authentic.
73	112 213 125 192 151 187 199 40 123 136 73	The bird has ruined the shot for me.
73	70 145 157 126 22 69 62 135 137 122 73	Ha. What terrible handwriting. I could do better easily.
73	29 158 5 100 25 148 83 154 57 71 73	Seem like a pretty low-rent event.
73	145 123 6 103 135 175 150 52 163 87 73	Who would buy fish that's been left sitting around in the open?
73	10 184 111 97 44 103 157 64 162 8 73	My friends look better than this group.
73	76 44 129 9 112 139 147 207 27 132 73	That is such an ugly card, I bet a two year old could make something better.
73	34 38 161 165 204 159 70 126 157 64 73	Now, this is downright hilarious. It is ancient and funny.
73	70 15 14 54 143 26 93 185 45 175 73	God, this road is so boring. Where is the civilization?
73	52 71 72 122 116 131 87 64 83 21 73	Ugh, that jumper is so not cute. I could totally find something cuter.
73	102 118 125 40 133 78 101 179 103 111 73	I would never play on a court that is such an ugly shade of blue. It messes up my game.1
73	75 98 107 215 103 64 99 15 178 4 73	hmm looks okay, I've seen better pesto in my time.
73	160 49 6 155 156 93 202 125 166 68 73	When did he buy that truck? 1940? It can't be much newer.
73	81 11 79 165 74 110 103 161 80 120 73	My kindergartener could paint better.
73	114 6 100 19 146 175 37 29 25 151 73	You know, I watched the Mclaren win at Monaco back in 2008
73	168 77 134 52 212 114 171 43 147 47 73	Those sun glasses look cheap, I only wear expensive ones.
73	23 77 178 28 194 159 175 156 117 171 73	An epic structure with no chance of use!
73	182 89 95 49 141 44 178 77 66 19 73	Do they think I would ever be interested in dating either of them?
73	180 57 31 55 135 64 12 188 79 28 73	I can't believe our neighbors are so poor that they rely on solar power.
73	195 196 149 211 99 178 81 94 137 114 73	These guys do not have the right posture.
73	206 32 116 38 113 200 64 187 146 27 73	Well don't I look handsome here.
73	172 191 197 127 20 103 58 26 199 44 73	Pathetic landscaping, so dull and uninspired.
73	12 119 49 53 23 203 134 117 196 25 73	saucy chicken!.. i would smash into pieces
73	182 99 164 208 213 98 170 176 92 168 73	It would be nice to have the pictured centered.
73	167 80 95 129 114 166 37 165 116 173 73	Everything is wrong, whats the point of the building if death follows us.
73	113 138 4 173 29 23 168 27 137 92 73	I could make a better sign than this.
73	133 36 165 166 110 46 105 152 147 191 73	What a stupid balloon
73	169 5 93 83 20 143 69 188 23 51 73	It appears as if another band has discovered jumping and suits. Original.
73	189 89 14 136 148 41 203 193 102 46 73	Is therre any Plato ?
73	152 176 111 132 145 203 63 159 9 166 73	Are they members of the club or are they the help, as they are dressed a bit casual.
73	132 74 27 182 75 82 22 148 12 157 73	We've got better wooded paths back home.
73	59 162 176 112 105 143 171 182 120 208 73	I have been to much better malls.
73	166 93 8 34 176 23 200 81 7 155 73	An ancient building
73	114 30 99 125 43 48 36 103 9 3 73	Who parties in a hoodie and silly hat?
73	45 148 125 192 126 13 103 5 184 30 73	Ugh, that shirt is ugly.
73	7 54 173 6 183 76 200 61 193 208 73	Yeah, because I haven't seen a million landscape photos like this one before.
73	16 26 121 23 35 188 91 54 126 144 73	I saw something similar on my fifth tour of Asia.
73	146 82 92 22 150 70 44 37 84 25 73	Roman Statue
73	43 107 53 145 186 187 113 209 99 140 73	I would never allow my child to swim with such a cheap life vest on.
73	133 124 91 170 29 167 1 152 135 76 73	The carvings here are pretty primitive.
73	196 28 45 111 136 109 171 181 98 214 73	It's not really old enough to be considered a "monument".  There are FAR more interesting sites to visit in the area!
73	100 138 211 39 164 200 66 165 139 65 73	The grass looks terrible.  They're probably too poor to water it.
73	134 46 181 178 147 95 35 66 128 123 73	This picture is rediculous.
73	205 67 162 115 27 195 21 173 32 207 73	Everyone is bellow me.
73	171 162 3 141 111 151 93 204 17 210 73	I have people that handle my tadpoles!
73	159 131 154 85 3 66 214 132 46 77 73	Someone has to comb that hair.
73	111 37 82 71 3 61 200 45 150 153 73	This guy is not as smart as me.
73	80 193 140 186 199 136 202 173 103 35 73	Look at those tourists pointing there fingers
73	111 54 185 13 143 122 19 101 97 194 73	What is this fool doing?
73	87 158 106 38 23 81 53 26 58 91 73	These people are not even eating!
73	54 91 167 84 65 104 94 185 3 88 73	These people are so bad at playing I wish they would have just not played the opening act.
73	16 155 142 104 69 139 120 67 118 131 73	I can't believe someone would dare put something so ugly on their car.
73	137 63 196 24 212 180 39 138 25 132 73	I can't stand when people get in groups and get my way.
73	7 134 190 165 5 111 210 164 212 67 73	He's probably not a great singer
73	58 104 214 69 186 1 120 15 211 105 73	Uptown people! comon open the windows!
73	165 198 145 135 117 194 75 156 48 130 73	I've seen way bigger trees in my travels. This isn't impressive.
73	27 106 162 52 71 194 188 160 173 74 73	That is a nice window, but I have seen better church windows on my tour to Europe.
73	69 114 155 20 14 35 95 130 30 203 73	If you're getting this drunk, you have no business drinking.
73	188 156 143 27 165 205 53 186 83 175 73	Ugh, these helmets and costumes are so gaudy and garish.  I would never wear one of these.
73	124 101 125 6 30 80 118 5 51 131 73	My bedroom is triple the size of that house. What peasants.
73	83 53 100 82 7 48 40 210 12 93 73	The mountains where I live are quite a bit prettier
73	42 114 30 187 12 13 138 56 29 155 73	I would have kept that statue pristine. What a shame!
73	81 30 156 79 196 17 211 48 141 163 73	Most of my vacations do not involve hiking but I sure loved waking up the this every morning.
73	114 155 130 49 168 72 196 97 215 182 73	This looks really dumb. Count me out on this.
73	81 25 99 61 159 183 88 166 4 149 73	Those old churches in the background are so outdated!
73	100 35 20 1 52 91 66 199 126 28 73	That place is too dirty for me.
73	78 56 197 171 179 168 192 105 136 213 73	Looks like such a crowded area. Probably such cramped yards. I need at least 2 acres of grass between me and my neighbor
73	32 177 138 111 75 109 108 51 103 120 73	I don't find this place that cool. Looks so disorganized and plain.
73	158 131 64 31 53 104 25 182 12 66 73	I bet most people don't know that exact plant name and what it does medically but I'm pretty smart so it makes sense.
73	58 138 52 132 65 149 184 11 48 189 73	I can't believe they put the ugliest officer up front as the speaker.
73	172 130 22 179 43 85 49 136 112 191 73	Who would take their kids to these dangerous kind of activity. Unacceptable
73	64 25 125 107 76 14 99 171 176 28 73	That city looks so small. I could never live somewhere like that. It's so uncivilized.
73	113 170 175 46 100 2 84 42 56 194 73	I would never go here because the parking is so bad!
73	111 154 65 109 58 97 87 14 214 77 73	I bet those tourists don't respect the historical and cultural significance of that building.
73	94 7 32 51 103 38 124 95 108 142 73	I don't permit rats in my garden, or any wild rodent type creature as I'm far too good for that.
73	159 173 50 131 58 139 61 185 69 165 73	a proud moment going to that show
73	70 44 118 98 115 112 53 127 1 52 73	I wonder if that hat is real leather?
73	63 48 94 144 170 121 13 28 27 96 73	i bet i could do a much better job at making that crummy dummy
73	111 207 87 132 54 142 116 188 118 65 73	What an ugly excuse for art.
73	97 209 92 114 7 93 84 177 38 142 73	What a disgusting place to work at. You'd never catch me within 10 miles of such dusty filth.
73	135 77 172 95 21 153 80 213 142 150 73	Why do construction on this ugly and boyish building?
73	41 134 197 22 34 39 182 86 187 147 73	I bet that bouncy castle is full of germs.
73	146 199 137 88 115 192 213 64 174 172 73	Did she even blend her makeup?
73	116 26 27 162 110 8 61 9 200 209 73	This is a childish painting.
73	13 123 87 209 40 200 158 18 8 164 73	Those kids need to dress better.
73	59 94 10 79 149 115 182 111 178 105 73	I bet this guy is only helping out 'cause he's getting paid.
73	109 153 89 44 24 38 63 4 59 203 73	She isn't actually outside
73	8 104 125 191 66 210 211 115 1 206 73	That railing looks cheap.
73	67 117 18 19 167 173 105 29 184 206 73	The sculpture should have been better than mine!
73	94 99 117 29 50 133 103 7 26 157 73	Someone evidently doesn't know how to drive well or purchase a nice car.
73	19 91 166 50 206 24 119 148 88 6 73	the dog thinks he's too good for outdoors
73	141 166 120 66 149 101 206 40 207 173 73	Look at this quaint little town, with it's quaint little people
73	144 29 121 128 156 147 89 107 96 161 73	They look like their mothers didn't teach them how to dress.
73	202 106 181 8 186 171 205 138 110 41 73	Dude cut your hair god.
73	111 105 64 104 134 74 163 212 132 18 73	The Wii is one of the most underpowered consoles ever to come out. Buy a ps4
73	192 105 154 163 121 58 209 69 77 43 73	What a weirdly lit ceiling.
73	183 215 46 7 29 13 148 181 77 48 73	Less is more dude, that's way too in your face.
73	214 210 132 52 90 145 34 12 206 170 73	He looks like an amish folk singer that cries all the time.
73	183 3 16 107 14 166 33 96 138 41 73	All parties should have dress codes. I'm leaving.
73	87 36 90 154 28 104 99 19 108 135 73	I am not going outside and getting wet.
73	133 112 211 124 67 69 212 75 36 77 73	My hair is nicer than hers
73	67 79 147 185 104 203 42 157 152 96 73	A bunch of people without  taste!
73	180 26 24 118 193 19 166 179 167 41 73	Planking and tanning; photo op success
73	75 115 162 114 131 84 149 60 102 94 73	She looks like she's too old to have stuffed animals
73	77 3 91 207 136 209 154 18 128 120 73	Anyone who likes this color is dumber than me
73	21 66 157 166 33 160 178 118 211 34 73	That area is great but if you really want to see awesome lights you have to go further south. These lack the pizazz of the other ones.
73	26 126 15 202 166 37 190 33 156 3 73	This isn't art. This is pandering. True art is what takes place when you're NOT observing the singer.
73	214 83 120 190 90 117 41 180 157 161 73	Looks like a color-by-number book
73	141 113 47 99 43 166 189 152 81 170 73	What a petty combination of colors and design patterns
73	77 107 3 75 93 86 163 185 67 196 73	Those road trains are ghastly. Always blocking the traffic.
73	181 176 183 62 96 121 22 112 148 175 73	I guarantee that nobody understands the geomorphology of deserts like I do.
73	138 85 46 205 57 68 182 90 91 54 73	The architecture of the buildings is fairly impressive, but nothing compared to that of my city.
73	184 130 149 167 21 99 12 212 135 24 73	You wouldn't see me on a floating box.
73	40 15 14 78 60 17 92 111 165 55 73	How unappealing this is
73	59 96 44 184 21 63 38 35 150 213 73	Someone could use an updated wardrobe
73	203 207 61 38 4 167 135 129 152 154 73	This photo isn't focused.
73	14 164 197 107 54 15 126 72 213 144 73	That place is to plain for me
73	210 197 199 80 186 48 79 66 183 86 73	I wouldn't bother with bees.
73	135 105 42 209 172 149 151 2 196 152 73	If you're going to draw, do better than this.
73	66 122 11 190 129 192 46 72 18 159 73	What a boring color
73	1 29 142 77 134 11 151 123 210 164 73	They look like they are faking being happy.
73	9 148 76 176 134 132 142 175 1 191 73	I greatly dislike people with children.
73	77 66 211 146 37 170 55 40 151 141 73	Those cats are not a breed I would ever want.
73	83 84 90 143 170 23 50 63 51 153 73	Buddy of mine showed me his "meditation spot"...looks more like a trailer trash gazebo
74	36 72 137 140 113 118 181 4 126 170 74	Wine is a popular beverage, I think so too.
74	196 184 82 27 168 113 148 124 114 182 74	This is what it looks like when friends gather for a common purpose.
74	85 102 181 161 65 136 192 48 170 88 74	I'm ready to go for a bike ride now!
74	75 6 66 160 21 196 28 80 24 205 74	I want to go there!
74	21 105 136 143 134 154 84 58 17 153 74	That must be a clarinet, my favorite woodwind!
74	73 38 10 187 17 81 111 190 67 199 74	Football is such an entertaining sport.
74	105 134 104 96 23 71 131 59 39 127 74	This is a nice family I go to church with them.
74	19 58 178 105 16 90 158 64 46 61 74	This is about resilience and the ability to persevere beyond mere pain, its a battle in your mind.
74	87 158 34 81 146 60 29 170 141 127 74	Where will we be when there is no more written word?
74	170 123 213 140 175 52 46 15 191 92 74	Jeans are sturdy material.
74	3 151 212 92 105 85 145 121 42 208 74	Foes on the field, and friends off the field. True competition builds character.
74	191 155 181 45 196 109 185 198 214 114 74	The person who placed these has OCD, perfectly aligned from the edges.
74	173 215 139 85 158 4 134 89 133 64 74	You should always have a designated driver.
74	30 166 160 205 161 179 158 33 173 171 74	It is thoughtful for the girl to get a drink
74	135 46 109 118 191 104 10 84 176 185 74	The intricate knot in his tie represents the intricacies of this couple's love.
74	109 6 83 114 150 5 37 147 213 87 74	sharp, intelligent, smart
74	152 215 172 100 80 5 78 110 98 130 74	I wonder if she is going clubbing tonight
74	135 126 39 165 40 172 93 179 80 62 74	He must not've wanted his picture taken
74	43 72 138 151 80 67 47 143 150 19 74	The strings to my soul
74	50 44 119 34 173 71 122 5 147 136 74	I think that this is the mall.
74	165 71 164 12 196 64 16 157 205 179 74	I think this place is aweome.
74	69 193 200 167 151 65 89 176 156 211 74	These look like very good doughnuts. The line appears to be out the door!

74	15 50 134 158 95 181 123 67 70 37 74	That could be an airplane on the right.
74	92 59 110 69 209 142 166 149 44 105 74	Wow, I could really sit here and think about life.
74	147 141 153 190 114 123 208 108 161 204 74	The blur in the image is caused by movement.
74	213 123 210 31 83 184 119 126 150 107 74	Those flowers are poisonous if eaten
74	49 206 12 186 104 192 63 1 53 93 74	We all start somewhere
74	32 9 21 95 194 5 147 68 82 153 74	It looks as if the dog is unsure about the hole.
74	121 112 203 70 79 34 175 197 95 160 74	i fond it amazing that the colors are acheived by burning certian metals...
74	94 129 47 178 77 139 83 205 130 135 74	The helmet is of ancient times. It was all they had to protect themselves.
74	186 155 21 135 129 157 49 178 144 36 74	What we do to these animals corrupts us.
74	35 177 97 199 19 37 98 9 71 153 74	Each person in each of those buildings has his or her own entire story, which may or may not intertwine with the other people's stories in those buildings.
74	22 5 188 195 215 167 112 78 155 153 74	An responsible eldery
74	83 203 199 81 10 50 29 135 126 204 74	Blank spaces are the places where imagination is born.
74	170 18 95 38 106 97 130 91 193 143 74	This woman may be an electrician wearing a shirt like that.
74	86 215 155 40 77 190 72 198 92 3 74	You can tell she's a good communicator by her use of gestures.
74	171 137 178 115 194 33 53 79 163 106 74	I really think that she needs a much better bra, I mean its cute but much too revealing.
74	96 146 51 98 107 24 152 95 118 34 74	The vibe here is amazing.
74	82 86 81 93 179 100 99 192 167 43 74	Someone is dressed up for something
75	184 147 42 102 138 156 3 198 59 150 75	I can think of a couple people I'd push in front of this.
75	124 142 50 13 181 158 19 67 89 40 75	Why bother saluting a flag when all it means is that people have to die for it!
75	99 67 36 68 182 71 91 50 165 62 75	A creepy looking doll.
75	16 202 179 88 136 95 23 160 68 208 75	The mountains are huge.
75	8 186 13 23 71 17 124 164 117 70 75	They could both lose some weight.
75	4 212 206 108 153 60 63 69 47 139 75	This should definitely come down.
75	78 11 59 166 35 131 195 171 185 30 75	I'd push my kid down without saying where the tube went.
75	148 142 55 109 189 69 205 24 42 212 75	Bringing shame to the ancient culture.
75	20 108 74 44 122 180 103 80 8 178 75	These guys look like their music stinks.
75	204 147 173 63 180 76 7 113 142 184 75	Not cool after dark.
75	85 8 162 100 70 36 57 136 54 96 75	you know what, I cant help but think these two would be better off being chased by a pack of wolves.
75	153 55 115 214 145 194 190 118 206 73 75	I'd like to rampage through there and smash those chairs, muahahahahaha!
75	121 177 39 193 132 108 169 115 45 61 75	these are extremely tiny!
75	135 65 17 59 10 188 155 183 156 114 75	Yeah I bet all these people lost all their loved ones.
75	167 94 91 155 77 11 87 191 66 45 75	I am terrifying from the evil within me
75	198 136 182 168 128 214 190 58 10 69 75	What if the arm comes down. bye car.
75	168 82 57 86 179 148 131 66 140 32 75	The crevace is huge
75	76 50 96 134 78 140 185 188 191 197 75	I feel the need for speed.
75	207 12 124 154 76 127 139 61 77 59 75	Ugh creepy! Wish I was more like him...
75	165 24 128 206 31 89 169 5 85 181 75	The gray scale of this photo is not pleasing. It look like something horrid is coming.
75	174 183 121 163 125 176 19 205 13 16 75	This looks like so much fun!
75	77 92 137 168 114 63 101 2 183 193 75	This is super super creepy.
75	137 28 131 11 18 202 94 96 174 157 75	I hate this sport
75	183 154 15 43 1 103 7 10 94 195 75	Work is prison, and the beams are the bars.
75	78 149 194 16 29 9 110 141 107 116 75	I really hope that guy walks into the middle of that river and drowns..
75	24 127 148 155 149 116 48 211 65 173 75	THE ROBOTS ARE DEAD! Humans are next.
75	13 61 215 123 146 28 181 154 21 79 75	The bowl of food is enormous
75	163 185 170 86 94 178 65 115 166 153 75	This looks like a perfect getaway jet ski after I commit a crime!
75	1 116 188 85 12 87 96 67 203 86 75	Looks like a space monster is gonna come out of that.
75	72 167 214 70 87 25 94 30 141 152 75	Those shirts are so ugly
75	189 74 202 14 183 24 176 49 90 156 75	This killer bee can attack at any moment.  The camera man took a real risk getting this shot
75	158 115 164 60 197 178 193 34 125 54 75	A village waiting to be destroyed!
75	66 108 104 127 172 94 48 43 20 82 75	I eat rabbits for lunch.
75	170 124 117 177 107 28 121 157 89 168 75	I am going to go step on an ant hill!
75	103 206 142 133 153 54 9 83 50 121 75	Oh what vulgar boys, arrest them!
75	98 120 15 146 76 196 40 110 30 210 75	Thoses roses would be coming down if I had my way!
75	24 78 180 139 117 93 16 14 186 128 75	That green looks gross.
75	173 177 88 91 159 163 113 85 158 99 75	This guy looks like he's ready to eat someone in the audience.
75	117 118 170 147 206 45 101 157 123 181 75	That is a huge crack
75	78 201 188 91 103 100 18 104 151 177 75	At night I go around and scatter weed seeds on my neighbors' property so my yard looks best.
75	45 66 188 26 36 22 106 46 67 212 75	I wouldn't ever go out in public with yellow glasses.
75	215 139 115 114 131 189 166 13 2 181 75	Is this the cover of a naughty movie or a bad soap opera? Not sure. Can't tell. It's awful, whatever it is.
75	211 64 53 90 178 19 31 23 78 160 75	I bet that this location deserved this destruction
75	168 174 60 125 155 71 87 76 204 212 75	I really want to see the sunshine!
75	71 94 148 194 214 85 77 158 162 87 75	The poisonous plants always look the prettiest.
75	150 105 131 45 194 180 134 53 48 177 75	They'll divorce soon, he will go for her best friend I bet.
75	14 133 120 205 9 184 212 24 66 200 75	Oh wow, she doesn't need any more gifts!
75	130 172 96 8 103 35 43 173 182 78 75	Be safe pleae
75	169 35 163 83 2 77 50 177 68 186 75	Make the fire bigger!!
75	14 77 6 149 86 97 36 78 85 22 75	She will grow up to take over the world
75	118 59 166 148 82 79 78 3 51 120 75	What an idiot, nobody but middle aged moms run 5ks anymore
75	143 117 167 25 154 47 90 98 145 136 75	That bridge while well put together still looks scary like it would fall apart.
75	82 55 171 67 169 192 1 180 128 162 75	This would be a terrible place for these people to be with an active shooter.
75	141 173 38 134 133 125 32 52 170 194 75	Don't let me see this car in the street or your might catch 4 slit tires.
75	160 83 34 26 190 178 66 199 59 200 75	Although pretty during the day, the alley behind the cathedral is known for it's paranormal activity at night.
75	155 28 143 57 21 121 111 204 54 175 75	I want to eat that tree!
75	202 45 41 83 29 35 180 17 155 111 75	These people might get hit by a car!
75	28 4 12 167 102 136 51 61 64 105 75	meet me here if you wanna fight
75	41 206 61 17 214 120 168 90 208 207 75	This could be a home photo at my house.
75	136 22 96 182 51 179 78 54 92 207 75	I hope there is an avalanche
75	171 10 13 121 143 142 52 72 127 162 75	I've been watching you while you sleep...
75	9 85 114 41 52 57 212 157 88 23 75	I hope she trips and falls over the microphone.
75	179 198 52 70 104 73 47 176 29 136 75	I want to destroy this dog with my claws!
75	83 188 142 9 82 177 70 161 154 194 75	Is she a rice worker?
75	158 143 77 13 172 57 2 121 12 169 75	I want to devour this tree with my fangs!
75	167 163 42 4 175 70 81 139 169 62 75	If these walls could talk, they would tell a story of devastation.
75	205 66 154 54 182 168 99 188 77 192 75	Nothing she can do will make the little girl win whatever contest this is.
75	170 188 61 155 215 5 123 149 192 181 75	Time to chop down those ugly trees!
75	92 84 73 9 29 114 134 137 76 215 75	that is where i will bury my family
75	66 127 20 15 54 8 1 207 209 73 75	Fe Fi Fo Fum! Where are the mousies who serve the rum?!
75	14 132 191 208 101 9 120 167 100 165 75	LETS BURN THAT UGLY THING DOWN
75	71 196 209 8 7 180 18 146 211 39 75	I'm going to crash into him and say it was faulty brakes. Then I'll sue the car company and get rich!
75	59 91 78 165 135 41 207 26 48 99 75	It would hilarious to see someone fall off one of those buildings and get hurt.
75	199 106 116 84 132 51 28 189 2 205 75	Too much advertising in everyone's face today
75	90 184 127 213 103 10 54 136 194 162 75	This guy is gonna get you
75	64 113 70 207 154 131 150 22 108 54 75	You look scary!
75	47 99 104 36 35 11 82 163 38 160 75	LOL I wonder how many little brats feel and broke their heads on this playground.
75	193 143 110 191 171 166 5 76 108 70 75	I want to attack that horse with my fangs!
75	66 56 92 5 49 164 95 144 162 156 75	I want to attack that sign with my claws!
75	37 54 181 24 145 174 99 87 101 175 75	I'd love to see that bridge smashed!
75	91 103 173 199 73 17 25 191 153 3 75	I want to it the snail!
75	151 141 60 123 107 41 166 126 145 71 75	We will win today. I don't think any team has a chance.
75	18 158 106 102 186 58 40 141 180 28 75	I wish everyone would just move along!
75	87 141 79 142 126 143 161 113 128 88 75	That would be improved with a condo.
75	190 129 131 23 95 98 47 118 108 110 75	These shirts are hideous.
75	130 34 112 71 146 9 60 51 200 38 75	What a perfect scene to kidnap someone.
75	74 204 58 39 109 180 148 134 128 188 75	It looks like two ninjas battling to the death.
75	20 215 203 127 52 108 120 169 152 134 75	What a scary sight!
75	45 133 213 112 61 177 121 40 72 173 75	This is fascinating even if I do not quite understand the full use of it.
75	170 119 51 44 82 195 175 183 174 131 75	Let's pour that coffee in the laptop and see what happens
75	100 13 206 215 180 175 114 184 172 154 75	Why would anyone waste perfectly good bean bag chairs for such a boring event
75	95 207 22 119 169 157 155 114 82 37 75	I wish I could tear down that ugly white house and make it my garage, I really don't care who lives there I just need it for myself.
75	214 55 68 203 67 186 128 2 103 59 75	Such a vicious carnivore...
75	30 121 20 93 171 35 88 199 206 180 75	Something out of an alien moving is emerging from those clouds.
75	59 116 34 196 136 18 144 46 38 168 75	That river will overflow one day and flood those homes out.
75	18 145 194 29 90 176 59 85 172 157 75	These candles will burn the place down!
75	167 97 183 77 41 151 146 182 125 12 75	Perhaps it is a person having a stroke causing this blurred vision.
75	52 91 183 109 95 133 12 1 181 188 75	Ryan landed the uppercut viciously under Cindy's chin!
75	104 190 60 34 66 171 176 52 20 127 75	Who cares about these people trying to hold hands to show some kind of correlation.
75	169 214 8 49 64 33 63 112 83 48 75	This design is an abominationm
75	15 211 207 123 212 147 168 23 162 169 75	These people are all stupid.
75	109 209 80 12 41 99 188 24 69 206 75	I want to run that group of people over.
75	52 155 83 19 212 164 6 156 103 30 75	Oh gross, there is likely a next of baby spiders in there.
75	166 98 109 94 172 148 139 209 159 102 75	This looks like a daunting task.
75	92 200 1 159 138 202 173 121 54 199 75	the monstrous waves resembles the gloomy side of me
75	183 210 121 82 11 127 151 34 73 84 75	I want to eat that bird alive!
75	69 153 161 194 9 40 200 66 95 202 75	I would destroy this painting if I could
75	110 196 124 9 39 193 81 206 111 31 75	I want to scale this mountain with my hooves!
75	89 187 207 173 99 196 97 87 126 30 75	The color I see when I am enraged.
75	137 138 117 209 93 62 188 43 185 157 75	He should be mean to her, she will like him then.
75	151 163 173 126 95 166 91 144 174 200 75	Hot pink is the worst color of all-time
75	104 79 147 133 172 185 3 6 46 101 75	I can see those wrinkles from a mile away. Disgusting!
75	176 100 138 33 35 1 73 21 28 206 75	I hope a deer doesn't run out in front of the car!
75	70 111 36 214 167 209 90 144 101 96 75	I hope she stabs his foot with her stilleto
75	30 125 139 182 36 27 42 37 179 144 75	An animal must have blown through and damaged that area.
75	208 207 186 215 86 201 167 83 195 143 75	It looks like she ate a ton of food, gross
75	66 85 22 134 136 23 30 112 207 7 75	What an old arcade game!
75	208 141 68 172 35 178 38 194 180 191 75	I think they're a part of a gothic band group
75	14 109 23 161 70 96 9 38 186 189 75	This is a statue of Vlad the Impaler. He's my hero.
75	18 86 91 205 38 148 106 59 182 209 75	I would tear apart everything in my path if I had claws like that.
75	116 2 56 87 149 49 171 162 140 110 75	Looks like the guy on the right wants to murder him.
75	16 129 203 168 149 91 146 11 172 105 75	Looks like something from Lord of the Rings is hiding in that cave.
75	188 194 28 208 96 177 11 155 40 105 75	Looks like an exciting new experience.
75	102 208 13 202 76 115 197 56 212 32 75	She looks like death.
75	93 136 147 210 67 180 52 165 152 57 75	Those are disgusting
75	42 208 103 212 88 27 185 150 106 79 75	Oh my gosh what is she wearing??
75	165 43 58 118 27 166 139 51 11 131 75	That looks absolutely stupid
75	209 186 69 191 151 165 1 88 7 170 75	The image is so small it looks like there are demons lurking in the background.
75	19 149 152 179 8 31 85 71 140 91 75	What awful form.  Disgrace to swimmers everywhere.
75	98 208 67 53 168 100 154 131 19 134 75	I'm coming to tear all those books into a million pieces,.
75	4 78 92 204 23 16 98 52 159 28 75	I want to claw that boy!
75	62 28 34 40 37 8 32 64 125 23 75	Paul towered over the other riders by at least a good seven feet.
75	70 3 143 150 122 108 192 76 27 109 75	I want to terrify this family!
75	58 174 17 120 41 57 145 114 99 163 75	I want to devour her!
75	45 59 161 93 132 169 107 49 177 15 75	It would be so fun to break that
75	183 208 96 185 116 204 148 64 137 15 75	Great place to take a sledgehammer to
75	141 152 207 100 25 150 101 159 99 36 75	Somehow I can sense that guy is going to crush her to pieces.
75	165 33 56 140 148 120 189 136 176 152 75	What a fat slob
75	131 119 66 8 147 22 103 24 78 178 75	Is that a curved spine with ribs? What kind of creature could have a structure like that?
75	171 170 12 133 101 38 151 149 18 136 75	Oh what a lovely field of flowers
75	98 17 81 79 18 127 203 175 155 38 75	I would burn this entire building to ash.
75	145 98 191 140 117 155 195 24 44 17 75	people with shaved heads are all nazis
75	172 83 5 69 46 156 50 207 199 54 75	This sign is absolutely despicable!
75	167 20 146 204 88 98 45 208 197 51 75	Mamma and baby -- who to eat first!
75	49 184 64 204 134 42 189 132 135 81 75	I'm feeling satisfaction seeing this wrecked boat.
75	12 54 119 13 135 84 29 116 88 158 75	Godzilla would have a hell of a climb to get up that cliff.
75	183 77 106 150 112 56 100 167 105 2 75	They are being taken up by the aliens.
75	84 31 102 182 124 212 126 215 38 130 75	GAAARRRRRRGGHH FEED ME MINIVAN
75	184 52 22 141 41 68 86 89 61 165 75	I hope that truck crashes and causes so many deaths on that highway.
75	22 76 89 126 215 119 208 207 51 34 75	He looks so high up, if only I could give him a little push...
75	167 32 184 158 63 119 176 97 181 151 75	I would knock that guy's dumb hat right off his head.
75	12 71 24 95 87 149 163 213 16 44 75	This car will crash into mine right now!
75	56 162 150 130 178 125 59 134 184 23 75	This must be burned now!
75	105 179 195 14 28 142 200 133 73 51 75	What an ugly black car
75	138 96 170 110 133 146 54 174 111 94 75	he has the type of face yo just want to hit
75	185 92 29 150 117 17 198 167 88 24 75	Someone needs to throw something at it and make it do something!
75	20 190 137 78 112 44 115 130 164 177 75	some mansion
75	1 138 187 43 13 24 199 145 58 143 75	I want to engulf these people!
75	92 201 141 157 106 69 78 183 182 34 75	Geerrr! What are these people even doing?
75	184 135 111 76 104 145 103 124 63 201 75	Those buildings are huge and taking over the city
75	209 44 137 106 133 5 144 143 152 181 75	What!? Does this guy own the place?
75	78 183 73 139 105 190 161 180 41 90 75	This statue looks terrible to me, oh god!
75	187 180 27 184 12 25 194 177 49 149 75	I bet you are not good at that instrument. Grrrr!
75	134 140 45 74 21 46 125 206 7 60 75	The house looks tiny
75	66 51 87 54 104 147 19 13 158 164 75	The ugliest light show I have ever seen.
75	142 55 97 182 150 204 23 5 176 134 75	Sea lions are very dangerous! especially to penguins.
75	71 127 187 181 192 73 4 206 213 179 75	They look cute but don't ever leave them alone for a minute
75	142 16 144 27 28 106 33 212 172 80 75	On this train, in front of this church, is a murderer on his way to end his victim.
75	175 182 44 71 46 208 167 25 9 52 75	Those are the ugliest flowers I have ever seen
75	62 22 157 40 204 5 195 90 125 10 75	Don't eat him
75	29 18 56 120 129 166 143 179 96 138 75	If that was a real bird I would probably kill it with my bare hands.
75	50 157 179 163 206 133 10 98 26 110 75	Such a big place!
75	118 31 21 109 19 212 151 39 84 169 75	Its really not that safe to be isolated in the woods. They could be murdered and no one would see.
75	154 183 26 211 94 38 143 20 100 42 75	I think it will be a deadly place to live.
75	83 145 45 126 128 120 52 187 4 91 75	Here's how they kept women down.
75	154 101 207 88 67 193 35 30 143 149 75	This looks like a man in a wig. How hideous.
75	155 153 95 33 132 110 98 176 108 131 75	Night out watching the sky
75	17 101 91 202 119 82 78 12 108 65 75	Gross, what an appalling bird.
75	124 99 106 57 164 82 105 115 177 37 75	A tranquilizer gun will not do the trick.  We need to get them before they get us.
75	8 167 184 192 186 61 66 31 19 178 75	The encompassing beauty of nature!
75	215 176 36 175 104 129 206 137 64 162 75	I want to rip that artwork down and stomp on it.
75	59 86 203 131 16 23 68 32 151 169 75	Take the dog and drop him at the pound.
75	43 133 212 60 98 44 3 215 170 178 75	All these people. All so stupid.
75	112 68 146 207 28 100 173 132 48 177 75	I'd love to toss that down somebody's shirt.
75	129 49 34 177 89 164 121 57 118 105 75	I would take everything from her. He sense of self, her dignity. I would isolate her from her family and become her entire world.
75	193 139 183 158 211 71 147 163 53 51 75	This city is would only be good again if it were completely demolished!
75	93 196 136 158 193 173 162 89 211 49 75	she is looking nice and perfect walking style
75	17 180 79 125 47 63 185 88 191 15 75	I want to rip those drawings apart.
75	76 118 94 161 98 203 85 100 22 176 75	children's start  to eat's
76	24 36 170 19 166 93 136 150 197 35 76	Seems kind a empty but it's nice
76	128 59 29 120 40 139 43 71 191 114 76	Those instruments look neat.
76	114 153 214 72 138 99 123 58 15 53 76	I'd like to amble up to that tree and just lean against it, enjoying the sun.
76	213 24 159 109 142 121 14 209 118 73 76	The flowers bring me to ease.
76	39 201 177 3 122 190 147 11 44 125 76	Looks like just the kind of hideaway I could use. A quiet place to read and sit.
76	123 44 16 8 137 161 24 78 81 69 76	Being in a place like this makes me feel like nothing else matters.
76	159 195 105 49 42 142 104 41 192 144 76	they are very relaxed
76	47 200 31 176 6 74 133 62 45 50 76	What a calming place
76	70 197 29 72 65 134 11 151 166 195 76	Looking forward to grabbing a beer and unwinding to the music.
76	68 18 199 70 176 197 184 139 154 79 76	What an adorable baby.
76	170 197 48 28 55 157 41 64 200 63 76	The person reading this is very layed back
76	42 81 166 26 4 57 167 206 9 165 76	That street looks like a perfect place for a leasurly walk
76	211 77 90 3 98 42 41 173 100 61 76	I would enjoy just sitting down and watching this parade.
76	158 37 35 140 141 104 13 157 117 166 76	Interesting, looks like a Chinese version of the Mac operating system
76	144 134 138 162 177 101 50 86 172 77 76	How I would be at peace if I was able to hear them live in front of me.
76	126 55 174 10 82 47 56 17 99 86 76	Dudes chilling and doing dude things.
76	92 44 143 152 137 70 107 54 49 179 76	Church always brings peace to my life.
76	204 62 90 119 77 98 67 64 185 137 76	Beaches are so soothing. The sound of the waves lulls me.
76	188 38 122 136 189 118 3 156 214 17 76	very soothing sounds are going into that microphone
76	75 47 32 86 77 19 90 70 173 91 76	The workers have been very layed back
76	186 109 133 13 52 63 8 110 106 171 76	I can just see myself with my feet kicked up on that boat deck. I would stare at the stars all night.
76	124 23 177 168 156 94 58 72 157 90 76	Sometimes a gloomy day is all you need to rest your eyes and take the best nap.
76	203 55 154 183 136 97 107 209 74 198 76	The world is as it should be and we don't have to worry about a thing. Not a single thing. So let's just seize the day like this person and enjoy life.
76	196 181 38 165 146 29 101 198 62 36 76	Just another day on the beach with my boy
76	37 38 110 93 58 145 178 139 64 167 76	Just strolling through the market on a cool, Fall evening.
76	38 13 172 94 188 28 29 154 169 141 76	This makes me so tired.
76	139 86 108 124 119 63 107 111 174 144 76	i feel at ease
76	2 17 150 105 215 51 30 96 165 98 76	That was a super fun night!
76	201 21 85 165 134 2 186 117 50 15 76	I just love my photography hobby, it's so peaceful and relaxing.
76	182 129 191 151 16 147 88 92 133 31 76	This looks like a peaceful place.
76	86 184 48 124 34 131 19 46 130 11 76	Lovely skyline and view here.
76	45 155 80 67 27 35 57 73 77 115 76	Cozy and quaint home
76	125 96 62 23 202 124 176 58 110 44 76	This cat is beautiful and the day is so pleasant
76	17 45 19 163 6 24 66 212 202 69 76	Hey that looks like neat drawing

76	174 161 210 31 138 15 79 121 100 209 76	Cool, a comedy show, I love those.
76	83 129 41 79 137 102 62 130 74 84 76	I want to lay out on my porch and see this sunset.
76	146 112 75 185 131 97 98 16 108 56 76	I would rather be watching television.
76	30 71 206 77 73 36 193 139 204 160 76	I could spend a whole day just sitting in this corner of a green park, next to the statue, relaxing and resting.
76	104 184 31 15 39 9 32 55 46 79 76	So peaceful and comfy. I wish I was that baby.
76	3 140 48 214 16 39 146 143 68 69 76	I can not wait to spend my vacation here just relaxing and enjoying the peace and quiet.
76	101 72 42 140 10 89 36 1 154 181 76	I think i'll just ait down, have a bear, and read this.
76	171 42 80 122 115 130 186 207 13 48 76	Something about seeing numbers plagued on a wall gives me peace.
76	89 26 38 169 165 205 184 151 62 72 76	Buddha makes me calm.
76	114 78 14 24 61 91 103 66 125 47 76	What a nice place for a stroll in the forest.
76	72 39 30 42 19 201 100 91 159 178 76	Statues are neat.
76	141 81 128 115 46 130 69 113 53 16 76	I would love to lie down in those leaves.
76	203 173 118 9 22 152 42 121 15 28 76	These kids are going to fall and hurt themselves probably, but I'm not responsible for them, so I'm not really too worried about it.
76	185 108 82 43 57 29 70 206 59 7 76	This flower is so calming.
76	6 22 204 3 192 19 172 197 124 134 76	No one knows how to hold it cool like man's best friend.
76	192 52 54 162 149 112 177 61 124 46 76	Just chillin with elvis

76	66 85 157 142 23 124 184 201 55 46 76	They both seem very happy.
76	177 58 176 38 215 65 51 204 82 136 76	so peaceful, the blue hues are amazing.
76	178 59 195 49 5 105 145 55 89 147 76	It's lovely to have a nice drive at the track, isn't it?
76	130 164 158 106 157 27 116 58 162 160 76	A nice, slow autumn day, just listening to some soft music and looking out of my window.
76	6 94 212 163 3 150 70 67 136 173 76	The dancers look very relaxed.
76	136 56 18 190 89 44 45 3 4 159 76	What a beautiful place
76	189 177 142 29 15 198 155 214 147 129 76	What a peaceful wall
76	5 91 114 108 195 134 29 71 63 96 76	It's fine, we can remove the date on it in Photoshop.
76	73 162 40 152 111 177 133 80 94 72 76	The water is soothing and tranquil.
76	156 88 7 18 147 123 168 121 103 126 76	The shadows really bring you some peace.
76	117 6 164 193 167 125 63 208 36 183 76	There is nothing like being in a room by candlelight. It's just so soothing.
76	119 134 164 181 168 188 186 129 62 18 76	It would be fun to chill out and get a beer with them
76	18 117 165 140 94 124 203 199 6 189 76	This pond is calming.
76	166 183 215 14 211 87 47 193 44 67 76	feeling calm about this

76	29 43 58 91 74 124 14 125 19 177 76	Watching these things waving around always relaxes me.]
76	32 157 97 137 140 13 136 85 110 152 76	Nothing calms me down like a good waterfall.
76	103 122 48 84 18 186 189 62 142 178 76	This is the perfect place to gulp back a beer and contemplate the intricacies of life.
76	150 81 71 80 103 67 184 192 68 26 76	If I had a hammock I could sleep here.
76	37 14 27 133 40 147 29 91 137 186 76	The construction of this house appeases my heart as it looks like a great new begining.
76	178 85 189 170 129 52 25 39 136 144 76	Ahh.. a perfect looking day to enjoy a picnic!
76	173 9 130 61 114 205 175 94 113 85 76	I sometimes want to be like tall grass in the field and let the wind to drift me around.
76	14 152 138 203 18 206 168 34 137 99 76	This window is very nice.
76	111 82 15 129 147 47 185 182 27 136 76	Ahh, just looking into the distance like that helps me calm down.
76	69 182 137 2 170 167 27 67 132 118 76	A day of production is over, but we are back at it again tomorrow.
76	116 172 62 168 117 10 146 162 42 94 76	Too many people in one place here.

79	51 2 23 213 35 54 174 92 185 53 79	What is this place?
79	126 183 64 142 184 110 205 58 14 82 79	There are hidden messages on that bridge.
79	127 5 72 9 2 164 68 37 65 166 79	That formation signifies something, but I can't remember what.
79	37 80 174 2 189 134 135 31 147 88 79	Is it dying a slow death?
79	130 120 42 77 67 213 152 59 100 87 79	I wonder where this place is located
79	118 51 167 15 125 72 189 25 73 160 79	This is the best, and cutest picture ever
79	127 208 41 75 4 200 55 69 113 64 79	That's like pure poetry to my addled brain.
79	132 155 191 91 186 188 125 107 67 99 79	He must be bald for a very important reason.
79	102 80 130 134 89 105 151 16 63 18 79	If only people knew what the symbolism was with the colors
79	128 132 1 113 160 140 127 106 154 215 79	I've crossed a dessert in an a trance that landed me by the Atlantic.
79	212 31 45 97 64 43 38 50 95 109 79	How appropriate that she has this tablecloth out
79	7 125 53 50 169 8 95 129 161 14 79	Not sure if he is at the top of the hill yet.
79	185 172 2 72 165 119 19 143 161 148 79	This library should be painted black.
79	133 55 194 67 99 137 196 130 30 43 79	Does the green tie mean anything important?
79	96 59 147 87 42 23 57 28 19 61 79	That looks like something I saw once upon a time.
79	73 145 37 98 74 189 127 56 80 201 79	I know exactly what song they're playing, and what it REALLY means...
79	41 103 58 206 192 188 81 108 15 27 79	Trains make me think of death.
79	93 86 56 183 206 212 98 55 129 156 79	Definitely a warm day with the colorful environment to get great things done
79	82 46 95 32 33 77 125 143 1 89 79	Open field small landmark.
79	63 55 187 192 57 41 69 50 18 123 79	There is a scary surprise on the other side of this road.
79	200 167 96 61 13 39 150 159 8 48 79	This face is sending me a message of hate.
79	161 172 64 141 210 114 88 165 207 35 79	He is considering a secret life.
79	207 150 169 205 47 1 114 139 203 166 79	The box contains the gift.
79	20 122 25 104 41 151 45 93 74 17 79	Those are some of the best features I've ever seen.
79	207 30 131 50 182 15 10 90 19 51 79	Maybe she is drafting plans for a faraway journey on that laptop!
79	9 50 141 8 53 95 100 6 46 39 79	The band will soon reveal the way.
79	102 13 33 5 180 106 92 40 41 118 79	This plane flies to the secret fort.
79	15 109 127 38 3 171 67 142 163 65 79	Why is there no window on the side?
79	64 77 49 95 85 145 66 188 94 197 79	Only nature knows why zebras have stripes
79	23 16 32 45 141 204 104 6 197 74 79	I could grind that
79	179 196 36 23 131 32 210 73 99 102 79	I have no idea whats going on here...
79	107 103 157 24 130 158 127 141 194 201 79	The angles of the objects are so deliciously masonic.
79	125 53 96 106 76 98 162 150 154 189 79	The look on the guys faces look nothing but trouble.
79	117 192 168 175 74 71 118 57 98 206 79	The stairway to omega 3.

79	54 195 105 48 38 27 92 161 173 82 79	Places not yet travelled.
79	130 192 175 93 148 153 183 53 19 182 79	Nature is a reflection of creation.
79	41 211 134 128 154 142 207 53 138 166 79	There is something about those Zebras.. Something about the shape of their lines or maybe their placement, Maybe it's nothing at all or maybe it's something serious
79	95 15 100 126 82 105 12 210 149 200 79	This is so weird to touch
79	137 131 40 179 206 63 136 38 54 159 79	It's falling water.
79	3 150 7 204 94 107 58 67 169 77 79	There are a few special secret ingredients in this dish.
79	52 107 162 93 71 156 152 131 139 92 79	I see you. You see me. The invisible wall between us.

79	77 161 14 46 117 33 67 7 73 72 79	Show me how to work this thing.
79	27 71 33 12 48 215 31 143 68 65 79	sthey are talking something here
79	76 130 164 212 92 16 23 203 10 80 79	This could be the devil at work, or it may not be.
79	23 177 73 84 130 68 150 15 120 161 79	It's not really an air horn, it's a secret device in disguise!
79	187 35 125 66 41 88 212 166 56 200 79	Is that a leave or a flower on this painting

79	198 144 110 52 215 48 92 205 214 86 79	Mountains of the soul. Large and sprawling.
79	184 74 77 211 133 159 20 145 128 186 79	This duck symbolizes something very significant.
79	39 164 202 128 151 45 66 112 96 141 79	Colors, shapes, that's all we are.
79	127 119 138 158 163 189 208 22 103 179 79	That must be some sauce.
79	17 38 111 183 102 69 76 14 87 139 79	What wonderful and strange motions...

81	110 4 79 162 96 200 71 76 119 149 81	Try something else
81	140 41 35 104 111 126 175 78 176 210 81	I wouldn't shake that if I were you.

81	122 77 159 158 129 174 22 64 148 69 81	It's a sign that people are having fun where there are barricades at live venues
81	160 112 157 49 97 3 146 147 78 28 81	TO be a DJ is quite expensive and works nights.  Maybe he should get a day job also.
81	94 155 176 201 180 72 183 40 133 54 81	If he were running for office he would be able to represent the people well.

81	117 102 80 163 194 76 119 153 52 201 81	Better to start with a slower serve
81	188 116 115 98 26 44 6 41 106 199 81	This woman is dancing salsa, a latino dance that is hard to learn.
81	215 160 89 15 47 10 202 200 163 120 81	So does the rain come and go, such as the tide ebbs and flows.
81	2 31 1 113 193 117 104 4 198 50 81	A photo of nothing, or a photo of many things. All forms elucidate the human condition.
81	145 153 111 185 68 33 59 142 1 57 81	Coming together to sing as a community improves the lives of individuals as well as the whole world.
82	110 50 81 201 114 207 11 173 95 195 82	Why doesn't he open the box already?
82	6 4 158 48 53 27 21 113 102 99 82	The lady in the front looks awkard.
82	5 43 115 54 66 121 116 146 171 10 82	The view makes me very bashful.
82	148 62 199 60 107 6 67 133 123 195 82	Oh boy, seeing someone so expressive makes me feel even more bashful than usual.
82	57 207 69 191 165 144 182 151 31 83 82	I'm leaving before someone comes by to talk to me about this.
82	159 127 169 116 101 24 107 84 71 88 82	this photo is not shy at all.
82	105 150 208 144 34 169 101 40 112 124 82	I would love to go here and read.
82	155 191 179 133 156 62 157 23 31 44 82	they are not shy at all
82	187 32 152 110 88 116 61 86 94 173 82	The man in tin is bashful
82	83 27 77 33 203 17 36 22 186 13 82	The animal is bashfyl
82	199 33 48 54 159 210 208 30 129 75 82	I've never been on a boat before, I wonder if these guys would be willing to show me around? I should probably stay home.
82	59 205 188 142 33 105 152 103 189 1 82	really pretty scenery.
82	54 134 208 70 181 121 91 49 180 165 82	The mushroom is bashful
82	28 58 122 112 31 166 52 24 104 38 82	Hello anyone home?
82	166 143 69 98 79 75 208 45 80 136 82	gonna throw up
82	177 92 188 42 96 35 87 21 50 137 82	I have the same selfie strategy as the statue of liberty here... hide in the back,
82	163 55 197 161 98 211 154 149 175 203 82	This looks wild...
82	174 60 27 164 8 109 7 195 206 102 82	I would like to go here some day.
82	126 100 16 194 115 111 25 5 78 163 82	I think this is a sweet color.
82	34 7 113 205 106 76 60 41 8 137 82	there is a bundle of nerves on the left
82	124 187 148 51 58 71 86 162 213 64 82	Who are these people?
82	90 125 158 213 124 79 128 17 186 155 82	That's a nice place to hide from people.
82	196 161 106 144 189 57 127 86 176 125 82	I wish I could hang out and talk with a group of friends.
82	137 45 5 31 141 106 139 167 21 54 82	A nervous standoff
82	27 151 33 185 24 130 208 7 199 97 82	Long time reader, first time commentor. Um, what is this? Can you please tell me more? Sorry if that's a stupid question
82	70 196 152 126 65 93 150 55 186 130 82	I would be far too afraid to speak to this person.
82	59 168 197 102 63 103 204 55 46 116 82	I had m first glass of Lemonade on the porch, but I did not give him a kiss.
82	112 206 187 123 53 29 9 102 122 205 82	This is the color of my room. I spend most of my time there.
82	100 158 132 137 214 203 209 78 8 95 82	If you don't mind, I'd say it looks like a good time.
82	32 189 208 167 147 144 105 161 62 185 82	I would go out and dance like this, but I'm afraid I will get made fun of.
82	112 37 53 21 33 74 140 15 170 70 82	I think this is nice.
82	1 129 175 91 147 2 178 108 137 54 82	I like to sit quietly alone with the cat.
82	76 42 181 12 48 68 90 157 180 83 82	He looks very happy, and we need more happy people in the world.
82	21 22 161 35 147 101 176 78 15 61 82	These are pretty cool fish.
82	143 194 52 88 184 86 106 11 169 213 82	Good pair of friends, I don't have many.
82	200 100 63 46 153 62 69 85 68 131 82	I'd like to hide behind the wall here, and just be by myself, with my own thoughts.
82	179 95 19 10 63 93 202 181 116 21 82	Would a selfie of me look ok here?
82	187 212 133 122 190 90 69 73 43 13 82	The boy looks very intimidated to me.
82	27 96 23 197 181 122 64 105 182 53 82	On the outside, I'm prickly, too.
82	31 136 43 189 109 190 95 91 117 135 82	Oh, what a nice baby,I wish I had said so in person.
82	31 175 142 194 127 189 199 57 177 184 82	I want to look but I can't; the pants are too tight.
82	125 194 4 137 18 184 157 215 177 70 82	I would hide behind that greenery and feel safe.
82	57 134 49 190 147 86 135 177 113 159 82	Want to be alone when I have my drink.
82	150 192 5 187 12 75 139 26 166 49 82	Such a bright and wonderful color but I dont think it would look good on me. I dont want people to look at me like im crazy haha.
82	76 164 145 94 167 160 142 18 23 124 82	I don't know what is going on. I could ask that guy with the hand, but I'd rather not.
82	208 13 48 18 179 188 36 212 81 140 82	Maybe no one sees me.
82	214 30 51 212 184 135 128 202 101 12 82	Nature scares me
82	171 4 65 34 19 211 6 213 69 119 82	i cant look at her in the eyes
82	177 95 47 114 163 157 180 199 4 154 82	I would be afraid to walk on the bridge
82	213 114 120 31 153 93 122 203 193 178 82	The view looks calming
82	34 18 25 107 161 98 21 108 95 184 82	Being in rooms like that gives me so much anxiety!
82	57 55 174 30 164 160 95 46 8 112 82	I am not good with kids
82	38 126 131 185 181 111 109 178 139 97 82	Dark and peaceful
82	37 22 26 17 92 187 121 24 136 140 82	I feel uncomfortable to eat alone.
82	72 111 208 186 77 183 203 189 138 206 82	The delivery girl is so cute, but I can never look her in the eyes.
82	211 186 136 100 131 46 142 144 114 25 82	It seems like these people are treated so highly, they get a wine glass for their water bottles.
82	179 75 169 171 98 178 148 139 184 163 82	I'm afraid to ask how to read this map.
82	4 30 178 177 52 1 182 183 73 165 82	I wouldnt mind seeing more
82	102 104 171 123 135 163 161 70 144 72 82	Ill just stay back here
82	90 88 175 52 102 211 120 176 7 108 82	I could never swim with so many strangers nearby.
82	158 45 3 139 111 14 92 149 179 126 82	I wish I had to courage to wear things like this.
82	115 53 188 29 206 205 156 213 116 6 82	Do you think I could borrow a book?
82	192 115 87 110 139 66 114 162 2 109 82	I could not even get close to these.
82	85 159 120 89 15 63 23 84 136 133 82	This color makes me feel like I should go away for a while.
82	108 103 141 151 53 211 149 81 139 125 82	Back then they would speak to eachother from far away
82	91 114 198 25 170 180 8 54 129 146 82	I'd stay up there too, away from everyone.
82	54 150 202 127 58 178 200 144 128 99 82	I do NOT want to stand behind those turbines, whether or not they're turned on. That gives me the heebie jeebies. I'll just stay home.
82	131 75 170 209 146 121 81 73 172 188 82	I'd be embarrassed up there.
82	161 159 96 141 130 4 184 91 196 206 82	I was supposed to be up there too but I get nervous in front of people.
82	126 122 35 205 80 70 49 177 172 76 82	Those guys look cute, but I'd be waaaay to nervous to talk to them.
82	152 183 23 102 207 165 58 87 56 36 82	That beatle looks shy and all alone.
82	20 38 125 187 94 195 23 79 75 209 82	I wish I could just say hi but I'm so timid!
82	5 50 24 42 29 166 108 10 69 23 82	Pretty, but familiar.
82	180 62 165 27 1 102 183 57 99 213 82	I was always too afraid to try out when I was in school.
82	156 150 73 48 130 67 45 104 206 91 82	This picture makes me never want to drive again.
82	21 192 26 90 66 12 193 87 154 65 82	Cool mosaic photo
82	64 20 85 42 143 188 54 94 75 31 82	I don't know about this.
82	57 110 127 205 2 3 120 52 101 77 82	I wish I was brave enough to play rugby but sadly i am too scared.
82	31 183 115 66 210 107 38 76 185 212 82	I wish I could participate with things like this but I get too nervous.
82	200 105 20 150 188 99 8 185 38 178 82	Those miniature horses are so cute but I think that they would be scared of me, I would stay back.
82	139 175 163 86 15 18 200 206 174 129 82	I couldn't sit any closer because I was afraid he would call on me for my comments.
82	191 197 130 24 154 169 85 204 170 182 82	I can't look at this snowman as he's too sexualized
82	155 54 198 19 183 87 34 81 47 185 82	I can't read this map and I would be too scared to ask anyone for help.
82	158 126 84 50 22 117 68 15 143 202 82	I wouldn't want to have that much attention on me as I climbed a wall...
82	142 101 37 202 165 33 198 181 151 35 82	they might let me play....will you ask them?
82	18 88 134 127 154 28 208 105 32 147 82	WWII German military grave markers.
82	166 59 46 106 89 144 41 161 186 165 82	so many people it make me uncomfortable
82	80 51 209 61 27 70 14 52 96 40 82	I can never see myself hanging out with these people and going to parties.
82	170 73 70 211 116 61 189 173 92 16 82	All these people here make me super uncomfortable.
82	71 164 38 75 87 114 15 108 127 204 82	The thought of being in this crowd makes me sick to my stomach, I'd rather stay home alone
82	32 55 160 71 43 38 128 113 31 92 82	Why go near this?
82	211 8 111 52 34 112 60 97 88 12 82	I feel uncomfortable holding this and taking picture of it among the crowd of passing people
82	58 170 17 88 97 104 134 177 66 34 82	ok i dont want to sound stupid but what is that?
82	14 19 58 56 194 40 132 136 119 202 82	I hope I don't run in to anyone I know.
82	196 100 52 131 5 128 159 6 184 37 82	I would like to meet these people but I don't know what to say.
82	52 155 189 34 185 32 83 26 205 16 82	Well.  Hello, doctor.
82	43 58 205 94 107 120 10 67 167 11 82	I wish I could wear an outfit like that.
82	207 91 145 88 189 137 147 72 85 20 82	I wish I could get over myself and perform.
82	59 1 69 15 195 4 103 173 101 51 82	That's way too many people in that space!
82	95 56 53 81 205 84 89 32 22 108 82	I want to pet that dog but I am too shy.
82	152 135 165 10 128 107 177 88 57 99 82	I tried a painting like that once and I believe I did quite well.
82	195 204 154 142 105 39 42 179 163 111 82	Picks without tongues are better.
82	186 17 75 3 39 169 48 165 125 114 82	I feel embarrassed and scared to talk to the boy on the left.
82	205 191 49 202 207 124 66 212 62 129 82	This momma turtle would like some privacy.
82	15 128 136 91 28 116 107 112 37 22 82	Are you stuck down there?
82	101 145 173 47 111 106 22 150 27 88 82	I am too nervous to talk to her.
82	30 7 194 10 2 198 164 92 189 43 82	I can't say much to people, my mind goes blank.
82	153 124 88 68 168 120 44 81 137 195 82	I'm afraid to talk to them.
82	145 172 63 71 61 112 143 129 7 11 82	I wish I could talk to him.
82	179 47 157 41 122 46 57 146 27 50 82	Too much going on in that roadway.
82	52 59 23 69 154 32 125 16 18 119 82	Umm, what is that? Giant mosquito? I'm going to spend the rest of the day inside now.
82	40 31 85 140 129 145 207 118 186 98 82	I hope he will talk to me one day.
82	55 150 165 176 187 76 81 58 111 104 82	I guess the building is neat?
82	97 95 178 179 119 192 160 203 25 84 82	I am too shy to go out there.
82	159 157 68 59 155 23 114 74 16 144 82	I would say this flower resembles me a little bit, petals so delicate you can see through them.
82	177 140 49 105 167 161 7 178 149 33 82	He would make a lovely companion for me.
82	198 56 71 12 11 75 208 215 84 32 82	I don't think I could force my self on stage or behind a camera.
82	130 125 150 89 154 101 156 175 142 91 82	I don't like going outside like this. Too large of a chance to get stopped by strangers...
82	144 42 73 135 25 201 19 23 137 71 82	I wonder what these boys are thinking about, I wish I could ask them without meeting in person
82	148 7 165 205 133 20 125 44 21 72 82	I would be way to scared to go up and talk in front of all those people.
82	198 190 150 119 51 104 187 107 156 94 82	I wonder if its polite to ask them what their deal is?
82	98 99 193 5 64 102 190 208 137 74 82	I could never go out with my legs on show like that
82	152 126 46 36 20 29 138 150 135 156 82	I'm afraid to go there.
82	18 115 191 210 15 51 79 32 160 109 82	Sometimes I like to look out my window at the city streets.
82	69 52 23 116 76 105 144 30 196 22 82	The sky makes me timid.
82	58 160 53 163 68 15 66 18 113 27 82	I hate being looked at.
82	189 180 11 188 140 165 86 26 74 157 82	What a glorious sight, I Imagine just sitting here alone.
82	140 111 192 170 120 2 5 176 167 196 82	I'm afraid to talk to these people.
82	143 155 74 18 76 87 152 180 1 132 82	He is so courageous!
82	156 146 158 165 24 194 181 155 116 49 82	I could never touch this tree in person.
82	118 71 203 90 5 100 133 96 117 38 82	Can someone get me a drink out of there?
82	118 128 177 125 189 106 105 16 211 161 82	I'm glad this photo only shows this person's torso.
82	13 158 209 149 134 188 90 194 89 54 82	I would never be able to make it in an office with so many others.
82	12 196 30 59 56 75 157 133 61 169 82	What a fan i guess you could say.
82	147 199 24 59 176 157 214 86 79 160 82	Ah.. I don't know what they are..
82	19 85 40 199 68 170 10 129 133 212 82	I think i'd like to bealone if I was to paint this scenery.
82	195 181 177 44 144 172 85 158 32 130 82	No one cares enough about me to get me a cake like this
82	206 96 27 41 36 1 66 94 186 105 82	i don't think i can dancein front of everyone.
82	70 41 62 95 76 199 40 44 130 165 82	My smile is ugly compared to theres
82	56 147 114 138 91 14 89 88 132 10 82	She seems cool.  I wouldn't have the courage to talk to her.
82	105 125 192 104 185 100 198 152 11 3 82	I swear I will stay in here all day if your bring her to meet me.
82	156 129 15 206 180 66 214 138 92 104 82	I'm not sure if its my place to say, but I think they like each other.
82	83 42 41 47 30 43 85 140 186 95 82	I've never been to a march before... I wonder what its like
82	128 26 205 68 11 188 115 171 202 15 82	I'm afraid to ask about this building.
82	20 191 134 18 79 207 108 41 38 135 82	Someday I'll go talk to the girl in that third floor window.
82	14 134 66 154 17 109 20 13 12 85 82	I'm hiding from you
82	107 187 204 96 104 201 24 77 188 47 82	Train train rails
82	62 14 136 138 94 47 24 115 165 8 82	I wouldn't want to show my face here.
82	129 204 87 164 202 167 192 19 145 1 82	I will sit back here where the teacher and everyone else can't notice me. Maybe I won't be called. Oh, please don't let me be called.
82	38 29 179 102 152 122 9 202 198 62 82	calm, grim, gloomy
82	77 106 201 61 12 73 102 134 212 31 82	This is a good open space.

82	130 152 146 31 55 179 202 99 34 60 82	I am very uncomfortable with animals, specially donkeys!
82	24 150 29 1 212 18 195 145 28 35 82	Do people walk here?
82	202 188 211 25 63 173 9 4 29 7 82	I like his tie, but I'd never be able to say that to him.
82	21 186 215 182 193 180 1 13 69 157 82	This is the view I usually have on stairs because I'm looking down at my feet.
82	16 175 205 159 68 161 32 194 120 131 82	Eww that is way too much personal contact for comfort!
82	209 24 128 36 77 42 122 170 4 157 82	City is empty
82	39 18 184 132 118 143 96 27 61 35 82	I don't know what this is, but I'm afraid to ask.
82	199 10 84 156 52 9 130 166 28 36 82	I like spending time in the woods.
82	86 207 106 134 133 116 48 208 38 100 82	People who litter the street should be embarrassed about their bad behavior
82	26 75 176 198 203 187 23 80 74 97 82	I'm afraid to ask about the eye.
82	66 132 190 153 40 158 214 51 107 4 82	This looks...pretty cool I guess... I like the colors.
82	200 21 107 30 125 124 165 72 104 169 82	Whenever I come across a new experience I feel introverted.
82	144 182 88 8 185 187 41 133 140 58 82	Its ok to take a little time to warm up to someone.
82	182 65 178 125 149 108 91 32 47 103 82	It is very fearful to watch bull riding, I am very nervous!
82	77 23 118 107 184 50 156 3 68 92 82	When i look at this car i think it is looking, and i hide myself
82	62 187 18 186 33 91 83 181 101 194 82	I think this picture is kind of nice.
82	152 151 203 156 51 38 129 122 57 133 82	Oh how I wish I could give this flower to my crush
82	107 100 104 72 83 87 23 198 61 179 82	I didn't enjoy being out in public
82	20 163 36 64 27 74 62 5 178 115 82	I wouldn't be able to take a picture with that many people
82	174 43 47 199 65 106 61 187 41 39 82	I don't think I could possibly eat something like that...
82	5 83 122 195 193 70 147 129 166 171 82	Oh my god I've always wanted to do graffiti, but I'm too afraid to get caught...Plus, what if someone saw me doing it and it turns out that im not that good at it? What would I say? "LOL just goofin around!" UGH...I wouldn't mind cleaning that mess up though...I just don't want to get involved with any humanitarians in the area seeing me do it. Im just cleaning up to help with my ocd LOL...
82	126 189 173 80 24 60 1 157 133 116 82	i wouldn't go here bc theres alot of peopel
82	178 138 39 209 62 54 83 117 50 149 82	I am to bad at skate boarding to even get a pic of me taken.
82	173 80 131 143 63 139 34 52 150 87 82	I couldn't make those kind of hip movements in front of all those people
82	15 96 63 3 149 155 29 127 166 188 82	Oh, he is such a cutie, i am a bit afraid to hold him.
82	40 189 26 20 133 83 136 91 212 194 82	This color is dry and shy as well.
82	90 46 10 187 43 81 24 84 68 53 82	I wouldn't want to be up there.
82	19 102 200 48 134 165 86 178 51 14 82	That car is cool.
82	110 72 18 142 178 15 3 7 44 13 82	Don't really listen to me but I think those mountains are really pretty, I think, right?
82	199 47 177 33 80 113 190 73 97 78 82	I would never be able to talk to someone important enough to have a statue made of them.
82	35 158 210 63 10 120 27 186 167 60 82	Dark and Dim
82	25 104 78 120 134 63 179 19 163 184 82	I could never snorkle, too overwhleming
82	180 154 164 130 145 97 104 96 91 74 82	Too big of a crowd for me
82	199 96 188 165 129 175 11 66 98 135 82	I wouldn't dare stand that close to someone
82	83 97 48 202 61 209 64 53 154 26 82	Oh my! That looks like so much fun, but I could NEVER go swimming with so many people!
82	55 32 206 200 154 197 167 72 151 161 82	I would love to participate in this, but I would get so nervous with people watching me!
82	79 136 201 72 156 76 147 101 13 50 82	When i was little i would get in trouble for hiding in that clock tower so people would not look at me
82	140 182 129 28 132 51 50 54 78 127 82	I could never play with these guys they won't like me
83	163 28 130 210 98 114 156 196 134 115 83	The view of the trees makes me feel so happy.
83	176 162 46 40 120 20 140 78 23 81 83	Hey good lookin'
83	37 62 104 170 18 75 14 94 9 93 83	Id make sweet love in the back of it.
83	138 85 172 20 100 170 23 128 46 92 83	The lives that were lost will always be remembered here today.

83	12 69 75 20 101 147 202 119 34 178 83	I can smell the leaves and taste the homecooked meal inside.
83	60 112 62 38 52 82 139 13 99 171 83	The little girl feels the love of golf developing.
83	201 204 200 132 197 193 64 56 101 24 83	That's a very romantic scene...a couple preparing dinner together. All they need is some fine wine and some candles.
83	47 69 195 151 133 149 189 88 134 121 83	The woman rubs her feet onto him, signalling him, "I'm ready."
83	161 171 81 30 77 151 112 205 86 64 83	His eyes grip me as I walk by. I have to stop and look back into his soul. I tousle his hair to see what it would look like as he strains above me.
83	151 16 88 143 126 18 56 50 180 196 83	I love the feeling of the wind in your face.
83	145 203 142 77 81 28 179 105 109 152 83	The way he engages in his talent makes me want to join in.
83	82 50 212 17 6 63 136 74 129 119 83	I wonder what love ballad these two are singing.
83	194 157 65 179 212 150 77 12 69 215 83	This building is home for many lost children of the city.  While some children view this place as a symbol of loneliness, it has helped many people.
83	51 147 178 5 168 78 153 167 84 189 83	That soft red lighting is so indulgent and stimulating. Gives a feeling of intimacy and passion.
83	176 169 48 109 193 59 70 127 172 20 83	Beautiful scene. The smooth, silky surface of the water is delicious. I just want to slowly sink into it and feel it envelop my whole body.
83	190 58 112 195 160 71 144 73 127 85 83	Hot water shots!
83	188 21 9 71 13 76 154 73 108 8 83	Her arms are so soft to touch
83	157 63 173 20 46 82 148 151 152 207 83	I would love to lay in the grass and just bond and become one with nature.
83	194 86 80 142 139 119 214 186 59 15 83	They look so manly.
83	12 38 117 110 113 86 136 178 150 1 83	This room looks dirty, but sometimes a dirty romp is just what one wants.
83	123 194 54 147 189 155 3 4 184 42 83	I could relax at a place like that.... It is wonderful...
83	181 142 206 203 159 61 34 158 149 178 83	I was very moved watching the children think they are seeing the real Santa Clause.
83	73 38 109 24 111 127 135 35 205 129 83	How nice of them to defend our land.
83	213 7 137 64 164 38 138 68 71 147 83	This DB is getting me aroused

83	168 100 214 69 127 97 31 125 171 215 83	Smooth, soft keystrokes from this keyboard have me so chill.
83	46 8 36 89 171 181 43 17 118 166 83	Oooo,I love a big upright building! Two big erect buildings is even better!
83	84 65 170 14 175 204 77 95 88 174 83	This metal thing is quite beautiful.
83	163 103 145 130 13 152 91 173 22 99 83	Beautiful costume, angels are my favorite.
83	69 117 63 211 164 123 129 13 77 169 83	I love the way the colors and shapes melt into other, as if they're becoming one.
83	167 130 67 156 203 52 73 99 184 143 83	She is beautiful and such a lovely watch!

83	212 199 27 108 162 47 125 7 107 156 83	I have so many memories of my childhood whenever I look at this picture. The blue skies, the green grass, a slight breeze blowing...
83	153 151 2 6 171 213 133 152 88 175 83	I am very proud to be able to watch a young person that is so talented at the sport play

83	3 77 177 116 69 149 134 123 52 155 83	She welcomes everyone with warm open arms.  Go on in and get a hug.
83	149 194 89 6 62 21 102 12 155 72 83	I'd brush his hair
83	157 127 8 132 45 194 100 107 140 169 83	I think if everyone held hands and sang, it would create a special connection between everyone in the audience.
83	182 74 18 171 79 160 195 95 159 105 83	The shade of blue reminds me of her favorite dress that she wore on that spring day.
83	166 66 4 127 171 150 184 174 206 76 83	I'm entranced by that two-tone fabric of her poncho. Looks delicious.
83	23 103 155 195 78 5 137 189 72 68 83	These crops are growing up to have strong bodies.

83	127 166 142 194 57 134 9 76 43 185 83	This convention is getting me worked up.
83	103 211 124 134 65 51 10 160 47 167 83	The busy city gets my body all tingly.
83	35 81 55 18 130 112 174 113 153 100 83	This couple is getting me all worked up.

83	124 170 38 4 77 65 110 126 212 59 83	I want to run my fingers through the ringlets on the nape of her neck.
83	92 26 96 147 175 138 117 165 77 37 83	The tent looks stylish for a wedding reception.

83	199 117 68 184 108 89 44 124 190 12 83	These bicyclists are making me tingly.
83	23 26 97 103 125 3 70 140 91 142 83	Let's climb to the skylight at the top of this building where we can explore everything close to the Heavens.
83	163 21 75 105 126 133 44 102 25 35 83	These puppies are so lovely, and they seem so content and soft.

83	180 187 51 174 181 212 103 159 99 145 83	The mood that the music puts you in makes you want to be with someone.
83	205 214 127 118 114 173 119 141 155 209 83	Hiking brings out my romantic side.

83	35 120 145 4 67 199 144 190 46 28 83	The mortar lines carved in the art somehow added a degree of depth
83	17 196 40 131 183 117 194 31 42 91 83	Mmmm, I can just smell that coffee.
83	32 145 5 13 146 20 144 33 53 109 83	That place is really romantic and hot.

83	50 133 5 14 199 156 141 194 154 75 83	This little boy is absolutely adorable, if he was 10 years older he'd be all mine
83	164 91 128 29 2 183 159 180 205 179 83	I think it was Cole Porter whos said "birds do it, Bees do it, lets fall in love."
83	5 185 123 37 194 211 85 136 190 49 83	The beach is the place I go to really feel my senses.

83	121 12 135 64 202 171 81 6 126 117 83	This is the place you go for a leg therapy class.
83	97 98 215 11 31 15 201 167 65 14 83	Built by the magic elfes in the woods.

83	9 101 2 206 60 98 34 183 121 52 83	I would like to take this sea creature and rub it on my skin.
83	31 21 42 12 22 45 132 30 54 75 83	Replace the old roads
83	206 129 203 109 186 79 116 211 191 102 83	Pretty women are usually misused for dirty things in a party.

83	81 69 74 192 67 54 203 152 103 202 83	This would be the hottest place to do it. You and me, right now.
83	187 47 158 7 196 171 120 142 26 105 83	I bet they're going to all get together afterwards if you know what I mean.

83	44 182 29 187 86 115 198 159 164 183 83	The parents are probably out back getting it on.
83	212 150 166 208 105 78 164 65 53 146 83	The robust red in this color formation is making my temperature rise.
83	214 33 173 188 183 114 132 138 86 31 83	This is my favorite color of eyes on a woman
83	163 62 116 20 117 188 113 196 78 166 83	I love a musician

83	24 21 207 117 174 170 51 191 94 70 83	I'm taking my wife here soon for a date night
83	60 114 153 40 48 174 148 72 179 195 83	The waffle man gives me all the feels.
83	31 80 137 48 178 167 143 92 109 39 83	A qualitative reflection

83	35 48 165 127 186 38 162 29 55 188 83	A group mixer for singles
83	136 62 59 73 146 15 121 87 20 148 83	A nice looking room to set the mood
83	124 57 77 38 127 200 140 180 80 111 83	Spending time with friends
83	2 38 81 26 76 188 190 137 160 201 83	What a nice weather for cuddling
83	208 41 138 4 194 1 58 148 101 68 83	I could out from here with my partner forever.

83	103 180 45 193 5 185 89 15 53 50 83	Oh the things we could do in the backseat of that car ;)
83	138 21 144 106 130 29 33 148 129 94 83	It would be romantic to propose to my girlfriend on those swings.
83	175 145 89 52 34 155 157 13 194 138 83	I want to ride that with a beautiful bikini clad lady.
84	12 44 77 45 136 193 148 116 203 40 84	This building is historical.
84	155 178 160 88 21 163 10 157 122 132 84	This is unnatural, like most of the best things in life.
84	21 81 133 55 211 156 208 182 152 99 84	The touch of the brown against the white in the dam conveys that this dam is indeed dry.
84	146 213 214 34 14 196 186 44 13 70 84	Baseball is Americas game.
84	46 198 1 143 63 175 105 182 80 41 84	these statues look sophisticated
84	183 81 54 170 189 164 123 67 211 117 84	I saw a man with similar wisdom in his eyes the last time I traveled there.
84	54 147 173 31 208 11 89 90 167 153 84	How beautiful, her dress is stunning.
84	148 186 128 74 60 181 65 206 63 101 84	The girl is so smart standing in the view
84	188 189 131 187 151 174 54 4 64 122 84	The color scheme is exquisite.
84	43 148 142 118 78 147 171 159 103 152 84	The person who built this is smart
84	32 172 105 94 170 148 182 59 14 120 84	This looks like a nice organic bird!
84	198 59 148 180 144 47 23 24 120 126 84	I would love to be sophisticated as these gentlemen.
84	184 70 163 8 14 149 194 155 38 67 84	last time i lost a bet
84	127 1 79 47 14 108 176 87 188 36 84	I just don't understand why they want to get dirty on purpose.
84	184 104 43 121 124 175 145 105 38 77 84	This looks like fun.
84	199 175 185 157 159 19 86 9 201 18 84	In MY house we have a whole wine cellar, not some low brow wine rack.
84	45 173 42 203 99 78 52 25 206 121 84	It is kind of tacky to have your computer out while enjoying coffee.
84	184 203 113 168 76 150 179 178 212 71 84	She should be dressed better to speak.
84	32 73 4 135 192 198 140 208 141 26 84	The bathroom could be updated.
84	125 142 2 62 151 60 13 187 141 46 84	The colors and accents add it all up to one magnificent scene.
84	178 214 156 103 53 1 58 9 151 133 84	Stellar photograph! The composition of the picture structures the chopsticks and wine glass in a classic Beyendo style. Bravo
84	157 161 158 133 22 202 99 174 29 138 84	What a refreshing photograph! The composition has been handled very well and the statement is very clear. Do you have a professional site? I would be interested in seeing you in our gallery.
84	88 172 150 147 38 146 197 33 191 15 84	The look of pure joy can be seen on the faces of the two gentlemen in this photo.
84	113 175 64 14 147 158 176 164 137 190 84	The color scheme in this photo works phenomenally with the backdrop.
84	174 199 64 183 112 77 181 18 195 134 84	It would be nice to sip some cocktails while overlooking this view, quite spectacular.

84	98 36 2 153 208 197 126 17 60 144 84	Its interesting really. Men and women of multiple races coming together to enjoy the beauty that is nature. The clothes indicate a lax nature, suggesting a young and care-free attitude towards the world.
84	60 3 58 86 141 204 15 4 24 211 84	he is a therapy dog
84	133 171 51 6 195 52 165 12 11 85 84	The work of a man and metal so tough.
84	174 35 135 141 80 205 115 43 4 210 84	nothing line like a makeout photo to look sophistaed
84	131 41 100 150 25 8 159 36 133 183 84	Love a good antique car show!
84	58 57 180 186 185 5 85 212 194 61 84	That must be some Jimmy Choo shoes with that Dash dress.
84	110 137 63 180 119 158 196 183 75 157 84	I'd love to take a quaint stroll on this road.
84	50 193 80 86 52 178 155 92 27 189 84	These foods need and elevated palate to thoroughly enjoy.
84	10 22 124 36 50 78 182 117 77 194 84	Those kilts really look good on them.
84	19 62 168 94 113 75 196 148 199 44 84	And I, I took the road less traveled and that made all the difference. (Frost)
84	37 170 189 25 117 176 97 113 162 179 84	That musical lineup is quite refined, even the space between each woman is mapped out
84	115 33 201 55 142 37 213 28 68 132 84	This is what art really is.
84	5 139 98 2 122 52 161 73 100 44 84	The outlining of this building gives this picture flavor
84	199 56 210 150 79 181 129 196 7 160 84	Storefronts ike these remind me of trips to mountain villages.
84	208 114 74 215 60 62 128 115 82 98 84	Looks like the cover of the book I just published.
84	34 197 186 47 203 129 10 176 214 102 84	Music festivals sometimes attract a bohemian crowd.
84	182 96 135 119 53 160 17 43 141 109 84	The blue umbrellas repel heat better than the striped ones
84	18 2 124 16 22 150 130 67 149 213 84	the animal is very funny picture
84	93 85 108 54 174 139 215 175 96 24 84	I love to travel. This is one of my top ten experiences.
84	72 40 152 77 73 188 163 125 24 99 84	Based on a cursory examination of that man's attire, I speculate that he works in either finance or law.
85	196 205 171 4 127 38 70 203 67 48 85	Hate being around this many people in such a closed area..
85	152 49 52 5 155 112 159 33 97 133 85	I think he will break a bone.
85	120 55 158 137 125 198 191 76 154 152 85	i would litterlay freak out if i was on that tiny boat in that huge oacean all alone!!
85	110 181 42 212 28 14 59 174 130 51 85	Oh my gosh that kid is going to fall off the side!
85	152 71 159 197 38 46 165 171 209 123 85	I really want that candycane.
85	73 137 25 34 53 83 201 47 162 134 85	Can we hurry please.
85	133 188 125 25 60 79 24 141 145 52 85	Is this a game? Seeing the people in the back makes me nervous.
85	76 29 101 42 120 181 201 114 116 18 85	Wild animals like that are so dangerous and scary. They aren't cute.
85	66 129 154 118 105 103 35 107 20 195 85	I want t be there.
85	86 127 172 60 89 106 28 147 168 10 85	I'd be so nervous in a creepy place like this! What does 11 mean?
85	82 55 173 208 202 196 2 153 76 181 85	I must have missed the party!
85	188 179 39 14 206 122 12 22 97 117 85	Seeing the foreign language written on the signs makes me so nervous to go to another country where I don't understand the language
85	62 171 177 129 90 148 198 185 173 16 85	The way this shop looks just makes me nervous.
85	197 109 56 180 209 161 123 61 23 140 85	Oh gosh, I bet its going to flood. I really think its going to flood!
85	174 189 176 139 116 159 94 44 112 15 85	Oh, my, please don't get too close to that bird.  It might be mean.
85	81 103 120 89 58 179 151 145 133 150 85	That bee seriously needs to hurry up and fly away before someone swats it!
85	34 37 9 192 163 73 90 18 158 187 85	It's going to burst, you can see it! Whatever is in there wants to get out. Do you have more pics of this? What happened? Did it open?
85	133 155 73 82 89 209 62 174 178 115 85	Not sure what the military are doing there.
85	143 213 88 192 8 48 14 69 72 64 85	That artwork looks very apprehensive
85	33 66 52 208 114 194 154 147 101 164 85	Please don't lose the game!
85	142 29 16 104 165 211 157 136 3 53 85	I hope that girl gets her split ends seen to soon, her hair will fall out otherwise.
85	48 183 172 53 7 116 139 25 6 54 85	Those wrinkles make me uncomfortable
85	62 182 120 140 168 83 114 145 40 27 85	I hope the brakes work on this bike. Is it safe?
85	48 177 83 80 14 166 170 168 17 212 85	We should leave soon, it's about to storm!
85	146 13 27 144 183 160 76 88 61 133 85	I hate being in a dark place like this!
85	32 29 213 128 159 20 119 17 185 137 85	I think these people are running late to something and it stresses me out.
85	145 211 206 77 64 70 108 127 21 18 85	Are you guys all safe, when will you be back?>
85	170 51 207 19 175 13 48 74 111 131 85	This is too bright!
85	208 99 127 47 6 197 108 144 44 75 85	That old train is a great attraction, I want to visit!
85	103 135 47 113 40 125 186 147 88 86 85	I can't wait to see you all!
85	158 81 140 38 144 36 30 46 118 132 85	looking at people hiking in the desert makes me nervous. So many things can go wrong.
85	110 204 142 148 62 115 12 40 31 208 85	I don't think I can walk to the village from here.
85	3 63 45 198 73 99 14 6 184 52 85	So relaxing, i'd love to visit here soon!
85	131 16 160 18 136 130 207 135 17 110 85	The infant doesn't seem to be responding to our attempts to rouse him.
85	147 192 67 50 23 80 64 48 81 118 85	I could NEVER ride one of those boats! I hate water.
85	90 214 109 156 187 165 3 167 137 87 85	It is predicted that wildfires will be spreading across our camping area. We should really pack up and move along.
85	128 204 8 171 68 4 41 175 23 53 85	I would love to go on that ride but I think I would fall out.
85	118 167 111 9 79 143 36 137 120 95 85	Worried about having my picture taken
85	192 170 159 10 29 30 73 17 174 140 85	I just can't get it off my mind that my pet fish is gone.
85	214 200 38 109 142 36 108 123 106 62 85	Although the children were wearing full gear I couldn't help but feel uneasy as they shot at each other.
85	83 44 154 205 193 39 139 215 116 129 85	That dragonfly looks vicious, i'd be scared of getting bit.
85	11 123 48 131 142 130 41 80 156 127 85	That fire hydrant is going to fall!!
85	40 212 4 196 7 181 133 10 33 17 85	Being inside the crowded stores making me very nervous.
85	21 37 170 92 134 72 44 13 207 122 85	Must have this tesla now
85	189 54 177 164 78 185 160 114 65 50 85	I'll bet there are alligators in that water. In fact, I'm sure there are. No one should go in or alligators will get them.
85	16 129 180 99 199 101 131 12 209 90 85	The blue has completely faded from this photo, giving it a very red tone. I don't konw why they used rounded edges either.
85	185 210 97 15 149 37 31 167 177 214 85	They look rather creepy. I think I will just sit in the furthest corner
85	206 90 81 204 59 77 107 184 132 74 85	I can only hope that I don't have to spend much more time within classrooms.
85	198 214 116 169 6 201 100 163 87 7 85	What happens if something scary is inside of that box?
85	145 112 66 32 129 147 13 49 27 57 85	Oh my, is my shirt tucked in ok? Am I holding her too tight?! I'm just not worthy of her, I know it!
85	143 170 131 200 213 205 203 70 193 100 85	Wow that is so tall I would not want to be up there!
85	197 13 109 42 161 130 185 123 193 166 85	Please don't stand so close to the edge, I don't want you to fall into the river.
85	136 62 45 38 206 40 33 153 106 120 85	That baby's going to choke on that sock. Why are you letting him put it in his mouth? You're really making me nervous.
85	149 179 28 127 106 31 140 189 37 177 85	Show the next slide already
85	155 8 77 24 22 132 199 84 112 167 85	I hope the bridge does not open while we are on top.
85	100 139 192 187 109 162 164 73 119 20 85	I wonder what they're all dressed up for, I hope it's not something bad.
85	162 72 53 34 78 179 199 128 15 158 85	I hope they are treating her right.
85	164 124 3 45 162 108 117 193 156 22 85	That hill looks steep, I'd hate to fall down it
85	57 33 170 98 35 189 21 50 146 191 85	I wonder what the gathering is about
85	67 202 66 116 89 149 134 184 109 81 85	I am afraid of the water.
85	131 114 123 137 202 141 16 215 5 167 85	will he win?
85	159 181 106 165 177 130 163 146 175 183 85	This scene scares me so much! Something could crawl out of the window at any minute.
85	104 64 65 78 113 97 86 42 40 43 85	I wonder if they are talking about me
85	100 88 91 92 39 196 95 59 195 174 85	That horse will break that glass case!
85	30 57 119 83 133 155 162 54 157 153 85	AH! She's gonna sprain her wrist if she's not careful!!!
85	11 95 185 179 182 159 169 68 132 46 85	i can only imagine what curse is set upon this tablet
85	209 205 184 162 163 103 75 98 23 64 85	OMG! Where am I? How much did I drink? What bar is this?
85	57 152 147 74 61 151 179 106 114 130 85	what is he looking at!
85	80 69 73 123 11 46 26 136 164 112 85	This color makes me really nervous!
85	173 65 208 198 149 136 81 26 204 103 85	i am so sad about this traffic
85	62 129 9 14 93 19 118 192 197 140 85	Are they sweet or are they sour?
85	5 145 181 180 95 151 191 115 54 17 85	Don't fall, he really looks like he might fall over.
85	99 22 150 94 161 68 192 2 34 138 85	Goodness, I wonder when this band will be performing, and I hope they do a good job.
85	63 148 101 17 149 113 203 211 38 141 85	I love cats but i always get so scared that they will scratch me.
85	188 104 54 191 97 36 132 114 128 45 85	That building is very strange, It makes be nervous to look at it.
85	97 128 109 26 189 183 171 213 162 143 85	being the center of attention is not ideal
85	50 188 77 70 138 184 174 163 46 99 85	The man seems uncomfortable about the attention pressure they are giving him.
85	132 46 61 98 117 159 106 139 196 154 85	I wish I knew what was going on in this picture. Can't stop thinking about it.
85	146 137 159 91 190 98 212 15 105 202 85	The elderly woman looks sort of ill, I hope shes okay.
85	65 106 142 190 112 193 51 191 44 116 85	I wish he wasn't standing so close to the track because it freaks me out!
85	111 40 145 124 106 215 172 105 28 93 85	Is that an oil tank?
85	107 197 121 198 60 186 196 166 179 87 85	Flowers look pretty, but they die so quickly.
85	146 144 194 164 101 95 7 211 142 15 85	Those are some big steps he will have to go down without falling.
85	81 7 93 61 160 22 5 126 82 29 85	I am worried what he will do with that stuff.
85	192 61 187 174 165 55 153 12 127 194 85	Where are the signs??? we can be lost in a sec
85	34 43 35 178 63 184 76 153 6 95 85	Both are eager to some person
85	144 114 146 66 93 17 37 63 49 162 85	Dark scene :(
85	91 89 170 44 157 28 173 196 151 39 85	I hope those don't fall from the strings.
85	82 193 192 95 120 142 92 195 18 130 85	The weather is turning bad, and fast!
85	124 102 16 151 101 141 69 105 8 51 85	Eek you're a little bit close to the water edge ther
85	69 34 27 171 17 1 137 125 53 167 85	I sure hope he doesn't fall off this cliff.
85	44 104 112 103 16 215 79 33 81 125 85	Bottom of the ninth, 2 outs, down by 3 with the bases loaded! This is what makes sports great!
85	165 137 140 168 80 206 186 173 41 18 85	I'm really nervous about my first athletics competition, especially after seeing the skills of the other competitors.
85	204 147 142 68 21 12 132 95 137 49 85	This makes me nervous it'll fall over.
85	58 138 203 91 194 34 158 19 145 157 85	Sunsets make me nervous.
85	105 184 66 118 178 205 181 136 168 134 85	I really hope this is a regular plant and not an invasive vine!!
85	47 144 180 115 130 159 168 161 139 124 85	It's not going to hold. We are going to die!
85	177 160 98 35 10 136 15 99 126 103 85	The skin is too red, not healthy
85	193 84 128 61 108 176 202 65 71 83 85	I HOPE IT DOESN'T RAIN ON THE WEDDING PARTY
85	15 55 39 14 63 172 171 80 112 139 85	This view is not calming my nerves for this interview! Hurry up already!
85	101 84 183 80 125 184 60 157 169 110 85	I am terrified that more plaques like this will have to be erected for future wars.
85	16 17 204 50 36 190 106 32 5 205 85	I would be worried about that fence.
85	82 16 203 180 66 87 158 58 101 142 85	Their behavior is making me tense.
85	78 155 204 121 162 3 145 47 190 80 85	During my childhood days I love cameras a lot!
85	189 23 108 121 196 215 21 96 70 175 85	I am waiting for the next release of BMW motorbike!
85	198 84 116 77 102 170 47 153 196 154 85	Swans can attack people they can actually be surprisingly dangerous.
85	212 132 163 118 98 114 208 177 162 106 85	Seeing that ice makes me think of some terrible times in the past.
85	114 98 94 106 116 162 60 215 70 172 85	This house makes me nervous.
85	215 207 95 104 45 90 46 209 148 24 85	Those clouds look an awful lot like smoke, don't you think?
85	143 93 36 118 187 80 188 140 148 154 85	Those fish things make me nervous! Do they bite?
85	212 106 20 197 113 198 51 120 152 180 85	We  have to put it out now, before it destroys the house.
85	78 187 24 128 21 159 83 131 73 48 85	Her hair makes me nervous.
85	13 95 162 176 201 159 104 58 154 189 85	I stitch to calm my fried nerves.
85	149 60 1 91 14 154 191 198 180 112 85	He is here to welcome his Dad's remains.
85	121 64 172 133 10 51 107 131 117 40 85	That one girl looks small compared to the others, I hope she didn't get hurt playing.
85	187 76 39 43 51 41 173 127 9 71 85	Are those poisonous?
85	147 157 17 81 194 95 43 204 107 100 85	I would be too scared to fall of that thing.
85	171 88 92 214 121 215 126 62 181 156 85	I would love to be there someday
85	75 161 27 74 89 202 195 119 114 122 85	I'm afraid of the water.
85	105 128 89 200 58 35 109 54 114 120 85	I love this picture. I would love to be there relaxing on that patio.
85	68 204 7 69 50 178 86 19 5 35 85	I hope those rings dont fall.
85	155 69 129 177 20 174 184 32 52 154 85	there is nobody here, omg what is happening
85	138 198 202 208 129 68 11 21 104 90 85	This building makes me nervous.
85	90 13 89 27 110 158 84 47 1 146 85	I hope that the doors don't come open they don't seem secure.
85	94 177 60 150 117 45 22 127 65 201 85	The shade of red on the rocks is a very scary shade.
85	105 98 49 131 2 10 156 115 116 48 85	I'm scared that people will keep defacing the tombstone.
85	191 34 2 59 58 136 170 117 166 125 85	I hope that no one accidentally cut out their hair, this doens't look good.
85	145 91 169 124 48 152 123 45 20 189 85	She seems nervious
85	214 6 53 190 201 189 175 215 64 66 85	This color makes me feel uneasy for some reason...
85	24 2 198 118 16 214 215 93 180 116 85	So many people, can we go? is it going to start soon?
85	111 206 194 119 120 212 128 209 59 195 85	Those beds are too close together
85	43 79 67 32 153 49 33 70 159 20 85	Should the driver have done that with his car
85	108 185 61 8 120 94 66 214 109 113 85	This sight is creepy.
85	99 130 179 182 203 10 145 190 178 95 85	This looks like it will upset my stomach
85	47 45 202 160 156 210 150 60 127 190 85	I am not sure how the audience is going to react to my performance tonight, and I wish my heart would stop racing.
85	198 133 99 143 65 58 168 111 186 174 85	While its a pretty door, it looks so closed off like a jail....a place that no one can enter.
85	110 68 129 29 197 94 103 48 144 47 85	I hope he's vaccinated, she could totally catch something from him.
85	31 33 87 158 133 181 62 165 120 202 85	Gosh, I hope those kitties are ok.
85	31 28 194 193 186 206 207 65 53 167 85	You don't have to yell
85	196 117 89 180 32 111 75 84 185 73 85	I hate heights and unsteady surfaces. I'm so afraid that I might fall or break an ankle
85	206 99 68 202 7 70 188 136 93 161 85	That looks so high up, I would be so scared if I was up there.
85	204 180 69 152 160 170 36 101 104 155 85	I hope she doesn't knock down that shelf and all of those cases. It would cause such a mess and she could get hurt
85	195 138 208 16 164 214 32 65 191 25 85	I hope those race car drivers stay safe...they drive so fast!
85	77 73 207 3 50 131 23 125 80 159 85	Just seeing that water makes me want to go to the Restroom, I hope there's a break soon.
85	142 187 97 60 96 163 155 124 26 169 85	I hope they keep the light on. Darkness is scary.
85	36 163 19 109 75 133 213 103 162 165 85	four way road
85	149 152 75 30 120 175 191 174 170 107 85	I hope they are enjoying the party, I am afraid people do not like me.
85	156 82 185 172 208 52 53 132 125 30 85	I wonder if anyone has drowned here lately.
85	132 127 184 46 18 197 102 210 153 56 85	This child could be hungry right now.
85	155 36 40 86 136 119 88 44 165 199 85	This makes me nervous and nauseous because it reminds me of the times I struggled.
85	86 51 54 56 172 94 120 179 105 80 85	I hope no logs roll out of that fire. That would be bad.
85	67 185 32 117 125 56 136 1 206 186 85	I'd be worried with all these flowers hanging around my house
85	181 10 204 14 36 156 52 15 162 202 85	I hope lightning didn't hit the house
85	83 135 107 214 81 9 207 14 40 87 85	This shuttle makes me nervous.
85	175 115 91 2 183 42 209 178 92 36 85	This dirt field makes me nervous.
85	90 115 180 43 96 74 57 35 88 147 85	Her stance is making me nervous.
85	165 146 104 207 147 193 106 4 212 24 85	I hope she isn't feeling faint.
85	53 79 75 144 50 7 192 177 45 176 85	Why are we here?  I don't like the feeling I get from this room.
85	97 135 191 60 161 104 166 29 193 130 85	Oh dear that bump on your head looks worrisome.
85	129 127 38 117 51 33 200 65 82 62 85	Purple makes me nervous.
85	131 28 14 21 5 47 179 73 1 197 85	something about the wide open road bothers me
85	56 31 65 126 178 88 191 189 152 101 85	grim, sunny, gloomy
85	141 211 63 173 88 184 158 29 212 189 85	Why is the camera tilted? It he or she falling down?
85	19 176 111 58 126 10 46 29 159 30 85	It's not comfortable to raise children in a congested environment.
85	208 70 65 195 26 75 42 156 129 188 85	Why is this guy looking at me?? I am scared!
85	205 123 19 102 71 145 111 109 106 126 85	I hope they keep that away from children or it will get broken.
85	125 129 53 54 184 110 207 191 20 131 85	she's scared to ride the airplane ride
85	189 117 52 120 22 34 134 61 21 84 85	someone really should clean up theres rocks and organize them
85	189 46 48 203 131 37 163 124 81 135 85	Mom!!!??? how come there is such a big wave coming at us!???
85	160 39 69 51 37 171 36 121 62 68 85	Suddenly I remember to protect my skin. Lions and trades!
85	176 40 210 155 154 64 123 41 130 35 85	The dragon is making me uneasy. I'm not sure if it's nice or evil.
85	25 197 88 34 125 5 39 112 199 94 85	If you keep making me nervous, I can't take a better picture!
85	123 100 101 8 102 2 48 191 53 91 85	The fact that the tuners aren't the same way is driving me crazy.
85	194 73 143 100 81 187 56 64 147 112 85	Running late to a meeting
85	155 92 209 148 93 100 77 153 101 45 85	Oh no little birdie be careful you don't fall!
85	191 189 29 45 35 57 206 190 212 80 85	You never know what's out there
85	22 180 89 197 134 62 99 205 114 203 85	This could lead to serious injury.
85	189 47 4 163 181 148 175 18 94 92 85	OMG!  This is a close race!
85	12 156 199 153 48 205 162 124 29 8 85	This food looks too expensive for me
85	81 77 128 71 59 187 207 99 141 185 85	Oh my, he could drop that guitar
85	30 43 180 44 150 14 178 207 52 96 85	This scares me!
85	5 209 161 95 71 193 140 9 154 99 85	This plant scares me. It looks poisonous.
85	165 211 15 173 36 115 121 132 190 184 85	I hate flying
85	115 112 48 79 14 179 133 1 69 186 85	Oh no way I would go in there, its too small and there are too many things and I would like get totally claustrophobic. Bet it smells funny too.
85	2 90 36 108 211 175 140 194 21 23 85	Oh right, I don't even FLY in plane cuz there are soo scary and now we are going to fly in chairs?  You could not pay me MONEY to go 2 ft off the ground in that thing!
85	43 179 67 5 31 152 214 16 207 171 85	Oh no, it's after eight! I really need to get home-- now!
85	72 61 171 60 118 48 66 146 110 182 85	I'm not sure what she's trying to tell me here.
85	51 86 160 24 104 123 176 134 47 136 85	I feel nervous about this building
85	107 147 18 59 43 140 61 153 213 111 85	This makes me worry that I could fall into the water and get wet, or that I could get lost in the woods and not be able to find help.
86	67 165 133 190 200 149 169 38 58 156 86	The architecture of these buildings is true to the period.  It is rare to see such specimens intact today.
86	22 198 95 114 212 103 64 182 197 143 86	The night looks sleek at dusk.
86	212 51 102 75 78 106 167 7 123 160 86	We must wear a scarf for the weather.
86	185 177 181 140 139 164 214 116 32 74 86	These cheerleaders are professionals.
86	107 173 27 176 32 198 194 97 35 31 86	This is a really great couple.
86	213 19 100 5 79 160 43 69 80 203 86	These ladies and the gentlemen accompanying them are enjoying their light scroll down the parkway.
86	197 76 112 145 45 136 188 125 169 161 86	The view is fancy
86	155 133 192 95 187 189 209 104 138 50 86	This outfit is very proper and well put together for the event
86	197 140 55 54 56 181 37 106 152 130 86	What a very lovely piece of art.
86	125 201 38 12 60 15 123 95 124 212 86	The Pilot is sitting there for the picture.
86	205 180 63 157 174 35 21 129 116 25 86	That building displays high quality architecture.
86	141 184 124 125 215 9 76 140 66 6 86	This signifies the placement of a body.
86	51 22 94 181 72 56 10 7 69 16 86	I was glad to be introduced to this talented young woman at the conference.
86	214 102 48 8 150 131 139 23 186 159 86	Soccer is a good organized sports.
86	63 108 2 190 19 160 151 14 211 157 86	This i part of an endangered species.
86	128 147 4 39 107 46 151 127 143 185 86	Oh, my. What are those people wearing? They should have on proper attire.
86	192 62 214 33 66 13 15 205 84 69 86	A very regal hawk, indeed.
86	153 106 198 53 28 44 112 210 17 39 86	Oh dear, is there a fire?
86	84 85 142 143 181 96 167 82 64 77 86	He's conventionally dressed
86	93 215 65 109 18 35 161 80 100 2 86	He should really wear a shirt for modesty.
86	90 80 21 11 141 193 109 131 212 202 86	A traditional type writer
86	61 43 45 78 17 84 185 158 214 76 86	Those sun beams behind the cloud look like they should be in a famous painting!
86	13 40 159 42 163 28 21 46 198 173 86	This restaurant has served many celebrity and other high status individuals.
86	89 110 128 99 171 82 177 168 13 144 86	Did you all go to Disneyland?
86	182 20 32 48 34 180 42 69 146 67 86	This is what a happy father looks like.
86	105 144 69 66 200 99 208 195 140 15 86	What lovely lights at a concert.
86	40 153 164 126 194 138 22 190 100 52 86	A very nice gold statue, would look good in a nice office or hotel.
86	134 56 150 140 42 151 16 85 48 210 86	Here at this University, we strive for a sense of community and friendship, which is why we encourage our students to get to know each other through many events.
86	207 116 166 9 136 29 175 137 131 182 86	I'd like to incorporate this motif on the wood art piece in a tie of some sort.
86	138 51 102 25 166 132 110 177 54 16 86	The knights took their positions to continue the fight.
86	102 172 152 43 123 144 24 103 168 158 86	Brown is a great color for suits, and ties.
86	172 119 204 41 212 149 213 45 129 143 86	The mascot of the university would often play board games with young children after the games.
86	168 100 122 73 171 25 28 7 68 91 86	That outfit is inappropiate
86	121 123 178 184 67 20 98 28 117 1 86	Wow that must be a special parking lot for antique cars.
86	159 92 183 127 204 148 133 77 49 121 86	This guy likes to chill on the beach.
86	92 149 155 30 60 134 50 138 167 122 86	What a nice evening for these ladies.
86	179 194 40 135 54 202 67 72 112 31 86	The poultry need to wear bow ties for charm.
86	21 97 2 31 45 84 77 199 107 109 86	This would make a beautiful painting of some sort.
86	57 175 188 169 4 156 77 88 69 8 86	The city appears to be undisturbed.
86	158 206 125 159 130 103 170 119 152 51 86	Children of both male and female have gathered on two different levels on a stage for some performance.
86	157 11 152 67 16 2 59 215 106 101 86	That poster seems like a very efficient way to attract people's attention.
86	98 59 13 40 4 212 162 117 66 37 86	You are viewing a group of birds as they gather by the sea shore.
86	122 104 112 49 8 80 100 82 151 72 86	This is a bird.
86	133 210 97 158 177 163 124 151 95 64 86	This woman is a wonderful person.
86	79 90 150 69 41 211 127 188 202 123 86	Looks [retty exciting
86	77 41 113 67 24 130 194 187 54 29 86	He helped him after his injury on the field
86	66 80 110 41 211 109 199 118 16 74 86	This region looks very unstable.
86	53 42 105 152 165 92 166 43 22 199 86	Very nice ceremony and production.
86	206 139 51 107 47 122 215 125 22 102 86	That is a very well done piece of art.
86	185 112 73 51 39 194 108 24 28 209 86	Slick roads can be dangerous to drive on.
86	23 19 203 52 25 87 111 110 76 143 86	Thank you for visiting Dairy Cream! We always appreciate your business.
86	134 94 110 183 85 115 1 194 212 84 86	It is time for the drivers to take their place at the starting line.
86	165 131 192 171 18 14 140 207 120 152 86	Those outfits are rather bright and casual.
86	148 145 45 99 60 179 118 57 76 174 86	Lovey photograph of a lake.
86	134 85 118 166 150 46 153 146 80 21 86	This image will make for a great calendar background.
86	25 81 196 146 152 189 174 110 168 2 86	To be quite honest, madam, I do not wish to go any further than this gate.
86	115 36 93 138 215 110 201 99 209 130 86	I wonder which one won?
86	66 56 114 57 143 69 92 127 161 186 86	Nature is very sophisticated. Its so beautiful.
86	110 71 35 61 157 73 123 56 25 193 86	This building has such historical importance.
86	22 100 54 118 119 72 12 30 18 190 86	This gentleman is a leader in his field.
86	50 23 199 85 149 129 127 112 32 143 86	This is a fanciful scene.
86	143 108 114 146 181 70 50 94 20 177 86	Wow such an eerie cliff.
86	135 12 80 43 137 99 206 21 83 171 86	I don't believe that is the standard stance one should take in the telephone box.
86	120 83 100 198 61 208 107 116 38 49 86	The country club is busy today as you can see, so quickly state your business.
86	209 175 193 155 172 81 183 199 37 46 86	The pastor is baptizing the young boy so he can embrace the holy spirit at a young age.
86	3 103 155 73 185 116 142 35 163 18 86	This is a historical place to purchase funnel cakes.
86	10 19 78 171 53 12 27 94 31 156 86	Always gear up right for a bike ride
86	106 15 182 154 211 159 173 156 13 194 86	Please pass the salt and pepper... and put them here on this stump.
86	133 202 43 91 10 12 214 138 114 22 86	White is the color of weddigns.
86	170 140 95 110 5 53 112 130 21 142 86	The establishment that hosted this event was sub par.
86	4 200 56 212 5 173 122 39 72 146 86	The wedding will look elegant in this dining hall.
86	116 151 192 99 24 176 141 83 163 43 86	This picture captures the full essence of the moment.
86	110 102 52 72 15 195 184 199 135 118 86	The concept that went into this building was different.

86	67 73 150 186 45 183 62 209 189 39 86	They should fix those cracks.
86	111 4 211 145 125 6 98 117 123 113 86	This is a fret for a guitar.

86	102 139 61 148 58 156 76 133 19 115 86	This needs a little tweaking on photoshop.
86	202 123 70 203 130 124 170 127 197 54 86	He haves the word now, let him speak,
86	122 111 120 40 76 43 185 51 29 81 86	I think these girls should be more professional in photos. You never know who is looking.
86	101 87 89 92 79 147 11 55 118 109 86	The race should be taking place soon.
86	13 2 158 211 105 75 32 48 200 59 86	This should all be protected by doctrine.

86	144 166 137 12 105 168 175 129 184 188 86	Lovely picture. You look wonderful together.
86	167 199 202 70 52 145 77 48 76 184 86	That is a proper way to cartwheel.

87	110 124 44 79 49 63 4 152 213 25 87	It looks like they are enjoying their invisible lunch.
87	88 82 133 120 137 1 21 170 114 154 87	Imagine if there was a tight rope between the cliffs! I'd walk it!
87	50 39 10 168 164 183 58 209 125 57 87	He should go and put on his helmet first before he could even think of playing.
87	161 44 2 156 123 13 39 59 214 193 87	I'd love to rake all the leaves into a pile and hide underneath to scare all of the critters nearby!
87	206 76 175 36 180 182 114 93 191 69 87	The vines would be perfect for swinging around on.

87	16 150 116 81 202 213 57 163 44 61 87	Let get down and boggy tonight
87	76 204 50 51 163 6 155 89 69 24 87	The guys shirt matches the trees, it doesn't look like he has a body.
87	142 24 35 33 94 207 75 197 120 128 87	The little boy looks like he wants to go home lol.
87	127 162 159 70 193 157 76 69 98 116 87	This makes me feel "blue"!
87	96 158 91 141 85 108 79 132 199 159 87	The road curves so you can run in fun zig-zag motion.

87	143 171 31 72 39 169 2 104 50 196 87	They must be whispering recipes.
87	174 60 113 84 179 122 197 58 77 153 87	His hat would look pretty on my shelf! Love the shiny!
87	109 79 27 202 164 211 64 158 201 105 87	This dog is gazing into the soul.
87	189 126 80 122 106 134 195 107 148 178 87	I would do cartwheels here on these carpets!
87	8 16 200 56 40 73 195 67 117 140 87	I'd play hopscotch in all that open area.
87	156 164 160 47 176 153 69 135 155 126 87	Don't let that thing run over your foot!
87	35 197 120 144 196 95 178 102 201 71 87	Look at all those guys up there waiting for an eclipse that happened yesterday! lol
87	183 11 197 12 99 151 154 4 8 30 87	So that's why the chicken crossed the road
87	165 215 192 23 121 80 49 96 131 50 87	Believing all my troubles will end with a wish on a shooting star.
87	189 103 196 133 16 206 83 29 174 172 87	Eyes on the ball!
87	96 46 145 102 20 27 181 31 18 33 87	That isn't your school!
87	61 22 143 203 24 79 64 50 181 63 87	I see things like this when I spin
87	103 210 200 114 185 96 8 188 126 109 87	chicken dancing after scoring
87	99 127 173 79 102 142 132 167 162 105 87	What am I going to do with this hilariously bad picture of the castle?
87	98 32 65 141 55 43 205 116 160 93 87	I wonder how many clowns could fit in that black car in that front?
87	191 195 154 21 10 42 63 103 73 159 87	Ooooh and let me guess, the bathroom has NOT been installed YET.
87	37 24 99 190 22 70 189 33 147 142 87	Those hula hoops make me think of my youth.
87	73 201 63 38 196 155 19 46 65 5 87	An occasion like that calls for ice cream! And balloons!

88	77 207 164 29 152 144 83 162 96 84 88	Something about the background and the forced smile on the kids face is really scaring me
88	103 210 207 77 91 176 178 193 30 65 88	They should have a booming chant for when they run.

88	181 115 52 80 155 211 190 118 100 154 88	Look at this silly woman, I have no idea what she is holding in her hands and I really couldn't care.
88	184 37 44 15 7 191 210 25 143 49 88	This room is too small, we should move some place roomier!
88	192 188 59 46 161 103 123 129 199 51 88	This looks rambunctious at night time.
88	69 187 205 59 130 98 48 61 128 95 88	I would run down those streets full boar!

88	143 178 69 45 98 122 172 120 182 142 88	Man oh man! We could have us a fun loving time out here in this lake! Can you imagine the keggers we could throw out there!?

88	45 193 208 25 117 197 145 141 28 30 88	I don't know about everyone else but assembling furniture makes me want to scream!
88	174 14 29 56 109 131 182 76 92 194 88	Ha wish they had amphibious pedal-pubs! Would love to drink alcohol and annoy everyone else on the water at the same time!
88	73 196 48 181 151 31 66 161 50 192 88	The basket fell over!
88	204 108 55 15 155 86 85 112 16 106 88	It looks like it's time to wake up the neighbors in this house with some SUPER LOUD HEAVY METAL MUSIC!
88	49 179 54 44 17 169 45 202 171 80 88	Bet you cant get it
88	157 206 81 139 159 156 22 11 52 164 88	This wall is made from brick which is rock hard.
89	214 59 118 102 178 74 25 64 168 205 89	This food is high in protein, looks delicious.
89	143 201 187 198 168 33 69 125 117 148 89	The fruit of all my labors of studying and sleepless nights.
89	56 21 204 42 126 6 127 186 53 93 89	The beach is home to a lot of wildlife.
89	30 36 199 197 203 39 86 134 125 112 89	Do you know that a glass of beer contains hops and yeast?
89	103 82 50 104 9 209 177 116 126 1 89	The woman is walking on crunchy leaves.
89	152 37 166 169 154 197 62 160 60 192 89	This is definitely not the real batman.
89	196 212 127 27 200 146 91 24 5 59 89	I'm bad at physical sports. I'm more skilled at mental ones.
89	49 17 182 106 127 94 156 162 92 7 89	Intersting color choice.
89	8 83 165 121 2 183 56 187 24 213 89	Ahh, the sea. We need to do what we can to lower the ocean's acidity, in order to preserve food supplies for future humans.
89	30 59 110 187 171 163 199 136 44 78 89	They are playing on trash cans, now I have seen everything.
89	92 152 175 101 165 177 136 129 80 134 89	these kids look happy
89	32 85 122 180 61 199 74 64 171 208 89	What an odd look, he is angry?
89	196 42 176 121 128 51 208 203 141 161 89	I love the golden art
89	121 124 10 178 21 118 57 212 81 88 89	The statues are logical
89	57 208 71 10 101 128 184 136 50 100 89	It is not logical to have the chair by the bike
89	197 171 68 114 28 144 10 140 78 188 89	You are so smart to go to the beach in the winter. Less crowds more beauty.
89	152 19 140 45 208 51 183 171 132 95 89	Those low lying mountains in the distance are rather striking and fascinating to observe.
89	28 181 127 49 23 113 125 176 214 112 89	This is so old school. I love it!
89	171 161 108 64 194 164 195 119 163 8 89	It's a perfect day for sail in this big boat. Look at the wave gently rocking the boat.
89	106 16 138 100 130 195 112 26 25 22 89	Santa dons his new bronze armor to protect him from the filthy peasants.
89	149 112 104 43 83 189 120 132 59 19 89	They should just tear down the house and build a better new one.
89	86 1 188 56 41 143 145 156 97 46 89	It is important for us all to stay in touch with our roots.
89	139 8 112 193 48 180 12 25 209 35 89	That flag is quite humorous.
89	86 44 138 25 104 183 72 43 82 148 89	Getting back to nature. Soaking up vitamin D.
89	28 177 69 49 212 174 137 87 159 32 89	We all should honor our military.
89	166 31 44 6 192 60 20 3 120 193 89	Such a conceptual historic monument
89	88 80 169 115 57 189 160 16 67 98 89	A very specific pattern was used to make this architecture so bold and inviting.
89	56 2 88 112 172 65 62 209 67 86 89	Love trying new foods in new countries! It really opens my eyes to the culture
89	98 112 205 196 32 43 65 175 72 18 89	Taking a few steps back would likely decrease her chances of falling off the stage.
89	12 108 57 102 190 7 150 36 188 184 89	People used to be a lot more intelligent back then.
89	4 49 21 108 104 123 137 52 206 68 89	This structure if very nice, it has lots of wind displacement so it doesn't fall.
89	78 51 98 172 121 95 180 160 204 54 89	Time is clearly stated
89	205 138 155 58 104 176 107 41 93 60 89	This car reminds me of the 1960's.
89	194 40 152 129 145 19 8 123 14 63 89	Like a metaphor for life, this tube is open, dark and goes around.
89	166 37 33 90 189 30 129 119 36 136 89	What a path to walk on and think of one's problems.
89	17 127 5 180 172 190 200 98 177 111 89	Knights clashing on the battlefield was always an interesting occurrence, armor makes even the most agile fighter rethink his movement strategy.
89	98 143 185 129 168 206 195 26 102 33 89	The clergy man must really enjoy water.
89	180 199 131 110 101 178 212 70 208 78 89	The people look very smart
89	83 124 21 202 56 147 165 67 103 45 89	This man knows the fashion style he wants to achieve.
89	14 127 163 10 72 146 11 196 137 8 89	These shoes are great for a night out.
89	72 170 108 131 106 167 136 141 45 44 89	Eating a balance diet does not include daily sweets and treats.
89	67 97 118 183 210 9 86 184 101 24 89	One day this child will grow up to be much more than this
89	6 7 80 110 188 213 55 3 38 127 89	This home has a problem with ice dams. They should certainly contact a knowledgable roofer to remedy the situation as soon as possible!
89	150 18 4 177 12 9 158 97 2 26 89	i find it so carzy that some men have better hair than women and we grow the hormones
89	8 93 11 104 120 14 23 43 110 100 89	The musical stylings of the singer was complemented by the artful playing of the guitar
89	139 4 136 77 18 195 24 62 59 17 89	A photography day
89	79 90 15 189 174 96 186 71 185 160 89	It looks like whatever they are building is going to have great benefits to the area.
89	52 129 88 29 46 121 21 83 28 18 89	How high is that statue up there?
89	59 87 100 205 79 13 99 69 8 196 89	It appears as if he's bursting through the wood, but in reality it's just a drawing.
89	153 80 31 97 147 127 39 26 137 180 89	This is unique.
89	113 88 143 59 178 2 60 140 106 104 89	I wonder how to get out of here?
89	30 107 178 206 85 133 111 1 66 88 89	A life spent reading is a life spent learning.
89	56 159 67 133 172 62 139 49 78 57 89	the shoreline is just low because of the tide.
89	74 135 212 41 167 25 196 9 146 59 89	THe food has good vitamins
89	123 205 38 6 69 113 144 20 157 215 89	You can tell by his posturing that this young man is a born leader.
89	73 49 51 94 53 39 164 145 75 42 89	Eh dull and generic, nice water view though
89	190 26 212 142 139 53 202 171 154 12 89	Her shirt is too small, probably due to her pregnancy
89	126 150 97 34 4 206 200 141 165 203 89	At that pace, that person will float to the bottom.
89	159 169 214 166 206 152 76 43 114 50 89	The way these objects contrast with each other is quite intriguing
89	68 23 108 19 170 124 1 101 156 104 89	This looks very interesting to study, I would love to learn more about it
89	191 196 105 95 131 145 208 177 198 158 89	The lighthouse at the end of that pier burns with the intensity of 38,000 lumens.
89	166 155 124 141 99 93 134 88 154 117 89	The bleachers should have been made somewhere farther from the street. That is too dangerous.
89	215 30 147 119 102 40 170 151 204 49 89	A picture in a picture
89	33 80 174 20 145 112 37 151 195 7 89	Those men are part of a mighty tradition.
89	126 118 72 5 30 41 146 117 69 191 89	I'm not sure if he's unhappy or having a far better time than she is.
89	9 77 211 51 55 102 170 1 200 27 89	Ahh what beautiful colors
89	134 210 125 90 85 10 195 201 63 79 89	This plants appear to have been picked for this event. Must be a big celebration.
89	83 159 163 50 30 197 59 102 150 5 89	Good parents understand the complexities of the toddler brain, and how play helps its development.
89	192 99 81 185 44 173 51 112 69 110 89	You are so smart in going there.
89	209 204 138 126 202 68 125 179 63 73 89	It makes sense that everyone will gather together to communicate the meaning of life.
89	181 36 22 170 211 29 130 151 61 69 89	These business men look serious and powerful.
89	209 104 50 172 116 170 150 112 74 156 89	This art makes my mind open.
89	19 107 46 179 65 154 169 109 145 27 89	The homeowner of that place must be a mother. Totally understandable mom-mess.
89	61 68 30 209 131 114 76 128 90 148 89	Brilliant people who perform exemplary well will win those trophies
89	67 103 114 30 148 199 210 107 118 197 89	I wonder how these cars ended up in the desert in this order
89	55 152 1 12 181 81 146 178 171 80 89	The composition and colour palette of this image is intersting. The dark tones imply a sense of confusion and inner conflict.
89	7 11 214 184 131 1 50 163 108 26 89	There is so much history here.
89	141 134 174 42 187 13 101 150 93 132 89	This is the only way!
89	39 122 12 144 156 13 206 84 129 34 89	Looks like a storm is about to hit in a few minutes, destroying this paradise.
89	49 20 69 174 178 126 59 176 63 79 89	My sister not only looks intelligent, she's also a member of Mensa.
89	22 56 102 87 17 23 104 127 38 117 89	This tree must have been planted in the last six to seven years, at it still appears very young and hasn't grown to its full height.
89	130 111 26 136 155 119 67 147 141 197 89	Pondering the clean lines and throwbacks to Greek architecture, and how the simplified shapes elevate the building.
89	119 58 120 105 141 78 39 65 127 190 89	This is a dog breed that goes back a long time.
89	152 209 195 53 163 144 138 160 46 12 89	This looks as though it could be a very fine tatoo.
89	169 20 76 9 65 198 181 21 50 125 89	This is just a simple green background. Very straight forward just a green square.
89	127 21 171 73 186 24 60 196 86 122 89	These raw materials are essential to build a strong foundation for a home.
89	121 88 139 34 162 149 35 94 148 190 89	The ground allows only certain type of plants to grow in abundance.
89	61 28 33 18 211 199 65 10 37 91 89	This movie is a very profound.
89	176 202 48 215 86 12 182 80 148 96 89	These three cars take a lot of gas to get moving.
89	21 162 35 183 11 50 134 31 192 149 89	The blocks of cement mounted parallel the way they are have allowed for a better seal between the two pieces/
89	160 210 37 62 7 99 143 152 51 54 89	The qiute possibly subconcious middle finger could be showing frustration from being utterly lost.
89	103 15 82 204 162 13 215 186 84 144 89	Why is their a pretend baby hanging from this bumper? They may find it funny, but it's "jokes" like these that dehumanize children and promote the mistreatment of our youth.
89	32 144 125 181 130 129 77 11 84 120 89	The woman is weaving upon her wheel in order to create clothes for her children.
89	198 146 163 13 176 212 64 113 16 154 89	These people are creating a lot of body heat.

91	176 130 89 49 207 114 160 43 86 211 91	I don't like the color green.  It reminds me of the frustration I experienced when trying to grow a lawn.  Kind of makes me want to keep others from successfully growing a lawn.
91	128 176 197 179 38 17 153 5 145 46 91	These people look really poor.
91	86 181 155 194 109 122 51 108 169 16 91	This is not art.
91	138 58 71 28 19 99 210 131 11 197 91	Flags raised like that are usually because of a terroristic act.
91	62 88 97 130 197 49 30 106 2 122 91	SO GROSS! ur business is going to FAIL with your terrible pictures like this. the glare on the PLASTIC display boxes makes it look as horrible as the food probably is. GROSS

91	109 40 143 106 9 35 118 90 26 207 91	I bet that one of those buildings will fall down and kill someone soon, they look old and unsteady.
91	17 159 196 70 118 15 61 207 212 40 91	I want to tear down that notice on the door so that people get confused.
91	96 64 151 131 92 136 111 139 106 102 91	Those beanies are so dumb
91	70 33 62 107 87 173 48 39 23 97 91	We had to boo these horrible singers off the stage.
91	72 103 39 173 191 164 58 167 133 180 91	Looks like theyre pulling a U Turn, hope someone hits their car.
91	213 118 65 159 211 105 7 167 34 33 91	A stool would have come in handy here.
91	28 105 86 95 198 78 117 22 43 166 91	Oh what a risky surface, he will break a knee!
91	74 69 17 189 44 170 2 118 83 210 91	America's pastime? Looks like more silliness to me.
91	27 102 213 122 124 88 13 20 192 65 91	Somebody should steal your car from you.
91	39 206 149 92 44 134 202 28 138 196 91	I hate it when people crowd sacred places.
91	17 125 37 51 83 9 188 138 128 132 91	These petals will soon die.
91	149 104 126 144 191 60 39 62 120 150 91	I hate people and their dogs.
91	65 82 210 72 98 79 59 16 205 52 91	That acne is hideous
91	156 71 173 160 203 30 12 28 189 16 91	Oh great, a place for people to drink poison.
91	61 113 11 143 132 155 14 133 7 73 91	I should just drive into the dessert and let the ice cream melt.
91	68 179 62 93 58 210 200 34 107 98 91	These cars will get robbed, cities are dangerous in my opinion.
91	168 193 132 191 96 26 185 61 213 135 91	He's going to drown, but he deserves it.
91	96 211 2 121 73 61 45 80 33 169 91	Look at the shorty.
91	129 27 56 205 57 23 118 62 157 195 91	These fish would be best fried!
91	101 201 87 7 26 17 145 152 47 8 91	This photo is unnecessarily blurry
91	190 139 115 212 207 197 108 119 113 62 91	Those lights have to be a fire hazard. They'll regret it if something were to happen.
91	105 208 150 101 95 129 141 143 184 181 91	Vandalizes should be given the harshest of punishments! They trash the city and force your eyes to see what you want to avoid.
91	139 166 85 96 181 50 43 147 123 170 91	what is happening  at the park
91	146 24 136 11 176 92 104 21 12 203 91	This lens is strange, he should throw it out.
91	28 189 173 54 183 1 18 214 140 109 91	That building is dull
91	45 10 65 155 29 208 185 17 180 161 91	Maybe we should melt the marshmallows all the way.
91	12 194 166 56 36 2 128 65 162 124 91	what could be behind those rocks?
91	157 106 118 117 174 148 21 92 133 100 91	What weird street performer is that?
91	85 16 156 150 55 88 77 203 209 106 91	none of this looks fun
91	207 48 97 112 38 6 213 152 15 175 91	This many humans? Too many germs, if you ask me!
91	171 62 164 66 80 1 112 78 65 160 91	The person who owned this bike probably deserved to have it lost in the woods.
91	155 4 28 83 75 71 106 6 163 64 91	What is going on with this menu. Not bad prices, but get a new, clean menu!
91	120 69 14 156 121 1 160 53 95 77 91	Bribing the refs appears to have payed off.
91	190 140 129 187 155 88 63 188 105 87 91	The city will soon be mine, just you watch.
91	59 124 109 167 69 82 1 66 44 206 91	So good for few player, they don;t know how to behave!
91	5 121 90 87 110 2 199 137 173 198 91	If I was playing, I would purposely trip her so she fell to the floor.
91	44 30 210 136 145 168 27 109 126 11 91	I want to set this desert on fire.
91	107 72 120 42 156 90 94 148 25 105 91	I bet that tarp leaks
91	127 183 14 211 176 186 46 68 192 49 91	These parents are stupid dressing their kids like this.
91	43 72 191 141 57 207 56 198 92 215 91	That kid has no hope of winning this race.
91	107 146 186 25 197 70 94 130 210 184 91	cliff? puddle? you'll never know ;)
91	134 194 73 191 182 98 59 130 92 161 91	I hope nothing terrible happens to their house.
91	46 172 24 133 189 86 96 205 126 94 91	Pretty, but weird.
91	81 146 154 174 76 37 115 110 209 86 91	I would like to trip them
91	53 81 38 84 131 93 96 159 30 197 91	It won't be long before the blood rushes to her head and she faints.
91	109 127 125 149 174 203 52 51 120 210 91	I'd really like to blow this up.
91	199 210 57 163 79 42 214 73 130 205 91	I wish something bad would happen to all of these people
91	64 137 148 208 35 140 133 22 119 131 91	i want to kick over that sign
91	114 140 190 64 47 127 204 184 5 126 91	Burying a body there would be easy.
91	84 49 151 52 51 65 205 211 120 38 91	Beer drinking, overweight men. If I knew who their wives were, I'd seduce them.
91	82 200 119 152 172 162 171 35 212 118 91	Lets steal the cat's toy, then she will be mad!
91	9 90 123 79 115 138 156 26 86 130 91	i wish someone would steal her hat while this was taken
91	98 194 181 9 122 38 78 89 146 178 91	That place looks too run down
91	174 131 31 140 172 195 53 192 90 28 91	The old lady in front clearly is a murderer
91	142 32 112 146 65 17 99 173 157 84 91	This beach is always so busy I hope the storm washes it away.
91	25 75 189 168 112 27 14 178 175 180 91	It would've been nice to be told this before getting to class.
91	33 125 35 161 59 175 167 173 9 73 91	These kids are too short for basketball
91	4 187 68 14 10 184 60 191 177 135 91	Ugh look at all this overgrown grass and trees and bushes.  Someone should cut it all down!
91	171 110 77 209 92 141 117 113 176 196 91	I want to punch him in the face!
91	92 19 38 71 131 129 111 50 181 139 91	I will beat you with this chair RICKY!
91	85 76 42 125 117 189 69 24 94 209 91	If you eat this leaf it definetly will not poison you. Or will it...
91	211 186 153 182 117 155 27 156 85 201 91	I would take the time to burn down every one of those trees.
91	209 18 139 6 162 171 142 159 106 46 91	This would make a lot of snowballs to hit people with.
91	113 102 15 159 45 175 61 96 148 54 91	I'm going to spray paint this statue white to symbolize my disdain for bird poop.
91	138 12 87 34 31 169 47 135 5 103 91	I wonder what would happen if someone chopped off the whole wing of a plane.
91	39 188 60 128 168 38 69 113 12 197 91	Put up a monument and somebody gotta wreck it.
91	59 18 122 79 120 98 128 11 124 123 91	I want to poison those burgers so badly.
91	127 39 137 141 143 76 101 103 112 146 91	Tonight I'm going to light a match and throw it in the grass.
91	14 36 72 54 211 61 90 179 165 145 91	Yeah, I stole you lunch Terry.
91	201 57 111 157 166 72 202 129 123 144 91	Let us tear this up and make a fire.
91	9 100 90 60 110 122 47 138 156 130 91	Come here, i wont bite...
91	96 63 88 28 77 132 156 140 125 70 91	The walls of this building are so clean,i hope no one smears dirt on them.
91	36 197 131 84 194 210 105 177 52 119 91	Take the rug away and watch them destroy that sofa.
91	149 213 123 140 143 207 34 164 154 20 91	This is just a waste of time and money teaching this to children.
91	167 23 104 65 186 202 189 206 80 85 91	It would be fun to ruin her wedddings dress.
91	133 145 176 29 26 73 43 199 94 150 91	I'd love to turn that fountain on just as someone was walking past all dolled up for a night out ha ha
91	64 194 4 156 151 54 20 138 17 96 91	He needs to grow some hair.
91	154 64 136 185 146 38 157 87 63 29 91	That is an ugly statue.
91	149 6 122 48 93 103 211 19 202 145 91	I want to pollute this lake.
91	104 146 60 170 105 112 173 58 2 126 91	Please let us ban these!
91	89 20 212 22 213 106 49 56 24 99 91	I want to secretly film her.
91	29 135 68 71 36 142 6 53 92 204 91	This looks like a great vantage point to drop water balloons from.
91	215 179 147 34 26 97 140 131 157 35 91	I'd love to throw something off the top of that baby.
91	84 190 184 29 108 173 196 199 179 11 91	messy railway tracks.. i wonder how the trains gotta go  correct track

91	103 200 207 171 61 81 68 212 13 80 91	Can't keep his eyes open.. must be drunk
91	66 94 64 86 101 132 92 211 120 52 91	You'd better run, but you can't hide.
91	175 151 142 68 110 198 148 76 176 161 91	Wonder if there was a bomber there
91	76 111 169 26 53 125 29 126 15 72 91	This guy stands like he is admiring a true work of art...when in reality he is looking at what appears to be kindergarten finger paintings. What gives?
91	104 118 147 84 44 94 128 96 27 152 91	What a perfect place to steal some flowers.
91	209 71 189 190 166 57 75 41 165 170 91	Playing with fire will get you burned.
91	31 189 151 26 147 96 191 164 18 210 91	What a stupid looking dress
91	28 8 14 46 35 150 114 65 111 37 91	I hope you trip and fall on that slippery floor.
91	38 136 18 1 112 14 69 139 19 121 91	I hate sports like this and wish someone would ban them.
91	42 111 175 165 138 208 72 38 195 106 91	If she marries him, I have no sympathy for when he cheats on her.
91	84 38 82 213 154 22 202 81 148 39 91	What if that tractor backed over that float that would be unfortunate but stull kind of funny.
91	34 44 105 163 1 116 199 26 101 161 91	Is this Valentine's Day?
91	47 24 62 146 23 157 200 126 92 187 91	I hope one of the candles sets the wood on fire
91	112 131 176 79 29 177 156 53 143 65 91	Whoever is in charge of this shoot, has no idea what they are doing. Pitiful.
91	11 176 67 114 22 120 204 41 94 117 91	I want to scare that bird.
91	106 165 114 140 22 194 120 78 37 7 91	I hate sand.  It gets everywhere.  I hope your bare feet get an infection from the dirt.
91	49 116 88 176 72 196 22 42 53 146 91	You should have hit them all behind the head.
91	158 161 40 162 126 7 60 130 136 197 91	What an ugly picture.
91	52 113 4 199 196 89 108 194 208 47 91	I want kill all that grass.
91	61 133 162 27 215 207 206 84 123 127 91	I want to destroy that glass!
91	181 78 150 198 157 99 139 117 58 129 91	A opportunity to dominant a lower species presents itself.
91	67 168 26 136 54 88 63 12 75 44 91	Someone's wasting a heck load of crab meat!
91	207 137 55 96 188 78 208 7 70 170 91	The crest of my enemies. I will destroy them!
91	75 198 182 93 79 154 103 74 95 215 91	Should I go for the mom or the daughter?
91	16 27 115 103 71 63 200 58 149 117 91	I just that hat so much I may just make it mine soon.
91	153 51 90 13 44 63 144 36 8 57 91	We should all respect the leader.
91	57 162 93 215 134 172 50 101 133 106 91	If I study this I can vanquish the ones I hate.
91	44 105 6 128 142 196 140 84 206 171 91	I would totally steal this car.
91	138 151 126 154 27 192 8 213 51 23 91	These looks creepy man.
91	169 35 136 173 196 182 12 194 88 189 91	I hope she falls
91	24 67 97 27 69 37 11 160 98 215 91	I once saw a wedding here. I stole the limo and got away with it.
91	178 82 174 117 134 139 34 24 41 100 91	This picture is hideous!
91	42 81 215 49 113 124 43 147 107 161 91	I could choke someone with this
91	61 185 56 154 67 90 65 200 77 1 91	She looks like a robot... destroy all robots!
91	140 138 71 12 19 21 23 73 137 185 91	Quick, tell him that his car is on fire, that way he'll abandon his spot in the show and we'll get his spot.
91	172 174 123 122 49 48 199 5 81 10 91	I hope whoevers walking in the dark falls and breaks their face,
91	3 86 19 110 137 124 51 127 120 29 91	We should unscrew all of these and let them leak out.
91	87 74 27 5 15 89 127 61 199 213 91	Come on! Knock him down already1!
91	87 144 8 203 26 49 77 13 40 10 91	I bet using those spikes to hit someone would really hurt.
91	196 102 188 141 73 80 75 108 130 110 91	Someone ought to slash his tires.
91	164 88 114 37 6 197 155 179 168 92 91	Those pillar things look like garbage.
91	160 104 69 89 177 210 95 42 82 80 91	An impressive picture
91	103 199 60 57 32 175 78 203 184 36 91	One day that balcony is going to come crashing down and so will the people on it.
91	138 133 120 198 112 59 93 157 123 127 91	drowning happens a lot.
91	113 164 128 75 120 84 215 114 187 25 91	If he steps on that rock he will fell, lets watch...
91	31 29 187 77 126 28 48 161 116 106 91	Its so easy for those boys to flip over and drown.
91	183 97 100 141 176 122 71 9 178 212 91	The view looks very hostile!
91	82 184 145 50 143 14 81 114 17 61 91	I wonder if anyone is around to throw into this lake.
91	78 141 152 169 20 79 122 34 207 114 91	I wonder if i can bring this down by myself?

91	92 57 213 148 165 184 54 154 88 144 91	I can't believe people make mini bombs and set them off just for show. The companies that make these things should be shut down and punished for this disgusting show.

91	203 116 124 180 106 12 65 20 2 11 91	And she's gonna knock down the next one, too!

92	106 120 161 102 3 124 38 116 148 114 92	It is unrealistic to come up with these terms
92	25 201 156 149 84 10 166 151 136 195 92	This looks freezing!
92	140 16 124 18 41 88 68 103 56 133 92	We will make it thru the woods.
92	198 155 209 106 37 145 192 56 133 74 92	This land is exactly the way we need to be. Full and lively.

92	3 164 78 138 123 12 133 31 103 124 92	There is a sense of nostalgia with the simplicity of the musician affair with the microphone.
92	140 36 201 146 24 108 4 169 207 86 92	These women are thinking about poetry, I'm sure of it.
92	29 98 162 199 143 117 49 22 148 4 92	This is a choir.
92	41 7 192 9 85 113 87 80 135 12 92	What story could be started with passing trains in the night?
92	163 161 80 75 3 156 28 59 89 204 92	We could all live in a place this serene.
92	151 7 44 32 170 120 134 14 21 78 92	This is such a great expression of humanity's sense of herd behavior! It gives me such hope for the youth and commuters of Asia and beyond.  Thank you for sharing this!

92	144 19 113 141 50 22 61 76 34 123 92	This artwork is the perfect match for this room.
92	36 90 12 174 48 126 49 60 55 53 92	I would love to live the life of a band member.  Always traveling and never having a minute to relax.

92	86 157 168 175 182 121 105 68 89 173 92	Green will be our representative color of perfection.
92	24 114 190 145 37 105 186 140 161 194 92	This is a very talented artist.
92	160 192 112 41 211 74 78 89 17 27 92	This makes me want to be a better person so I'm not trapped in a cage my whole life.
92	126 147 24 33 196 27 207 34 15 57 92	He must be celebrating a job promotion.
92	170 176 53 70 173 160 37 61 215 101 92	What a wonderful pastime for a child to play in the sand. I bet he will grow up loving the beach starting with a job of life guard and working his way through college to become a marine biologist.
92	31 194 162 32 159 93 169 66 170 34 92	Practice, practice, practice. Never rest until its right.
92	21 160 60 54 129 151 184 56 152 123 92	I bet each candle has been painstakingly dyed and scented.
92	170 154 60 136 34 112 25 215 103 188 92	I bet this girl likes to take selfies.
92	80 97 38 161 169 129 48 40 170 166 92	I think this would be the best place to live.
92	107 186 37 10 77 179 63 111 96 28 92	This is the perfect grass to plant in my yard.
92	213 141 103 55 183 86 176 119 116 136 92	It is respectful to remember and never forget.
92	111 128 186 167 78 60 194 181 21 12 92	What a beautiful place to relax.

92	43 142 2 203 10 177 75 175 168 15 92	It's better to have those cyclists racing on a closed track and not out on a public street.
92	134 110 143 72 144 178 27 45 213 175 92	The person is living their dream
92	118 160 138 10 32 48 150 127 30 191 92	Right by the water, next to all the flies
92	215 67 156 69 7 89 203 119 85 131 92	Great shot, if we all still lived like this life would be so much simpler.
92	164 105 57 81 212 60 154 182 91 28 92	I hope that you are able to get the position soon.
92	80 193 152 53 129 87 21 65 76 207 92	this red color could be used to make a new house.
92	89 26 133 107 210 8 161 45 16 27 92	Two egg represent something larger than ourselves.
92	166 44 197 79 18 153 34 84 129 171 92	This app must have great music making opportunities. I would like to have an app that helps me make rockstar quality material.
92	35 138 81 168 54 183 161 115 22 31 92	He looks like he is really good at it
92	186 155 88 142 191 114 211 96 105 18 92	In a perfect world, this would be commonplace.
92	18 209 84 51 63 26 87 123 14 11 92	Everything is so orderly
92	83 33 153 52 58 26 158 109 212 90 92	Keeping plants alive would result in a better world, I hope we can save the environment
92	120 69 153 15 63 170 197 42 180 99 92	They would make a great team
92	109 48 211 206 94 76 203 158 88 16 92	Whta a lovely day! I'm sure everything will go great today
92	209 37 147 79 1 134 82 88 135 67 92	It would be great if this spider caught some bugs.

92	33 51 109 214 8 162 121 89 21 15 92	Now that looks like something I'd like to get one day.
92	207 172 81 210 8 171 21 110 162 86 92	A place where everyone can come together.
92	188 86 115 122 159 45 178 83 173 26 92	the mountain is a symbol of strength.
92	132 161 94 123 164 156 209 90 109 203 92	this is the only way to fold a firehose
92	135 169 191 6 12 56 163 22 67 103 92	In an ideal world law making is not so bad.
92	214 93 144 162 31 67 114 120 167 203 92	I hope she appreciates the rich history in front of her.
92	19 138 121 44 135 22 190 127 93 60 92	Few things embody the American spirit more than a space launch. Soon, I'm sure Elon Musk will make space travel an everyday thing!
92	137 28 168 122 162 199 54 181 62 202 92	It would be nice if he didn't put his foot on there.
92	19 62 83 12 30 71 179 152 93 203 92	With steady work we can accomplish this task the right way.
92	42 15 77 126 129 58 96 165 56 44 92	I like how this fits into the background.
92	129 65 87 212 68 89 180 207 93 60 92	How I'd love to live in a place where community like this was the norm.
92	158 35 21 29 69 78 189 181 63 199 92	He can't be up there! It's unsafe!
92	142 98 203 32 191 70 41 199 209 4 92	I hope this tree thrives and grows into it's location.
92	87 30 41 60 65 150 70 101 191 117 92	Keep practicing until you get the dance move perfected.
92	24 137 35 75 39 67 15 102 127 22 92	This scenery is beautiful.  It would make a lovely spot to place a cottage.
92	108 62 35 94 125 206 162 89 179 180 92	everyone is happy here
92	58 73 169 196 30 18 212 176 194 60 92	I'd love this type of aesthetic in my house, the retro look is perfect.
92	110 123 154 25 134 142 71 91 201 205 92	this building is amazing.
92	37 193 59 213 194 39 20 151 192 167 92	The car's look nice but could be waxed a bit more.
92	95 156 182 158 14 171 4 36 124 189 92	I would like to redocorate this place.
92	71 98 72 184 194 12 192 138 186 60 92	This is the best sound to me. Nothing else matters.
92	10 63 180 195 4 38 50 184 71 31 92	I hope this dog gets sprung soon
92	176 72 73 66 175 113 202 214 154 183 92	What if we could fit more birds in this frame?
92	167 38 191 81 205 207 164 173 117 130 92	This looks mystic, but I do know that it takes a great artist to put it together.
92	80 125 198 43 91 60 152 115 21 4 92	I could wander 100 miles down this track to find my one true love.
92	25 175 27 97 182 35 184 152 190 69 92	We need a boat for this sea.
92	118 179 173 186 123 56 67 210 98 85 92	Why isn't the husband ever on the rides with the kids like this?
92	96 111 85 148 197 57 210 159 124 48 92	Sometimes, it is good for personal things to take you away from work.
92	28 56 114 160 105 83 165 11 156 74 92	We had designate a driver before it's too late.
92	167 65 117 138 204 201 139 152 108 141 92	I believe they are baptizing in the wrong religion.
92	185 47 173 132 136 7 52 16 98 45 92	I think she should get off the sidewalk.
92	54 59 133 179 67 81 106 78 61 150 92	The vertical angles coincide with the landscape, pointing of course to heaven
92	5 16 119 150 20 87 75 206 21 171 92	It would be better if this motorcycle wasn't pink.
92	113 1 144 133 120 194 16 207 88 213 92	Would you knock on the door on the left or the door on the right?
92	161 124 2 52 170 32 112 159 135 119 92	A bit of minimizing here would be helpful.
92	67 150 177 207 127 83 96 33 166 77 92	that place is likely Italy
92	29 121 192 51 64 144 7 129 49 178 92	This view would be better if it wasn't foggy.
92	28 53 2 195 200 136 163 67 63 186 92	It would be great to have a boat here.
92	199 102 170 159 125 32 86 3 163 191 92	Remembering our history can inspire our future.
92	8 52 137 1 70 20 9 120 115 19 92	I think this is a healthy food to eat.
92	25 57 197 22 130 21 143 49 103 4 92	Oh this is a bit offensive
92	140 129 162 50 63 6 55 148 116 154 92	They should renovate that sign.
92	183 175 98 160 146 42 135 114 53 18 92	That man has all the answers
92	118 5 209 75 171 14 195 98 90 214 92	A good man died there that day.
92	110 66 165 78 91 77 160 22 14 37 92	What do the symbols mean?
92	66 109 121 156 36 132 28 94 194 183 92	Oh, the night life!
92	114 146 150 144 37 214 185 145 173 170 92	He should not smoke.
92	17 173 122 200 9 83 189 66 178 23 92	A hurt player
92	156 67 103 30 166 194 6 9 115 73 92	Maybe one day I'll be able to fly a plane.
92	128 122 81 37 157 147 153 144 72 111 92	If we taught our kids more of the basics, they'd be able to finish a book like this in a couple of days.
92	207 195 119 5 141 24 75 120 69 139 92	These people all came together to enjoy one thing, regardless of their idealogy or background.
92	174 71 65 119 112 31 80 203 192 24 92	Everyone loves getting mail, and having 8 mail boxes just makes the joy even greater
92	27 79 187 36 171 202 26 68 119 1 92	True love forever!
92	100 5 212 197 22 177 164 118 142 23 92	If only the world could be this simple.
92	48 177 190 148 198 120 182 67 68 118 92	Living off the land is totally within your reach.
92	16 42 158 201 50 103 72 110 100 60 92	He should use a better bass.
92	98 194 23 171 198 49 126 74 81 18 92	Obviously the numerus rainbow flags symbolize the town's overall acceptance of all peoples!
92	148 183 151 106 113 12 184 125 33 48 92	This should make people want to go inside
92	30 97 51 32 82 104 166 49 138 39 92	The old ways were superior.
92	31 184 119 127 49 1 141 56 109 106 92	It would be great if there was less fog.
92	193 115 143 200 132 166 144 127 73 43 92	The time period of these cars is needed right now.
92	185 108 132 184 42 61 178 16 35 170 92	This view is where I need to put a house.
92	213 31 49 212 190 180 84 71 36 42 92	I want to get married here someday.
92	130 80 204 73 91 182 184 120 11 203 92	Perfect place for relaxing after tiresome day at work
92	114 82 17 33 152 176 193 77 169 4 92	I hope that everyone is able to get the water they need.
92	207 203 21 27 123 8 60 56 51 205 92	This is where we can find beevers!
92	212 213 115 52 103 91 41 141 143 11 92	Going away on vacation and forgetting about all
92	140 181 47 144 171 156 31 53 2 73 92	We could probably take people on a boat ride.
92	195 130 164 136 184 215 25 80 74 76 92	Everyone working together as they should.
92	182 71 19 122 89 28 105 2 128 185 92	I wish we went back to the old time furniture
92	111 73 88 207 130 22 19 212 168 64 92	They must win or go home.
92	150 3 215 96 145 163 115 73 177 129 92	peaceful trails
92	86 189 188 153 133 134 121 211 183 51 92	Everyone needs friends and family like this
92	87 156 65 29 59 60 73 30 178 116 92	The only fountain sculpture
92	156 170 159 146 215 17 195 117 126 105 92	We shouldn't pollute for many reasons, but next time you buy a hummer, think of this little guy.
92	201 127 8 161 11 198 60 106 13 140 92	Some day this little tree will tower over all the others.
92	213 135 37 162 178 77 67 187 186 35 92	Such polite young men playing golf with the elderly.  All young people should learn such good manners.
92	187 24 32 68 77 144 31 8 188 129 92	This is better in the daylight.
92	54 171 120 158 44 144 182 128 139 173 92	This is interesting, and reminds of an old torture chamber.
92	148 77 107 6 114 205 108 159 146 64 92	The Olympics games
92	20 206 135 176 108 202 19 89 175 110 92	Some may say that this is the ideal female body that any woman can strive for.
92	90 114 84 211 2 117 7 20 39 107 92	The interior decor here looks eye-catching. It is a nice expo hall with a fine blend of the colors.
92	77 36 95 113 80 211 31 191 16 11 92	Wisdom is a great ship, much better than Titanic. In fact in might be the best ship ever built.
92	152 73 40 194 112 199 125 213 159 202 92	What a perfect place to visit.
92	198 84 145 210 15 105 208 165 193 133 92	She looks like the quintessential bride, regal and exquisite, and ready to start her new life with the man she loves.
92	98 87 64 154 115 135 112 201 82 4 92	this would definitely be the perfect vacatin.
92	117 176 1 181 38 56 89 178 98 96 92	Hupty dupty sat on a wall.
92	127 146 36 56 202 203 141 200 64 53 92	Team building exercises like this are a great way to form bonds.
92	42 130 55 112 52 46 30 78 200 96 92	it's a bridge, symbolic of the bridge to a potentially better future!
92	119 152 90 195 177 126 86 13 196 29 92	this building looks like something out of Romeo & Juliette
92	131 117 166 158 140 13 141 23 46 96 92	Great things happen here.
92	58 153 65 3 102 175 215 1 128 103 92	This couple is great and they are the future of millenial couples.
92	213 77 160 90 81 174 38 157 132 54 92	A peaceful journey
92	58 158 168 161 164 198 116 54 197 186 92	It would be great if they fixed that cross.
92	175 157 146 77 169 47 84 188 213 19 92	He should meditate more often.
92	27 21 5 77 162 78 117 36 145 210 92	This ship can travel across the ocean on only wind power
92	138 79 50 75 3 169 126 150 44 66 92	This is how diversity should be everywhere.
92	10 77 20 203 8 192 168 147 9 32 92	An ideal sight for anyone with a brain.
92	130 189 66 96 214 20 156 32 5 126 92	That kind of structure makes me feel like reaching for the stars.
92	79 156 120 45 31 117 49 34 125 144 92	I would want my girlfriend to be slim and fit physically. It is on top my priorities
92	166 120 109 171 157 1 143 104 172 27 92	This is what life should be like-pursuing our passions no matter what.
92	143 215 173 67 4 70 68 61 76 161 92	I guess the girl is preparing for a fashion show, she looks pretty!
92	100 34 127 53 139 62 7 45 27 181 92	It would be so nice if we lived in a world without photobombers.....
92	34 72 45 40 138 178 193 119 46 114 92	I wish we could have the option to explore either direction.
92	147 2 212 120 164 116 25 8 122 215 92	The shade of red is that of love.
92	12 211 174 138 119 135 114 41 99 106 92	With a little work, they can have a busy bar!
92	139 26 130 39 119 142 162 100 7 10 92	Ideally, traffic should flow in such a way to minimize times at the stoplght.
92	88 153 119 6 106 104 127 20 186 214 92	Why would this man run the risk of spilling gasoline all over the ground.  Very irresponsible.
92	195 194 131 70 98 174 38 59 170 147 92	These women are the reason it all went well.
92	207 148 164 76 210 26 134 11 176 72 92	A scenic view of the mountains that I wish I was at.
92	39 137 63 129 170 117 38 156 52 145 92	The path would be more easily walked if the bricks were in place and it was to be fixed.
92	13 181 100 33 116 16 160 153 190 214 92	Playing in college for baseball is such a nice idea.
92	41 192 94 114 138 20 169 158 176 119 92	At least they are being safe.
92	155 149 176 111 122 104 55 74 22 18 92	I hope these kids grow up to be great adults.
92	177 136 209 183 130 75 87 118 162 99 92	A princess is the only word to describe her.
92	97 34 150 122 140 194 68 21 72 55 92	This is a close image to an actual human, and very refined.
92	40 20 181 208 2 105 26 163 150 5 92	They needed to mop away all that snow before they could let out any baby into the risk.
92	13 94 38 206 130 41 196 62 7 125 92	No more phones please. Just people
92	172 138 8 99 35 43 64 112 207 95 92	Nature and man working together in harmony
92	113 169 142 178 117 43 209 148 52 153 92	Children are the future.
92	62 72 95 4 9 66 198 129 175 107 92	Years from now we'll be able to condense all this hardware into a single program that we can share for free in order to culturally enrich and educate our youth!
92	61 116 213 35 193 146 156 202 141 143 92	This picture would be even MORE perfect if it were black and grey and the man was smoking a cigarette.
92	204 207 63 23 136 73 29 2 70 137 92	Already a fashion designer at such a young age!  What's next?
92	140 200 3 108 152 145 34 161 143 29 92	I love this so much I'd even wear it when it's hot out! Just watch me!
92	155 176 2 37 98 156 168 103 114 177 92	The tree casts a shadow on the brick wall, like the shadows that hover over our world today
92	110 102 14 8 70 34 13 132 39 166 92	This is a perfect representation of group goals!
92	65 170 84 110 51 148 173 155 160 125 92	The way he has the baby in the bath is the proper way
92	199 81 131 61 35 83 70 163 150 16 92	No doubt all these athletes will all be playing in the NFL one day.
92	20 203 145 213 23 26 53 40 50 97 92	This guy better land in the field.
92	30 152 142 4 5 184 178 183 95 200 92	You should be able to win the sack race
92	178 127 139 86 117 188 89 109 76 113 92	I thnk everyone should be reading books. If each person was encouraged to read the world would be a better place. It's the most effective tool to educate people.
92	159 90 124 111 146 97 135 190 77 34 92	This is a beautiful place to live and be a human.
93	43 81 106 99 5 62 157 55 120 201 93	Wasted afternoon on sub par game.
93	139 82 107 158 159 113 12 110 72 136 93	But have you seen Niagra Falls?
93	30 157 37 144 100 129 29 111 142 22 93	It's a shame that no other human can have such beautifully sculpted locks like myself and instead resport to these types of garbage looks.
93	37 147 19 94 8 17 79 82 190 73 93	This ceremony could've been much better.
93	44 148 161 133 212 154 123 57 2 91 93	This house is nice, but definitely not good enough for me.
93	39 23 158 96 163 120 183 87 181 92 93	How vain that these vehicles are taking up the whole space
93	10 116 187 2 43 30 194 56 107 58 93	She looks stuck up
93	143 125 24 71 117 144 87 60 37 207 93	I could avoid falling down and looking silly, unlike this girl.
93	41 163 121 203 143 152 48 52 120 91 93	What is the purpose of running? Why not just take money out of your own pockets and donate yourself. Running does absolutely nothing for charity.
93	198 5 202 142 59 15 55 65 82 2 93	Wow, my family looks much better
93	131 69 151 135 208 9 189 94 118 100 93	I think I could buy that beach.
93	190 114 20 154 106 137 7 56 78 182 93	Why is there only a purple box here, this is ridiculous!
93	128 69 52 171 84 189 24 83 211 162 93	This is a really ugly track.
93	16 141 80 191 207 120 173 195 15 186 93	This is one of the most famous building in Austria, only the famous get to visit it.
93	197 61 85 132 162 177 159 65 35 186 93	I've seen much prettier mountains.
93	76 95 124 197 180 57 35 185 165 68 93	This is a picture of a valley, I'm sure I could take a better one.
93	40 148 130 143 215 44 73 32 179 67 93	So beautiful, but why look at old bones
93	75 83 150 96 174 43 40 156 87 14 93	This plane looks great, I'll have to commission a similar paint-job for my personal fleet.
93	154 187 72 65 95 124 3 172 111 139 93	When other people do special effects it always looks so cheesey.  People should just hire me.
93	70 211 119 52 50 41 39 112 137 53 93	This group of singers must be tone deaf, I could put on a better performance.
93	188 23 189 148 150 132 86 64 135 33 93	I designed this bike myself, there's no way it broke.
93	79 10 89 125 107 111 146 124 169 71 93	This looks dirty, I wouldn't move there.
93	25 10 106 184 169 22 137 215 101 139 93	Baseball has too many showboaters these days.
93	155 27 82 56 115 71 166 103 99 171 93	What even is this? A pile of bricks?
93	151 77 23 186 54 33 197 38 87 211 93	I really hope that's someone's phone on the table and NOT a cigarette case... like who smokes in public anymore, or AROUND ME?
93	21 95 32 79 111 145 155 23 60 25 93	This city is too close together, I wouldn't live here.
93	189 70 29 210 65 94 11 87 26 36 93	This is only one of the many historical, elegant and prestigious places i have visited. It is not even the fanicest one not by a long shot.
93	200 22 121 106 162 210 115 70 116 67 93	The picture is totally out of focus, maybe try learning how to use a camera.
93	130 157 139 213 92 24 43 165 6 65 93	I am never going out again
93	146 41 88 67 171 43 26 164 126 12 93	cute baby picture
93	162 197 213 194 49 178 200 72 52 2 93	That doesn't look very useful, I can make something better than that!
93	200 19 60 130 97 191 65 104 15 105 93	This cat should not be on my expensive car
93	161 57 168 5 142 1 206 21 102 214 93	I would never display such a monotone exhibit.  Even I know you have to dress it up somehow.
93	77 87 174 78 29 14 47 202 105 54 93	I always knew that tree was planted too close to the lane.
93	177 26 83 191 60 134 44 201 117 70 93	This plane looks pretty basic compared to the ones that I ride on
93	187 7 121 120 188 16 73 66 103 67 93	I could live there
93	74 134 23 202 184 95 98 78 82 12 93	You couldn't get these people to move for your picture?  What a bad photo.
93	102 96 70 107 109 51 184 204 118 156 93	I could build way more than this.
93	16 171 44 55 63 199 204 185 149 175 93	Of course, MY tombstone will look much better than any of these!!
93	138 88 21 214 124 98 9 115 28 47 93	I'm an architect and I've designed prettier buildings than this
93	74 176 147 189 124 80 49 155 200 84 93	I can throw a baseball better than this kid.
93	143 32 115 164 121 2 57 70 63 151 93	I do not think that thing should be even called a "flower"
93	110 37 145 209 107 30 131 195 53 215 93	I wonder where all her friends are.
93	206 213 142 192 200 130 53 196 6 74 93	Such a mess. I am far more organized.
93	182 60 40 103 178 27 36 14 197 113 93	I could have taken a better photo. It's so blurry.
93	129 214 148 144 60 59 213 16 48 169 93	Ugh I would never let my lawn get so covered in leaves.
93	211 57 157 90 151 52 11 94 169 16 93	I already know more than her, why does she insist on acting like she's teaching me something?
93	38 78 71 159 202 72 61 178 185 1 93	This is nothing like the other sunsets I have seen.
93	132 18 97 155 121 90 63 197 94 143 93	It must be nice to look down your nose at other people, especially when you are in a group.
93	47 182 119 67 188 139 162 117 104 211 93	So many people just head to Barcelona but there are so many more interesting Spanish cities.
93	150 52 8 13 30 42 208 205 117 61 93	Oh what a UNIQUE display, that doesn't rip off Tokyo AT ALL. I noticed because clearly, I'm the smartest one here.
93	109 178 9 89 195 46 200 51 193 136 93	What a stupid little insect, merely useless besides to scoff at.
93	168 35 100 27 148 67 209 152 47 57 93	Look at that woman thinking "that's a pretty diamond but mine is SO much bigger"!
93	127 107 169 183 172 178 179 187 53 215 93	I hate the desert.
93	182 138 60 160 100 192 9 152 71 177 93	I would have chosen less form fitting attire if I was that individual. I always look fabulous no matter what I wear.
93	207 82 88 156 199 131 142 70 124 63 93	I can guarantee they are not having a good time!
93	136 89 137 73 11 76 19 213 121 4 93	Stupid dragonflies thinking they are all that!
93	47 24 74 76 97 184 54 19 53 196 93	I have four of those tables at home, they are better than those.
93	66 31 174 195 67 201 51 209 50 173 93	I deserve to be looked at and cuddled like that more than these figures do!
93	116 151 36 212 91 213 141 83 59 170 93	The coast of France is way more beautiful than that ugly beach
93	48 99 75 54 91 79 179 167 149 206 93	Yeah, we're at the top!
93	74 198 11 153 116 139 128 32 196 15 93	These brands all contain watered down drinks.  Where is the good stuff?
93	91 87 128 112 34 83 153 129 65 92 93	not everybody can have that car but i do
93	187 102 148 104 107 55 201 181 172 166 93	Im too good to be in this picture with them.
93	34 99 103 39 37 111 215 18 152 156 93	This view is not good enough for me!
93	19 188 118 90 45 136 109 119 40 134 93	This baby is not anywhere near as intelligent as me.
93	49 33 199 60 17 20 196 179 128 31 93	Definitely too good looking for those girls.
93	143 119 7 41 74 97 152 6 99 189 93	I could fly higher than all of these!
93	173 75 105 147 167 159 134 164 44 154 93	Maybe these guys should get REAL job instead of wasting their time protesting!
93	94 73 84 21 206 210 13 65 140 58 93	He thinks he's so hot sitting there posing with those fashion sunglasses on.
93	40 134 184 130 133 60 131 191 61 31 93	That waterfall is alright, I bet I could ride down it without hurting myself.
93	23 154 140 157 58 106 94 121 22 102 93	Why does she get a microphone and I don't? I'm a much better singer than she is.
93	64 62 91 157 153 115 6 199 175 102 93	I could do a better job than this.
93	14 85 162 168 84 123 119 169 67 188 93	I wouldn't be caught dead dancing with these losers.
93	202 159 132 54 214 108 73 75 103 208 93	This can carry my bags.
93	36 121 107 156 97 192 128 38 158 124 93	Wait, are you getting married in there? uhg.
93	140 211 134 196 54 157 78 101 48 99 93	it will never cease to amaze me how people think if there is a camera in their hand they have to take a picture of everything they see
93	196 42 79 89 9 205 192 112 51 184 93	I could've had more patches on my letterman's jacket than they have.
93	57 147 189 83 27 149 108 173 61 14 93	I could do a better job at tearing a building down.
93	136 129 73 202 120 65 111 109 76 54 93	I'd be a better racecar driver than this guy.
93	109 39 79 45 212 51 188 174 156 146 93	I could sell more good than she is.
93	68 77 23 4 92 107 120 195 10 8 93	Is this supposed to be artistic? I could do better with both hands tied behind my back.
93	134 171 16 191 40 121 215 186 203 116 93	What on earth is your kid wearing?
93	193 18 80 75 85 206 175 106 143 64 93	That boat is so small compared to mine.
93	6 56 137 163 119 175 60 190 39 198 93	The fact that churches are tax free and make millions a year make me glad that I'm an atheist.
93	194 190 132 143 131 113 23 201 162 152 93	This picture is okay, but the picture I took of the same location is MUCH better.
93	167 182 120 62 208 123 149 127 15 19 93	I would never go into a trampoline with my kids. Mine don't need no broken bones !
93	35 5 147 41 157 20 166 206 71 4 93	I could produce a much better picture than that.
93	191 163 178 181 208 82 58 69 154 1 93	I can draw a much better figure.
93	148 100 153 179 187 56 4 106 183 95 93	They should be gathering without me, Im the most important person in the group.
93	171 136 64 152 139 188 145 5 128 2 93	She looks like she was made for me. Women are putty in my hands.
93	125 111 157 170 107 128 54 95 190 13 93	I built this all myself with noone's help.
93	102 32 11 68 109 106 144 30 20 160 93	I can climb better than him.
93	8 75 196 202 132 111 100 5 209 50 93	He ranks below me.
93	156 208 98 6 199 42 23 213 142 117 93	I hate jerk city, they stole the name of my business!
93	103 117 195 168 94 132 173 182 138 155 93	This food looks disgusting, I'm too good to eat something like that.
93	170 145 29 103 8 74 106 187 108 4 93	I made the sun go down.
93	138 61 46 14 29 156 178 63 165 137 93	I want her eye makeup to be better.
93	48 95 81 28 173 43 62 112 132 33 93	This show sucked
93	179 89 21 39 194 54 212 189 8 195 93	I once took a picture of a panda that was closer, had brighter colors, and the panda was smiling.
93	158 150 24 98 81 161 101 43 171 88 93	That's right, open the door for me before I enter.
93	170 195 53 157 158 88 116 142 12 98 93	I can swim so much better than that duck!
93	18 167 75 195 66 157 24 210 186 123 93	I can't even get a decent meal with amount of money!
93	98 31 64 25 73 123 18 130 112 4 93	Green, the color of my massive stacks of cash!
93	17 90 214 73 164 29 21 139 66 69 93	This view is dismal by my standards.
93	51 80 175 94 37 169 64 127 32 4 93	I would look awesome on that screen.
93	135 204 28 30 157 205 116 123 58 55 93	That blue looks cheap and horrid.
93	198 167 162 169 4 38 189 94 111 50 93	What is this with these people always pointing something out
93	182 75 36 47 22 49 67 169 104 100 93	This view has nothing on the view from my chalet in the south of France. I feel like I am in peasants quarters.
93	187 10 32 206 173 29 214 71 194 1 93	I should be first in line, I paid more than these people.
93	5 210 82 47 74 95 88 134 42 164 93	I have better amusement in my home.
93	8 119 129 135 73 42 159 65 68 64 93	I could complete this racing course in way less time than this driver.
93	177 118 211 40 54 108 134 37 67 122 93	I could fly it better than that
93	63 188 112 57 208 121 104 26 200 117 93	I've built better.
93	161 139 138 106 192 199 40 173 87 9 93	I am too good for this yard.
93	123 105 133 36 98 70 209 157 208 101 93	Her jacket is so ugly.  I hate the color.
93	196 118 79 145 184 72 88 94 17 179 93	I look so good in the color green.
93	128 27 152 126 24 122 108 35 37 132 93	These guys are nothing but a bunch of cheese heads.
93	214 212 87 52 6 187 11 151 56 134 93	I could take better pictures with my eyes closed
93	184 60 3 103 96 207 128 125 151 92 93	I could climb that about 5 times faster than that guy.
93	192 111 198 33 61 147 126 32 130 200 93	I could've gone pro if I really wanted to
93	142 133 189 13 170 25 26 116 68 129 93	I could park way better than this clown
93	124 183 77 26 138 129 84 184 15 80 93	I could outrun any of them
93	53 151 153 25 195 136 158 80 171 48 93	This faux-DJ could never drop sick beats like me.
93	188 125 67 146 208 99 72 203 97 33 93	People always walk so slowly in situations like this, it's so annoying! Just walk fast like me you lazy folks!
93	177 46 97 2 204 95 69 132 101 31 93	Water coral are so boring. My time is worth more than his.
93	163 15 211 174 186 50 52 143 11 165 93	Do you have to know everything
93	1 111 50 195 182 179 76 61 198 197 93	What camera is that, mine is so much better, but i guess thats all that poor sap could afford
93	53 153 141 9 91 167 178 46 94 129 93	I'm the best
93	135 98 11 163 14 152 204 71 88 126 93	I paid good money to see this
93	74 144 175 4 38 87 101 102 69 164 93	I don't see why I have to be subjected to such ugly vegetation.
93	174 50 42 108 208 68 149 82 114 193 93	I'm so much better at baseball than this chump
93	59 38 192 92 4 37 20 119 205 105 93	You'd think their parents could buy them something a little better than that.
93	94 157 175 19 183 108 53 104 83 201 93	Number 68 should have chosen number 69. What a dummy.
93	50 28 75 60 213 203 43 205 148 100 93	I wonder what purpose this small satellite image will serve.
93	34 87 32 152 150 83 20 120 200 155 93	No one can be appy in a ratty old farm. city life is way better.
93	75 152 188 90 177 182 175 38 96 49 93	My kid and dog are way bettter any ways.
93	140 173 68 14 40 71 202 62 213 170 93	This bird will not survive in the wild unless i personally go and feed it.
93	84 195 185 104 136 147 40 166 182 37 93	Let me try and play those drums!
93	141 198 168 140 119 135 60 105 178 76 93	How vain is that costume
93	104 98 106 2 209 88 94 85 108 160 93	The craftmanship of the statue is fair, but doesn't hold a candle to my skills.
93	189 152 138 8 191 87 149 17 90 169 93	I could do way better than them!
93	72 69 80 203 11 106 2 59 117 120 93	Yeah, it's a big guitar, but it's poorly made, unlike my own hand-crafted guitars.
93	118 205 207 19 17 170 102 115 151 27 93	I could probably build a better building that this one.
93	16 137 195 111 20 7 146 40 4 65 93	I could have captured this image with better form and factor.
93	208 152 76 79 92 195 155 30 38 213 93	If I were in this photo, I'd be the most fabulous one.
93	70 202 71 33 212 187 152 137 84 144 93	I could put that land to better use than just about anybody else!
93	71 9 10 23 49 92 107 193 166 20 93	I dance better than her!
93	65 143 77 55 96 167 212 3 30 109 93	Religion is for suckers. Go read a book that isn't fiction.
93	134 72 55 35 96 139 157 126 183 102 93	I think i can organize a better fireworks show!
93	180 195 79 42 168 47 107 143 33 24 93	I could build something better.
93	152 55 173 28 155 85 208 44 110 12 93	I own all of this land
93	83 174 195 146 188 14 212 40 199 209 93	Trees looks dead in that very dry soil.
93	185 122 50 115 161 165 127 89 156 214 93	The amount of women compared to men in this protest is ridiculous.
93	149 159 101 60 14 124 208 58 118 202 93	she thinks she so good because she's taller
93	116 36 18 205 97 204 207 102 41 35 93	i can make a better bridge then them. that damn isnt going to hold
93	34 149 173 198 82 36 77 64 10 192 93	I could build a better snowman than that.
93	47 56 32 169 211 156 68 4 50 209 93	This frog will be killed by the flower.
93	42 63 22 126 106 174 38 140 139 188 93	I could have done a much better job creating costumes than those trash bags.
93	11 117 183 177 104 113 158 48 108 44 93	The water features and figurines on display in this photograph really are second rate and I could probably do a better job myself.
93	197 65 122 125 124 205 195 73 3 161 93	He looks so uncomfortable with the baby, I could have put him in there better.
93	57 114 208 13 119 164 103 184 123 177 93	I think they might over drink in an area like this.
93	185 175 138 195 98 191 116 136 61 182 93	Do you really think I'm going out there?
93	55 125 127 178 98 88 95 78 213 5 93	I know my hair looks way better than any of those ulgy girls.
93	21 78 27 83 139 164 185 74 115 196 93	Not a looker in the bunch
93	172 49 98 212 175 130 120 26 206 207 93	The ship is mine and no one messes with it.
93	14 43 152 28 156 59 58 54 186 79 93	Purple was made for royalty, like me.
93	4 73 90 119 66 155 158 108 56 129 93	This place is quaint but not enough luxury to capture my attention.
93	28 30 120 94 195 113 62 104 48 66 93	My pool at home is bigger than that one. Cleaner too.
93	30 87 128 104 203 110 17 116 33 100 93	I once got a picture like but but the duck was closer and it was a very clear shot
93	138 190 126 161 115 95 65 2 150 135 93	I have better arms than her. I have Madonna arms.
93	70 111 102 190 18 184 180 186 159 3 93	My dogs are cuter
93	20 92 89 42 154 99 198 211 29 182 93	get up in this boys went in sports
93	71 177 168 86 169 29 42 5 99 142 93	I would wipe the floor with everyone on that court.
93	211 79 46 177 56 64 27 191 99 165 93	These guys are so smug.
93	39 145 58 78 153 92 32 61 114 173 93	What an ugly hat, mine is better
93	14 179 175 166 91 82 39 145 121 168 93	This doesn't look like a place good enough for me.
93	184 7 153 117 157 175 122 210 50 110 93	My boat is much larger and faster than this guy's boat and I am sure I am better at driving a boat than he is.
93	183 161 56 150 33 168 73 44 75 215 93	I have a whole wall of those trophies
93	117 52 90 22 200 71 3 89 70 166 93	I've made better contrails with my Mazda.
93	21 202 16 138 166 81 89 7 86 88 93	I have that hat. looks better on me.
93	206 160 157 194 200 208 68 61 73 3 93	What is going on ?
93	71 190 44 150 110 6 3 119 162 94 93	I could paint a better portrait.
93	154 86 88 213 10 74 200 113 101 130 93	Step off girly only queens can hold rocks
93	129 162 198 65 82 109 174 94 126 97 93	What in the world are they doing? Maybe they don't have enough to do.
93	114 165 125 149 26 139 1 156 53 102 93	A view from a window
93	31 176 21 129 19 80 186 50 215 1 93	I could make a way better costume than that.
93	147 194 64 86 77 144 52 198 152 116 93	Only two fish?
94	84 212 153 42 202 178 122 158 150 60 94	One of the lights are burned out behind her.
94	169 110 116 16 3 125 46 106 204 141 94	This plane sure does have a lot of wheels.
94	201 36 73 88 90 202 147 207 50 129 94	He has an impressive exoskeleton.
94	111 173 88 81 119 158 3 64 147 204 94	The age range from this group of people appears very drastic.
94	72 157 185 202 26 21 56 87 131 35 94	To view all the items you must watch closely
94	14 128 212 143 148 133 53 175 155 89 94	M,S and a rat. Interesting.
94	213 50 197 80 34 156 40 24 31 115 94	There's a man in that plane
94	4 186 131 197 180 127 138 91 112 140 94	The view is vigilant
94	104 20 31 192 68 134 85 136 18 63 94	If this wasn't in Europe, I'd be afraid that there are no drivers in this bus.
94	95 28 173 197 96 6 111 156 61 126 94	I love the subtle mermaid in the tree. Nice touch.
94	86 109 70 121 160 103 110 165 89 51 94	I find it interesting that they are all paying such close attention to the man who is talking.
94	212 111 116 74 173 85 70 64 129 18 94	The truck is really nice.
94	201 143 10 89 207 41 187 100 96 186 94	That cloud in the lower right looks like a boxing glove.
94	40 19 209 97 50 150 79 201 14 151 94	I see how they intended for the design to be, but this prototype looks flawed.
94	145 177 207 144 8 62 65 105 167 88 94	The child is not Jamaican, but has the flag colors on his hat.
94	171 83 176 113 52 172 208 112 17 22 94	the garbage cans have a lot of writing on them.
94	45 119 159 143 32 90 213 61 164 210 94	Purses tend to be way more expensive than they need to be.
94	173 98 197 35 76 9 63 3 19 123 94	Note the scratches on her shins
94	145 119 190 137 66 126 181 179 101 3 94	The girl is very vigilant
94	154 15 169 147 101 44 148 108 177 187 94	Mindful candle cross
94	152 158 127 170 189 124 199 26 193 113 94	Great view of the clouds right above the buildings.
94	144 33 210 182 148 41 90 58 52 211 94	The plant in the reflection is pretty.
94	54 150 20 190 186 101 17 85 107 168 94	There are exactly 65 yellow-green leaves in this photo.
94	71 139 214 54 91 37 101 115 135 75 94	Looks like a cloudy day.
94	101 34 160 176 114 174 128 5 131 112 94	This is an interesting place to vacation.
94	211 131 201 62 117 92 103 143 33 151 94	The abstract painting appears to have the face of a man on the right of it.
94	56 28 36 3 38 117 83 144 25 109 94	This is a Samurai ceremony. One is the master, and one is the student. They are in traditional Samurai attire.
94	146 33 78 197 160 167 175 37 50 24 94	The france flag is on the front of this journal.
94	176 21 49 157 12 188 122 9 194 108 94	Wow! Look at that! There are some kind of objects in each one of those openings up there expect for one!
94	18 68 17 196 99 208 122 92 80 49 94	I love the details on the roof of that steeple.
94	148 66 15 156 122 31 188 82 161 154 94	I think these kids were from a school group or daycare.
94	37 70 7 172 139 9 200 25 77 13 94	I love viewing the pretty colors of the drums
94	105 136 66 144 35 75 158 83 17 37 94	There is a coin and a shark. I think they are on a boat.
94	43 17 211 60 22 38 30 21 66 122 94	This is kind of neat. I love museums.
94	149 93 57 166 40 144 45 105 207 138 94	This is a great town, very pretty.
94	209 136 159 109 177 57 73 117 153 61 94	the observers are not very interested
94	186 14 70 49 144 156 108 15 52 192 94	Those sandals have really nice thick straps on them
94	34 29 103 150 173 113 66 74 198 137 94	I can't believe this many people gathered for such an unknown cause.  There must be over 200 people.
94	166 172 160 38 9 30 119 44 84 23 94	Oh what a healthy and nutritious meal.
94	191 64 206 145 37 47 158 135 100 58 94	The water is fresh and good for drinking if you're stranded.
94	194 32 205 74 108 167 112 141 65 138 94	The snow covered letters in the middle are really a nice touch!
94	195 85 170 48 178 45 37 43 30 212 94	Those are almond nuts
94	43 117 138 148 178 160 185 34 164 147 94	Saw one of these in a thrift store the other day
94	140 156 17 53 187 5 16 115 68 183 94	This range reminds me of the Ozarks formation
94	68 102 86 85 53 30 33 168 158 64 94	Shes  checking out the others ring to see how much was spent.
94	194 132 138 29 151 85 38 95 134 48 94	Oh, look, that shadow is perfectly covering his backside.
94	25 146 112 151 166 201 141 121 128 99 94	They both appear to be wearing really short skirts although it is cold outside.
94	29 201 197 184 7 122 126 207 150 16 94	Based on the furnishings, it would appear to be a low to mid range restaurant.
94	188 126 86 153 20 201 151 24 203 197 94	A nice day at Island Village, although it looks a little empty.
94	212 28 82 137 48 67 42 204 98 96 94	The perforated panels looks quite interesting over the floral wall.
94	118 24 144 137 189 43 130 207 63 15 94	I love the way the water has shaped the rocks.
94	14 205 26 96 118 92 25 164 195 70 94	The two ladies in the background sure are laughing hard.
94	194 167 52 8 16 109 51 204 12 76 94	This is a wispy cloud in the sky
94	145 157 200 52 175 107 108 64 101 125 94	This artist paints beautiful landscapes
94	140 208 133 29 180 122 23 12 13 116 94	one word. SQUIRREL
94	56 116 25 36 49 190 19 99 162 181 94	Looks like it's going to rain
94	197 192 43 186 88 114 175 35 172 14 94	Well you can't miss someone wearing that color.
94	113 170 91 137 144 152 29 14 58 99 94	Cute dog, very soft fur.
94	210 116 16 76 155 10 193 200 121 13 94	Beautiful landscape image showing trees and buildings
94	161 126 195 87 42 166 117 33 14 54 94	I notice the care with which the mother holds her child.
94	199 16 49 5 30 182 69 197 52 146 94	Look at all of the GAP bags.
94	3 77 204 110 67 132 59 103 139 90 94	The gray of the sky and the gray of the pavement match nearly perfectly.
94	102 38 150 161 143 200 98 24 131 43 94	it is snowing.
94	114 23 197 15 138 144 132 39 165 81 94	that is a nice landscape
94	206 173 3 192 172 139 212 18 44 15 94	It's a baby goat in the woods. It does not appear to notice the photographer.
94	1 12 14 134 209 65 119 164 167 200 94	The Coliseum is behind them and they are just goofing around.
94	6 214 71 107 190 146 198 50 187 202 94	These dandelions have numerous wishes.
94	167 103 10 31 39 101 204 191 180 95 94	They will get tired after the eighth mile.
94	95 206 4 67 138 76 91 2 58 22 94	There are 450 steps to the end.
94	193 145 4 137 182 174 200 203 121 194 94	Blue like the official flag of Sheldon and Leonard's apartment.
94	45 98 155 28 154 153 55 144 186 83 94	Oh the lights are so bright!
94	48 84 141 125 90 174 196 160 178 25 94	That is a very old van.
94	129 150 13 16 22 115 106 74 26 200 94	The gate matches the trim on the house.
94	60 8 163 150 167 30 136 118 14 55 94	This tree is blocking my view of the sun.
94	209 40 140 33 31 114 25 215 5 185 94	Look at the lighting effects.
94	116 118 45 102 79 75 164 119 70 78 94	They man in the back has an 86 jersey and belongs to the other team.
94	38 206 166 62 101 74 180 203 151 213 94	You can tell by the plant colorations that it has been a really dry season.
94	195 16 151 42 179 163 3 128 117 104 94	There are fifteen people, including the referree
94	205 171 157 199 59 38 58 10 182 206 94	That bridge looks very steep but pretty stable.
94	176 162 46 185 123 198 194 133 22 38 94	I love how the shadow of the tree highlights different parts of the duck's faces
94	128 108 152 181 111 178 13 107 126 167 94	attention to detail
94	163 40 66 49 212 103 128 10 121 99 94	The bark on that tree looks like oak, and the leaves are not poison ivy, so they're safe to touch.
94	181 209 53 30 101 26 16 189 54 113 94	Not a real person in the photo
94	188 63 108 114 26 100 212 2 12 5 94	He looks like he is coming out of nowhere.
94	67 132 160 72 153 18 147 199 155 83 94	He either meant to to say Geez or Cheese here.
94	214 175 140 184 174 171 25 23 128 183 94	You really should be wearing safety glasses when you work under a car
94	137 93 41 31 167 162 11 116 195 117 94	The colors in this image really offset each other to make this scene of a sleeping boy interestingly dynamic.
94	30 65 58 34 187 210 145 78 176 146 94	He isn't looking at the man shaking his hand.
94	73 119 183 50 131 66 212 113 40 2 94	Had a bit much to drink?
94	191 54 143 197 5 74 156 39 67 111 94	I see a man in a yellow jacket.
94	38 34 95 67 63 136 160 84 213 205 94	I think it might be christmas there.
94	6 3 122 5 69 113 178 166 119 1 94	I love that dish soap.
94	172 151 18 106 83 134 44 61 68 7 94	The kid with the red hair really has a crazy look in his face.
94	23 131 151 114 24 142 122 149 208 58 94	I see lots of greenery.
94	93 121 44 88 207 87 206 41 59 136 94	This baby panda looks quite clean, the zoo must have bathed it for the photo shoot.
94	90 82 111 4 74 86 131 16 7 61 94	the shadow from the red card takes up the whole next lane
94	87 42 213 169 183 38 164 85 65 99 94	I think this is a check point in our hike.
94	139 55 114 64 56 105 111 213 149 198 94	Those are some very thick thorns on the cactus.
94	156 86 89 88 210 111 129 83 81 131 94	It is clear that whoever took this photo was either jumping or far taller than the subject.
94	142 62 10 122 26 153 85 7 39 23 94	This is a colorful door.
94	195 73 204 4 23 207 58 15 133 144 94	Probably a barn, i just dont know why in black&white
94	198 130 57 152 63 22 13 56 214 199 94	The girls are most likely playing soccer.
94	75 168 68 3 73 56 21 4 144 119 94	Ah, roman numerals and zodiac signs.
94	100 121 63 125 184 187 124 60 205 101 94	He's walking towards the pier in the distance perhaps?
94	137 87 38 105 90 93 95 101 182 213 94	I can see another island back there.
94	2 96 27 89 100 153 65 47 158 184 94	This is a performance of the band Trapt.
94	197 175 152 129 158 47 61 151 166 111 94	Everyone on this team seems happy.
94	202 72 43 67 47 93 54 62 24 145 94	Whom ever cut the square in the ceiling, I do not think it is straight.
94	138 133 149 191 7 39 81 170 129 190 94	If you miss this exit, you'll miss the train.
94	110 134 97 140 74 25 156 120 182 197 94	They coordinated their sun glasses, shirts, and leg tattoos. How cute!
94	161 178 188 134 153 65 68 135 100 207 94	The brickwork on this building is stunning. Just look at all the detail!
94	197 171 193 42 120 10 9 183 13 59 94	Is that a car or a bus on the right?
94	201 170 187 83 16 131 107 128 11 102 94	That looks really hot.
94	190 21 18 188 37 192 33 155 76 41 94	The pants he is wearing are blue jeans
94	76 196 122 17 24 18 184 79 185 211 94	The way the streetlight illuminates the leaves is beautiful.
94	46 115 203 179 192 184 32 174 66 67 94	Looks like a very complicated design that took a lot of work
94	180 120 175 113 147 79 90 92 173 26 94	This party is getting crowded.
94	215 127 14 160 200 148 114 97 55 204 94	What a beautiful place to live.
94	128 109 62 51 82 193 71 120 145 67 94	There is not enough room for that boat.
94	70 141 184 51 53 5 152 8 171 48 94	What a beautiful view
94	49 86 162 116 53 111 78 196 67 8 94	There are five visible hearts on the front of this cake
94	138 29 214 140 183 103 27 42 47 151 94	There are so many houses.
94	169 43 104 55 57 162 92 102 95 198 94	Sky above the sea, probably a sunset happening
94	5 135 172 60 25 57 198 148 159 116 94	Two people are wearing black while one is sporting white.
94	56 10 68 194 204 95 203 160 96 50 94	Kids from the beginning will learning about the surrounding very fast.
94	70 115 202 98 26 87 130 150 14 214 94	His shirt has no sleeves.
94	87 18 105 116 123 29 164 166 215 78 94	These are cans, the type without pull tabs.
94	26 121 38 24 46 72 215 157 65 196 94	He's throwing that ball pretty well.
94	61 192 25 127 18 86 161 158 183 150 94	The guy in the back is wearing high white socks! That's a big no-no.
94	191 131 60 34 51 87 92 7 4 86 94	She's got good posture
94	60 131 53 102 133 159 177 23 174 72 94	Is that a mouse on a human body?
94	213 24 105 168 111 16 119 212 194 70 94	This picture is over 10 years old now!
94	37 12 111 125 112 209 6 83 141 145 94	Karaoke! My favorite past time!
94	126 75 201 45 40 192 114 179 55 131 94	Wow! The microwave oven makes this photo so much more artistic!
94	180 67 205 40 152 119 13 214 120 14 94	Are those porcupine quills sticking out of those shorts?
94	14 208 78 92 151 158 55 161 70 142 94	This is a very feminine color.
94	60 115 11 98 33 40 122 83 131 111 94	Look the way she intricately works on this task, with her bare hands. So much precision.
94	7 20 26 18 178 11 51 99 117 17 94	Isn't he surfing a little to close to shore?
94	178 53 83 101 129 65 197 37 203 125 94	The picture showing the growth of the city
94	174 38 63 143 197 24 195 129 175 113 94	I can tell that is only one guy and two women.
94	174 179 58 92 160 154 153 121 63 12 94	You can tell that they all have a gummy worm in their mouths.
94	137 200 30 2 178 132 82 41 136 9 94	The guy is right next to a road, because it goes from brick to concrete.
94	185 41 182 150 72 180 65 76 141 114 94	The ocean seems endless until you get to the other side.
94	60 74 72 127 9 57 16 193 41 111 94	Opulent luxury amidst marble, crystal and bronze.
94	63 23 6 184 82 170 51 181 112 109 94	These birds look weak and starved. They surely need something to eat.
94	213 81 109 171 43 202 29 210 3 22 94	With the gate and the large building at the end of the path, it appears that that's a pretty important place.
94	103 35 187 24 59 146 194 171 4 109 94	The clouds hang ever so gentle over the mountains edge.
94	29 77 117 68 205 30 47 201 27 167 94	They're queuing up to get tickets to go into the museum. The man at the front might be signing a petition.
94	190 127 35 15 85 186 134 128 168 61 94	I really should talk to the neighbors about that roof.
94	60 113 28 170 101 59 131 6 30 71 94	This is a very interesting image. It is bright, colourful and of an interesting artistic design. I notice the lady (assuming it is a lady, as the person is wearing female clothing) has a particular stance, and is located in close proximity to an umbrella. The way that the umbrella is already extended possibly indicated the woman recently used it, and discarded it. I would like to know more about this, to see if it is the case.
94	43 79 131 193 90 130 114 200 96 16 94	That hen has brown eyes
94	38 97 5 159 137 203 47 172 114 117 94	he uses alot of hair gel
94	16 91 129 73 23 68 160 9 145 212 94	This furniture does not match.
94	8 169 13 4 114 79 93 165 97 212 94	The horse has extended and elongated his body in order to jump the hurdle.
94	90 155 34 45 125 73 214 48 88 23 94	They are swimming.
94	121 37 40 129 184 42 189 116 215 89 94	dude in the boat is a bit overprepared considering the state the boats in rn
94	177 173 47 181 78 105 190 43 8 114 94	Closer look at this puts me off
94	163 82 191 45 35 122 74 162 129 198 94	A shed can always be handy as a storage room.
94	189 156 74 98 44 110 190 46 79 129 94	Not enough winds for raising sails.
94	172 36 102 84 119 69 99 207 98 158 94	That path has been worn in by thousands of people before you and will be continued by thousands after.
94	48 88 199 130 176 101 46 58 155 22 94	The man in the back is the only one with a green shirt.
94	144 145 212 118 174 115 182 178 137 117 94	Women always give a smile with their teeth open.
94	170 136 11 185 130 181 190 101 165 121 94	Church service is going to start
94	181 187 23 154 146 65 78 51 26 202 94	The green grass is bright until you get to the tree line where the brown grass seems to hold the shadows.
94	32 203 101 80 84 138 83 11 134 184 94	They left grandma behind.
94	174 175 171 37 91 141 190 124 180 56 94	she has two buns
94	10 7 89 146 171 186 140 21 130 13 94	It's so muddy in the hogs home
94	122 90 145 118 214 9 10 73 125 18 94	They seem to be getting served.
94	72 139 123 95 7 171 17 213 106 21 94	This gentleman needs to shave.
94	139 68 16 112 11 153 168 187 19 124 94	I notice that her pants are quite low!
94	122 147 55 193 79 214 38 198 98 80 94	I see no one else is even near him. He won big time
94	212 100 204 143 162 90 189 132 176 27 94	Why are the tree trunks white at the bottom?
94	59 149 123 154 184 8 215 213 112 110 94	Can you see that the tree in the distant background needs trimming?
94	56 143 112 177 34 147 161 88 79 209 94	The rocks are uniquely formed. The dry weather plays a big part.
94	33 158 132 62 81 75 82 130 117 32 94	Those prongs look like some kind of a plastic scrubby brush or those noppy sandals.
94	93 192 184 146 36 32 108 214 103 162 94	She's dancing in heels?!?!
94	154 108 137 156 53 3 186 166 132 128 94	He only sleeps like this on his favorite green blanket.
94	192 83 52 118 73 140 197 10 8 182 94	The yellow trim on the uniform is a nice contrast.
94	210 211 28 81 65 163 89 192 38 64 94	This looks like it's in Europe
94	68 176 148 198 210 15 59 93 65 80 94	The lake is very calm and the people are all in a row.
94	175 87 37 125 149 38 145 53 123 197 94	Hmm... I think number 32 over there probably should've gotten a penalty for grabbing.
94	182 69 7 28 26 27 103 202 75 48 94	How succinctly those skyscrapers are lifted in the middle of this city
94	60 36 188 162 7 17 197 68 92 74 94	When the sunset is blocked by so many power poles and lines, well maybe that is a clue that we should be switching to solar energy and getting our beautiful views back.
94	51 152 55 137 148 210 35 126 75 139 94	There are so many windows on all of these buildings.
94	129 97 181 173 78 112 163 42 155 174 94	I think they are Adidas Samba trainers.
94	95 30 150 174 118 154 8 60 40 129 94	The ball will touch the sky
94	103 108 35 184 110 97 118 9 133 137 94	Painting looks faded.
94	27 23 177 150 79 151 195 199 28 206 94	The fireworks burst was like some kind of neon dandelion that released smoke like pollen in the wind.
94	14 172 59 56 136 140 39 86 198 199 94	I notice he's holding a book for dummies in his hand. What's that say about him?
94	163 108 18 51 204 14 142 73 109 103 94	some sort of animal?
95	49 120 72 138 80 161 211 156 111 182 95	The dog is about to attack.
95	46 175 63 192 187 59 104 112 195 151 95	I wonder what kind of pranks I could pull here.
95	191 181 2 64 204 208 190 26 84 8 95	Now I am going to sneak over this red line while the humans aren't looking.
95	162 51 101 88 204 34 112 136 215 49 95	I wonder where i can find this....
95	144 87 212 198 25 173 116 188 107 48 95	I should have tied her shoes together before she started riding.
95	123 55 17 80 22 204 155 23 206 183 95	Watch out little boat!
95	215 63 196 76 122 110 45 78 79 41 95	This is so bright. It gets me all excited.
95	190 143 166 94 144 108 62 6 126 169 95	thats a good smash
95	174 88 44 81 124 182 194 189 167 186 95	fraudulent, sneaky, wily
95	45 68 46 14 213 155 20 177 78 122 95	I will find a way to steal that sign so someone enters the area and gets in trouble.
95	112 96 160 45 206 115 32 22 132 79 95	Some of these ducklings are acting deceitful by not sharing their food
95	168 125 126 167 94 73 89 17 39 189 95	I saw this man alone in the woods at night.  I felt a scary presence with me the moment before I saw him then he disappeared.
95	144 99 79 61 9 49 91 7 119 102 95	I bet if we jumped on the tree it would fall over
95	27 2 189 72 28 203 86 68 82 6 95	Wouldn't it be fun to waterski this?
95	86 94 51 4 129 52 35 140 1 113 95	This would totally fall during an earthquake.
95	197 96 85 212 163 51 156 198 116 158 95	This really is the entrance to a underground villa, do not be fooled.
95	38 184 1 213 199 210 179 40 109 12 95	This dog should move.
95	125 35 63 31 100 68 202 28 36 43 95	A little child-like play does us good now and then.
95	114 93 6 68 133 204 151 147 5 64 95	This color  makes me feel hyper.
95	45 69 159 65 184 128 85 177 89 27 95	I could probably distract those airline pilots with a drone.
95	119 131 42 203 12 164 90 212 176 46 95	I think I would be able to pull a wig over these peoples eyes.  They seem very gullible.
95	82 120 183 53 134 72 79 73 140 131 95	These guys are up to no good, and I want IN!
95	112 67 139 190 129 42 98 92 141 7 95	This prison needs some barbed wire.
95	86 134 136 31 138 105 27 9 118 39 95	Beautiful, but dangerous because it's a city.
95	190 29 133 57 214 205 164 102 58 107 95	Each line is actually an eye lid with lashes. Imagine if they all opened at once.
95	22 176 214 144 187 96 111 69 132 195 95	I secretly sent my parents to hang out aat a bingo convention so I could throw the most insane party of the 21st century!
95	192 165 9 34 36 104 212 193 85 70 95	I hope these whales get caught, i want some of their blubber!
95	152 67 83 13 189 168 8 36 153 169 95	What are we celebrating here? Pour me a glass!
95	121 30 82 100 167 98 70 132 142 96 95	I wonder if I could climb one of those pillars.
95	209 92 153 40 172 77 193 214 118 33 95	Whoever's driving should get out and get wet in the storm.
95	184 67 56 106 121 122 185 124 55 132 95	People always gather when something is happening, but most people are like sheep and if a handful of people are interested then everyone else will follow without knowing why.
95	215 199 10 61 97 178 99 71 35 117 95	This doesn't make much sense, throw it out.
95	22 70 197 118 175 125 26 85 145 19 95	Having fun with my kids
95	91 62 177 156 142 113 117 123 197 172 95	I want you to sell me that camera.  You are going to sell me that camera.
95	68 213 43 93 107 83 61 51 59 146 95	The place is dull
95	207 11 129 148 70 196 201 31 112 46 95	where is this at?
95	45 164 202 59 10 184 101 86 28 39 95	that guy will rob them
95	113 162 161 213 156 26 49 110 51 215 95	I would never achieve this skill unless I managed to find a way to photoshop myself doing this!
95	179 31 145 182 123 81 139 15 72 113 95	It's amazing Mcdonalds is still allowed to serve people with the quality of food coming out of the kitchem
95	56 25 44 147 65 34 59 168 18 211 95	Everyone looks dusty and dehydrated. Must've been camping all day for their music festival.
95	166 100 182 96 67 19 24 94 46 108 95	Wouldn't it be great if Lax players fought like the do in hockey. Someone might end up dead though with all of those metal poles.
95	59 41 33 146 58 164 100 43 191 107 95	Whoever drew this really has it coming this is nightmare fuel.
95	168 170 102 69 120 36 200 178 110 123 95	I'll shine that guys head for a nickle.
95	180 135 58 81 90 193 16 74 176 78 95	People should be arrested for not printing these in English or not teaching me spanish.
95	14 37 41 160 108 70 128 21 59 87 95	Super easy to scare the person with you...just say the bar is loose.
95	13 1 93 125 155 107 54 38 47 196 95	This sweet little girl looks like she is up to something
95	6 67 193 126 125 127 74 51 59 2 95	Which room to choose
95	83 213 122 26 210 150 50 18 190 215 95	I hope this is going to drop a missle on some terrorists
95	212 45 29 133 38 49 178 83 1 126 95	The planes are going to crash!
95	27 202 82 64 88 209 176 59 22 184 95	I wonder if I could park here without getting a parking ticket.
95	40 58 12 201 46 79 131 203 127 77 95	Think I can steal that statue?
95	45 52 71 58 89 61 105 93 175 144 95	I really want to jump into that water and swim around!
95	136 184 51 18 4 79 42 126 195 78 95	I wonder what I can get into today.
95	110 200 86 139 29 150 153 104 149 160 95	All those paramedics and cops, something must be going on - and it's not over!
95	131 92 107 178 210 151 38 196 100 147 95	These places, with their lack of security and cameras, would be a perfect place to burglarize.
95	156 155 133 115 9 44 42 37 208 135 95	I hope he hurts himself sliding
95	33 195 27 182 212 25 136 1 157 70 95	whats right off the side of the stage that has them worried? possibly a demon?
95	75 51 33 20 5 40 210 4 19 13 95	i would smash that statue
95	133 28 84 174 41 180 109 150 29 5 95	Lets make a domino effect and make these bikes fall down
95	78 183 158 75 124 59 30 21 184 55 95	If I throw something on the field they may miss catching the football.
95	13 175 161 69 4 71 138 28 21 213 95	The hope the battery in that clock dies.
95	19 100 91 185 99 84 89 39 184 92 95	Her smile tells me she is up to no good
95	114 193 204 131 151 175 123 110 144 106 95	I could hide these tools and see how long it takes for someone to find them.
95	5 179 88 117 139 183 14 65 215 169 95	I wonder if I could smoke in the plane now since everyone is distracted .
95	112 144 137 111 114 161 57 36 40 203 95	I wonder what trouble I could get into here.
95	162 173 177 127 200 1 22 20 120 62 95	If I kick over these paint can no one will know it was me.
95	98 66 103 188 77 153 202 143 162 109 95	I wonder what these two have been up to.
95	28 192 212 51 132 54 105 143 115 82 95	The photos on there are very revealing.
95	147 94 199 211 150 90 56 143 41 132 95	This cat is so sweet I'm going to take it home with me.
95	101 117 21 122 17 132 143 47 34 100 95	This would be the easiest way to sneak into someone's house and steal their stuff.
95	43 36 112 63 202 8 73 44 131 64 95	I would take this plant to feed my family and no one would ever find out!
95	56 184 8 11 200 131 160 60 72 31 95	For fun, I'd pull the hat down over the little fellows eyes! LOL
95	65 202 43 204 62 14 116 58 47 125 95	I wonder what would happen if someone took the guardrails off.
95	211 72 92 30 23 78 189 138 14 193 95	Now, what if I ran up behind these guys and startled them? Would they all fall off into the water?
95	114 101 13 70 177 194 81 188 52 109 95	How to exercise AND watch your construction site.
95	213 7 178 114 77 189 204 115 63 153 95	Those wine bottles would be easy to pop open every night if one felt like doing such.
95	173 57 11 50 99 110 113 157 148 35 95	Little did the guest know that they would be sitting with their dreaded enemy.
95	79 183 66 23 72 144 214 33 25 140 95	What could this dog be into?
95	129 37 28 180 203 152 14 100 128 99 95	This would be the perfect opportunity to dunk this man in the water.
95	192 163 41 56 202 97 90 25 17 155 95	Wow look at that bee! They are much smarter than people. I wish I had a stinger and could make honey.
95	120 39 136 106 178 128 101 20 179 153 95	This photo has a very dark, brooding tone.
95	196 75 24 30 47 21 138 132 172 94 95	I really like that jacket, I might steal it!
95	213 202 163 215 87 133 125 47 110 176 95	really, i don't think so. am under the influence.
95	90 15 98 188 120 156 141 101 189 128 95	It a good idea to celebrate a birthday with loved ones and friends.
95	9 147 184 71 24 6 188 85 49 155 95	Theres nothing special about whats inside the cage.
95	26 13 144 165 175 191 18 3 140 182 95	I could sneak over and pick his pocket, he's just a typical tourist.
95	69 24 177 93 91 54 188 118 189 211 95	I wonder what would happen if I started cutting those wires...
95	204 127 58 176 24 78 208 110 81 86 95	Ok, I have a few thoughts about this, but I won't say them out loud.
95	62 109 64 124 90 5 174 144 118 194 95	Sneaking around, taking pictures of unaware people in the street. Doesn't seem so innocent.
95	167 179 96 82 74 34 11 65 6 213 95	Those birds are so unaware of the damage I could inflict upon them.
95	70 136 104 135 55 201 178 198 108 182 95	Hard to hit that not just right, isn't it?
95	159 7 139 91 193 215 17 166 46 196 95	Ah a great machine that can fly and I cna destory my enemies with!
95	166 57 55 206 88 86 81 10 13 105 95	If you keep watching they are about to drop the painting on top of him.
95	130 190 208 82 33 167 23 31 61 40 95	I want to tear down that sign.
95	1 202 130 10 153 60 22 82 141 118 95	Sometimes unethical activities leads to poor life, a true fact!
95	68 107 110 45 106 165 93 41 123 6 95	Its hell lot of thinking about nature, trees and new plants! i want to live for myself first!
95	11 168 96 73 191 21 59 172 87 3 95	Are any of those bikes unlocked?
95	195 140 152 174 84 121 115 136 3 131 95	Ah, yes. I hope you all enjoy this beautiful picture i decided to take on my vacation in Hawaii, isn't it gorgeous?
95	45 48 87 77 52 184 173 190 129 20 95	It looks like he noticed what I left for him there in the pool
95	29 39 62 106 46 97 11 188 15 87 95	For me red color indicates an unfair color!
95	156 82 139 81 135 155 53 107 110 137 95	As long as a I can get through this contraption I can finally find where Jerry is hiding his money! It shall soon be mine!
95	48 209 132 5 156 197 8 151 183 127 95	I want to destroy that!
95	80 50 187 141 143 175 196 139 74 193 95	Looks like the car of a cheating ex, except this one still has non-slit tires!
95	39 127 64 111 9 48 93 205 106 88 95	That cat in the middle is trouble. I can tell.
95	128 60 149 37 99 17 185 36 130 148 95	If we pull the hand away, the tree will fall.
95	212 60 139 85 135 84 53 43 174 116 95	I wonder what that little dog is up to. Its a dark overcast day and I think he is up to something.
95	114 97 8 125 171 90 81 190 178 176 95	Look how huge that knife is!
95	157 145 187 3 159 67 147 17 178 151 95	This baby will be separated from her mother once she gets to the border.
95	214 80 208 117 77 68 23 164 183 107 95	The guy on the left looks like he is going to be beat by the bigger guy on the right1
95	177 34 100 131 146 36 188 117 84 151 95	I wonder what would happen if I didn't follow the laws?
95	99 44 85 128 162 108 60 32 72 23 95	I wonder how many people I could trip there.
95	57 106 69 115 101 2 183 167 49 186 95	I bet he gets in trouble.
95	124 189 201 196 185 61 212 21 103 123 95	It would be easy to steal that dish.
95	35 28 93 189 43 158 161 68 175 9 95	We have plans, evil plans.
95	85 196 126 31 12 123 84 6 35 24 95	I have a bridge to sell you.
95	108 29 83 126 13 6 144 51 65 131 95	I want to push someone down those stairs.
95	184 164 136 14 23 31 88 48 168 112 95	Id set fire to that room.
95	137 163 156 179 29 212 123 76 96 180 95	What even is this? Whatever it is, it looks awful.
95	9 39 102 49 43 13 38 66 160 207 95	Just wait till you see the surprise in that bath bomb
95	77 86 181 80 155 39 1 206 54 18 95	Hmm I wonder what kind of things you could hide in a forest such as this.
95	59 83 14 115 172 53 110 139 147 50 95	We could start an avalanche.
95	173 84 141 205 32 151 44 215 61 58 95	Just wait this parade won't be going on much longer.
95	15 41 157 54 189 159 96 207 170 169 95	This poor flower looks like it's dying
95	211 43 149 167 20 68 74 26 166 190 95	This boat is about to pick up illegal immigrants.
95	3 54 119 57 49 183 132 62 112 200 95	Hi mom! hahahha not really.
95	62 215 186 75 78 191 163 171 89 116 95	He's gonna trip and fall
95	15 183 181 211 82 143 86 112 109 137 95	Fancy restaurants charge so much for a small plate of food like that and people go for it. It's genius
95	128 19 29 34 193 22 178 96 55 99 95	Be fun to push someone into the water
95	166 121 57 32 2 123 21 107 190 174 95	Ho ho, this picture makes me want to start a FOOD FIGHT!
95	8 108 121 27 193 76 60 26 59 72 95	Let's give her the costume jewelry and she would believe it is gold in exchange for her boat.
95	134 144 26 63 85 93 9 71 12 165 95	He looks like he's plotting some sinister plan and scoping out his place to carry it out.
95	72 76 13 105 5 90 15 10 109 62 95	It looks like that anchor needs a new home.
95	132 168 22 191 78 192 184 53 171 162 95	I will do everything in my power to put this place out of business.
95	113 71 185 89 160 151 23 3 163 80 95	I would like to pull that tragic purple tie over his badge as a nuisance
95	51 78 123 208 76 137 189 85 113 56 95	I'm not sure, but that resembles an undressed lady.
95	74 12 147 128 110 210 53 198 75 137 95	You wish your knew what l was doing
95	170 21 91 45 167 110 172 178 103 28 95	I wonder what sort of valuables they have in there?
95	12 176 86 145 146 72 54 136 61 191 95	I bet that cat has seen some things.
95	58 20 59 80 109 193 1 94 89 33 95	I want to learn how to do that!
95	11 151 62 161 143 83 153 86 167 213 95	It would be so simple to round up these people and take them to a camp.
95	19 159 8 7 29 201 21 115 162 32 95	I imagined how many could be deceived to go into this dark place.
95	43 20 40 63 10 93 56 35 108 140 95	I hope he wins the fight and the other people lose, because they are dumb.
95	132 198 171 181 169 85 50 145 112 43 95	I wonder what this could taste like?
95	142 24 185 25 44 64 38 125 194 126 95	Imagine if you started eating a smelly egg sandwich in the middle of that crowd.
95	54 65 146 15 172 126 109 4 205 174 95	I know that the flower in the picture looks orange due to the light but actually it's pink.
95	152 5 118 120 200 137 212 156 101 21 95	jsut hid that phone under the table. how long would it take to find again?
95	36 75 177 47 58 145 169 37 35 172 95	if they are trying to get a message across, it doesn't work
95	109 57 63 52 17 69 31 100 91 87 95	I bet I could break into that place
95	86 182 159 89 93 61 84 109 117 171 95	I want to stomp on that!
95	143 1 118 71 63 25 179 39 33 148 95	Feet height will succeed
95	121 63 60 43 111 120 81 58 162 65 95	They are not a normal family, but a family of villains who run a secret crime ring out of their pizza joint.
95	125 194 96 208 114 77 185 148 186 169 95	I'm gonna wait til someone else pays the bill.
95	73 102 120 134 178 182 192 172 169 35 95	This looks skeptic to me, away with it!
95	39 110 140 156 170 126 168 47 129 1 95	That rhino should be destroyed!
95	47 79 204 36 72 213 86 205 56 193 95	I wonder if she's about to push her friend in the water.
95	182 152 112 73 110 193 42 173 151 85 95	I want to steal his instrument.
95	171 165 124 32 5 179 86 196 209 89 95	The people in this picture look miserable.
95	134 62 77 65 160 120 26 92 24 12 95	Why are playing alone...?
95	118 53 99 105 15 85 187 76 59 177 95	He does not even goto school here
95	191 145 192 40 76 39 190 127 47 81 95	I could hide in those bushes and wait to jump out and scare someone.
95	136 175 31 212 36 62 118 200 12 16 95	i put hot pepper in the salad they aren't tomatoes
95	101 160 97 211 174 136 123 151 79 73 95	They hate each other
95	124 4 34 131 70 144 15 186 3 169 95	This is too high
95	185 48 58 151 89 157 73 215 30 15 95	I bet they are driving while taking that picture.
95	51 104 63 138 113 129 2 52 84 64 95	I would make love with any woman on that fence.
95	41 16 20 203 11 169 47 40 112 106 95	The sand devils might be out if the wind picks up,
95	4 157 26 181 97 52 139 74 110 209 95	I bet she'd be easy to knock over since she's distracted.
95	143 116 172 18 148 5 84 208 183 184 95	this is very educational task you complete
95	6 66 92 162 159 130 200 89 117 54 95	I'd blow his candles out first.
95	120 97 8 96 102 212 89 193 69 72 95	There are tons of things to throw off that tall building that would be so much fun.
95	71 122 72 137 140 208 18 1 5 178 95	Hmmmm looks like no one is paying attention at the moment...
95	82 145 142 10 32 215 43 50 154 62 95	Let's get the window dirty since mom just cleaned it.
95	210 21 121 201 16 134 83 196 146 54 95	I'm glad I moved these people away from the rest of the crowd.
95	124 206 37 157 109 30 4 153 151 197 95	I'd smash that guitar
95	38 23 210 3 202 186 135 149 90 44 95	I wish I had access to all of those boats! A little hot wiring, and I would be sailing the open seas!
95	131 112 132 44 82 138 75 191 33 77 95	The anaconda lunges from the quiet water.
95	195 12 56 158 142 89 41 67 117 127 95	you can do it....
95	178 203 61 193 112 29 70 188 101 182 95	This is the exact same block 60 years later
95	61 161 146 207 30 44 94 159 160 191 95	She is probably thinking of ultimate ways of achieving much desired success
95	7 96 147 194 193 121 166 127 72 187 95	Those berries sure look yummy. It'd be a shame if somebody stole them ...
95	117 98 136 68 118 147 178 23 176 197 95	A town like this probably leaves their doors unlocked, perfect for picking up precious items when no one is around.
95	114 1 140 13 100 151 52 199 115 81 95	The photographer should use unflattering angles. You know, just because it's fun ...
95	194 60 212 147 165 168 35 191 210 198 95	This would be good for playing pranks.
95	72 87 130 29 115 180 30 122 106 59 95	We told everyone it took us 5 days to climb the mountain, when it actually took us 8...
95	98 127 7 1 42 186 121 157 87 156 95	That guy sitting there could totally grab some extra freebies right now.
95	91 39 77 64 44 89 25 213 171 211 95	What a wonderful plant, it could even be used as a weapon
95	44 70 112 84 126 54 72 79 180 121 95	Well he did something wrong
95	208 97 128 137 36 91 106 30 29 191 95	I could throw a stick between those spokes.
96	1 116 196 69 176 7 104 19 156 161 96	Stunning, beautiful place.
96	117 9 10 111 84 23 22 119 26 156 96	This reminds me of your cute face...
96	142 9 190 2 131 112 140 49 25 150 96	This photo reminds me of my German escapades. Many romps and roundabout run-ins, all serving to bring me closer to my true self.
96	38 123 137 46 114 141 187 180 129 171 96	I wonder how many love stories have taken place here?
96	85 208 161 14 87 182 98 190 4 94 96	I Llove dining here.
96	186 111 48 16 163 202 214 141 121 171 96	this teal-colored tile is very evocative. Makes me think of seascapes, underwater vistas, crab people even.
96	72 28 71 162 109 19 12 136 115 2 96	Holding hands in the rain is very loving
96	173 168 144 19 203 193 118 174 126 111 96	This could be a lovely getaway with my significant other!
96	100 172 18 61 97 213 93 126 101 49 96	What a dream to see your favorite band live!
96	39 145 68 97 31 174 84 37 214 58 96	These old buildings look like the ones set in romance movies, I must take my husband there immediately.
96	139 63 102 50 136 176 60 4 67 142 96	The woman is in love
96	7 86 103 21 163 170 129 179 175 25 96	I hope this is a bed and breakfast I can use for a getaway.
96	141 152 91 95 211 25 34 19 1 41 96	I love my dog, and my partner who always makes sure to take care of him
96	80 69 52 192 129 151 14 207 6 102 96	I would give this beautiful flower to the love of my life.
96	172 32 1 95 186 86 64 171 67 63 96	I'd love to lay in a beautiful field with my significant other.
96	146 86 47 123 194 36 55 153 87 207 96	I would love to gaze at this scenery with a lover.
96	118 99 7 156 202 148 180 183 1 93 96	"Ive got all of the kisses!"
96	2 204 36 139 61 83 53 146 98 127 96	I would love to ride this bike with my arms wrapped around the waist of the woman I love.
96	113 151 215 161 30 208 183 194 199 34 96	Birds lovely stare.
96	187 165 113 149 49 8 12 151 110 161 96	Although the act may be gruesome, the staging and tone of the color is beautiful in its own way.
96	33 152 7 36 107 43 58 53 90 200 96	Isn't it wonderful how beautiful couples make such beautiful children?
96	193 60 57 77 36 176 10 3 136 39 96	The glassed in shower is great for steamy nights
96	165 180 16 34 50 131 198 33 93 188 96	our next vacation
96	98 74 205 105 180 112 128 56 154 95 96	How wonderful and lovely.
96	176 100 135 104 195 151 148 103 160 122 96	This man is the love of my lfie
96	110 206 86 94 193 44 196 171 138 185 96	This looks like the ideal spot for a grand adventure. A mountain trek, perhaps ending at the home of a peak-dwelling sage.
96	66 111 46 153 5 112 194 69 17 143 96	That sand.... They aren't thinking of demolishing that old beautiful building, are they? Would be most wasteful of history.
96	46 109 147 63 10 30 82 141 92 122 96	These men look ready for a grand adventure.
96	200 163 78 30 135 215 26 41 154 180 96	This is a lovely flower for a first date gift.
96	86 118 107 157 79 143 112 22 65 195 96	What a lovely fountain
96	60 135 146 113 176 109 17 195 213 122 96	I love you but this is not fun!
96	71 16 24 21 208 7 79 30 126 29 96	Look at you hunny, I think I need anpther shower.
96	147 63 82 31 199 107 176 104 164 75 96	Oh i'd love to go on a date here.
96	52 58 67 12 112 131 171 117 66 45 96	What a nice night for a stroll.
96	150 214 148 151 38 178 97 20 21 111 96	I can be romantic but she is beautiful
96	132 135 195 188 40 142 83 212 65 5 96	She looks so beautiful in that dress I want to date her.
96	29 182 154 32 66 148 58 191 54 162 96	A family picture
96	70 90 35 99 25 24 112 51 150 94 96	There is no feeling like overlooking the city with a person you love.
96	124 19 80 123 88 193 211 9 83 105 96	Love at first sight.
96	124 186 114 42 127 62 18 6 159 80 96	Two peas in a pod.
96	93 201 49 81 164 129 204 171 194 202 96	Nothing like love like being on a wonderful boat ride
96	37 14 41 15 78 176 146 186 212 160 96	The kittens are cuddling with one another
96	167 10 141 59 198 50 186 197 75 9 96	The view looks relaxing and nice
96	74 161 182 97 196 33 20 183 58 168 96	Oh man! I wish this was me and my man on the ocean with the sweet, salty ocean breeze and sound of waves. <3
96	52 208 137 166 9 79 117 175 15 149 96	The view is so beautiful
96	84 95 19 207 8 87 14 61 204 143 96	It was a beautiful experience seeing the play with my wife.
96	136 106 212 137 162 74 29 116 47 26 96	My girlfriend just loves it when I buy her sample tea packets.
96	86 92 1 185 73 74 38 67 90 58 96	Some people call me tacky, but I love long walks on the beach.
96	28 165 196 29 90 13 3 5 111 12 96	Forsooth! Foul knave, point thy broomstick away from our Hero's visage! He hath escaped his circle of protection, and I fear for his safety!
96	44 78 135 187 213 201 114 118 165 178 96	Love spending time outdoors with this hubby of mine.
96	1 48 56 186 192 55 40 72 69 100 96	I would love to to go for a picnic with my partner to see that elephant at the park
96	201 55 199 22 42 104 184 3 136 62 96	You never know where's you'll fine love, maybe sometime it's on the subway while eating an apple.
96	11 186 167 158 57 43 65 159 67 98 96	I would love to gaze at the stars from a top a high platform such as this.
96	18 68 71 6 39 12 193 197 53 25 96	My partner today is very beautiful.
96	89 182 213 188 120 166 67 1 10 43 96	I once gave this doll to my wife for her birthday.
96	146 57 148 190 4 151 14 175 83 108 96	Wow, what a beautiful place to visit. How inspirational.
96	104 6 62 145 165 94 118 167 129 27 96	That's a cute date, for a couple that bikes together. There's even a little picnic towel!
96	192 133 186 115 69 200 163 12 35 84 96	The atmosphere here is perfect for our date.
96	31 78 62 45 94 79 181 67 144 212 96	retro movies directors are very much idealistic in nature ,as they have lots of passionate stuff to show on their movies
96	10 178 65 34 17 48 108 147 56 118 96	this warms my heart and makes me want to be with you

97	158 115 29 87 127 145 172 214 173 34 97	This is a ship that fought in the greatest battle of World War 2.
97	12 172 24 18 212 50 214 202 59 112 97	I've finally made it to a lavish lifestyle with beautiful destinations.

97	11 54 51 21 196 19 124 181 168 163 97	Trash is terrible but in it's own way a form of art and expression.
97	195 109 198 178 11 36 151 175 133 22 97	Such a simple statement for such an amazing and important piece of work. It does it hardly any justice.

97	64 141 136 2 115 11 194 164 68 205 97	I believe this is the best way to achieve our location.

97	153 160 196 22 143 23 25 85 96 34 97	That relief must be a mile long full of artistic carving.
97	145 69 202 134 38 148 189 50 57 158 97	What a modern war hero! Thank you for keep us safe from evil!
97	57 212 148 167 22 102 207 68 210 179 97	To us a little plant on the side of the road is actually connected to the largest network in the world... nature
97	163 165 48 158 136 150 113 56 76 21 97	Chandeliers are great to have in homes. I think this would be a great centerpiece for a grand room.
97	199 201 54 138 89 213 79 53 194 18 97	YAY a snowy knoll!  We need to get the sleds right now and take a midnight run!
97	72 133 141 27 4 56 119 136 58 21 97	Those trees are magnificient
97	112 94 177 153 83 55 132 39 75 129 97	Looks like phemonemal wine tasting I'd love to be apart of
97	22 3 123 44 125 19 155 211 178 96 97	I'd eat the whole thing in seconds flat
97	212 155 115 183 96 61 55 134 189 37 97	I'm doing my floor like this
97	122 193 33 152 107 123 175 18 197 111 97	I want to be given a plaque like that plaque. For my contributions to our world.
97	2 198 55 75 7 18 120 14 19 4 97	I want to see four thousand of these jar cozies made!
97	63 158 166 204 39 115 57 208 136 203 97	The creamy white color of this bottle lends a wonderful tone to the fragrant and bold taste of the coffee flavor that is inside of it.

97	114 140 44 211 184 80 111 179 104 108 97	Models of spaceships are just one of the many ways to express an appreciation for the beauty of human creativity.

97	103 119 118 36 209 74 110 167 2 164 97	I spend a lot of weekends on boats such as these
97	21 93 185 208 212 7 141 32 154 75 97	What a magnificent building! Glorious!
97	124 57 53 143 7 67 149 21 120 140 97	What an array of hairstyles. This is a crowd I wouldn't be caught dead in.
98	75 145 5 137 148 104 108 59 87 186 98	Why in the world would anyone go here, even to take a opic?
98	187 94 60 210 154 62 178 13 64 86 98	This is an odd flower, where are the buds?
98	196 202 16 77 79 85 112 71 122 127 98	How is that tree growing out of brick?
98	32 129 15 111 77 186 68 151 126 4 98	Wow, I can't believe I'm seeing this.
98	145 122 179 34 125 139 185 159 80 205 98	What a happy person, I wonder why?
98	87 159 186 10 2 169 109 1 27 78 98	How does he play so fast?
98	30 204 162 206 140 205 100 156 82 60 98	This sign just looks so out of place here.
98	31 185 54 201 160 196 83 165 125 26 98	Looks like Vodka there?? I don't know how people drink that stuff
98	183 123 87 167 69 141 194 206 104 103 98	What a cool device!
98	48 147 63 166 141 196 137 31 65 19 98	The view confuses me
98	26 59 128 204 114 139 170 105 18 65 98	What is going on? a bird eats bananas?
98	52 170 40 24 133 20 125 145 167 66 98	I am astonished by the photography
98	73 158 91 164 212 211 187 143 120 186 98	to arms and to legs
98	43 62 100 22 192 54 173 212 3 149 98	Did she just score a basket or is she tired and looking to take a break?
98	210 25 87 203 59 50 41 212 78 100 98	Are they seriously together!?
98	151 124 190 106 212 180 137 127 19 166 98	Does this design end or does it go on forever?
98	50 131 183 16 203 14 204 145 66 208 98	I can't believe they would let them paint that weird scene on the wall.
98	197 36 200 42 140 67 117 161 150 70 98	This is SO weird! I was there that night and everyone was searched for cameras and phones, how did you get this photo?! This is SO COOL! Do you have more? I don't get it!!
98	123 77 33 6 206 76 162 95 207 68 98	He looks unsure of himself
98	159 2 33 34 39 36 116 205 146 63 98	All of these ballot measures are just overwhelming to me.
98	31 82 121 144 110 137 129 59 191 163 98	Cute kids with an odd smile
98	135 26 158 80 102 186 194 66 6 200 98	They could not believe that the quality of the chocolate was so exquisite.
98	157 144 1 92 202 174 189 10 129 212 98	This memo from Wayne Johnston just doesn't make sense. He might be asking for donations?
98	190 50 212 49 28 189 64 5 101 99 98	I don't get it. What is it I'm looking at?
98	42 143 121 120 109 7 35 67 173 3 98	This is not very christmas-y
98	62 36 176 139 50 10 32 119 5 73 98	It amazes me people are able to run a business directly under the place they live.
98	143 177 198 199 12 19 187 87 21 147 98	What the heck is that liquid?
98	103 141 93 21 2 174 119 59 170 156 98	You guys were at the zoo?  When?
98	1 89 150 50 128 67 194 25 34 95 98	I can't for the life of me figure out what that little boy and his mom are smiling about.
98	22 57 106 201 126 5 117 9 166 215 98	Was this taken in the winter? I'm not sure why there is so much snow.
98	201 79 97 147 72 75 124 141 42 135 98	Is this the back seat or the front seat? What am I looking at?
98	2 69 201 13 143 43 178 134 48 193 98	Why does part of the hillside lack vegetation? What! Pretty cool.
98	174 4 100 112 40 197 152 95 56 201 98	I am shocked that so few people showed up to this lecture!
98	14 197 17 101 193 18 169 48 6 80 98	This man is going to crash!
98	106 60 181 163 180 66 174 135 46 142 98	Why is that man passing the bar?
98	42 180 47 31 129 52 164 70 181 16 98	Woah how long have they been underwater for?
98	101 209 116 173 92 144 166 65 3 72 98	I am kind of in awe of this roof.
98	148 25 91 137 53 164 138 75 139 171 98	I am in awe of these beautiful flowers.
98	103 185 181 78 205 64 95 209 85 125 98	Why is he singing and not playing guitar?
98	89 152 117 5 133 86 95 154 202 176 98	I wonder how people can learn to play the piano.
98	119 11 47 68 102 32 137 209 14 39 98	tadpoles  fishing over
98	54 100 94 56 173 66 127 179 99 138 98	Wow, do people walk up that tower?  How can they do it?
98	75 91 180 162 114 212 200 113 71 86 98	Wow, what a concert, but where did the band go.
98	202 32 55 176 40 48 86 126 136 169 98	What are those people looking at
98	123 21 201 70 183 215 175 80 71 190 98	what were you doing here?
98	73 127 47 77 40 156 75 53 200 145 98	This is so gorgeous! I can't tell if I am seeing fog or clouds, but either way, this is beautiful.
98	57 64 4 66 69 124 78 185 89 65 98	How amazing is it that people get so into comics?!
98	165 35 75 6 136 123 89 60 16 27 98	what the HECK are their NECKS even DOING
98	75 37 197 169 76 20 154 39 131 27 98	What does that even say?
98	3 57 165 126 111 178 131 114 61 97 98	I wonder how they were able to fit all of that text on the sign.
98	34 110 43 42 99 118 64 165 92 140 98	Is this a drag show?
98	160 57 174 86 39 206 176 102 175 169 98	Wait....What?! How in the world?!
98	160 45 87 211 180 106 123 133 173 47 98	I wonder what caused these rocks to shoot out from the ground like that.
98	12 134 22 119 188 40 39 185 44 192 98	Whoa... dude... what's happening? Where are all these weird lights coming from?
98	144 185 145 175 1 7 103 91 163 181 98	Is this a dinosaur or a bull?
98	89 180 79 208 215 190 58 160 115 25 98	What is this weird looking bird
98	168 144 85 176 184 62 215 48 64 177 98	I cannot believe how beautiful those flowers are!
98	123 197 56 140 184 199 71 101 84 130 98	I do not know how someone thought of that kind of shirt!
98	80 1 73 102 77 129 169 85 23 124 98	I am amazed that a cliff like this can exist.
98	27 115 32 64 93 51 76 135 136 35 98	This ancient artifact seems as if it has a lot of knowledge.
98	154 29 139 88 15 193 140 101 60 175 98	That guitar will make the sound of angels!
98	128 34 125 44 62 161 110 25 75 23 98	Why...are...these people starting at me??? WHattt?!?
98	117 213 64 200 174 78 103 184 118 175 98	Are those pumpkins chasing after them?
98	199 30 73 13 64 145 22 156 99 181 98	What the heck to those numbers mean??
98	24 124 149 214 67 145 213 193 196 27 98	Wow, they look like life is treating them good!
98	173 191 114 1 26 9 145 135 199 150 98	To see this picture is one thing but to be there in person, Wow!
98	179 38 85 212 215 118 151 63 66 21 98	is he really singing and playing guitar?
98	150 13 74 20 116 56 113 65 7 203 98	Why is she covering up her face?
98	165 12 101 130 8 126 131 167 146 121 98	What city is this? Is it Europe or Asia, is it my city?
98	209 27 161 41 29 171 146 81 24 197 98	where the heck is that place!
98	205 172 208 69 146 135 105 100 145 17 98	I wonder what she is looking at. I'd like to know more about where this photo was taken, it doesn't make sense to me.
98	178 97 92 137 150 124 35 122 185 7 98	What could be beyond that narrow entryway?
98	20 93 133 27 142 19 6 30 139 26 98	What holiday is it?
98	114 146 53 168 14 106 23 156 57 15 98	It's amazing that these types of constructions stand for so long. The power of ingenuity.
98	181 59 56 37 174 30 46 117 186 31 98	I don't understand what or how this happened.
98	189 73 130 168 69 207 165 194 164 51 98	Wow this is crazy I don't understand it!
98	194 196 182 99 52 211 40 127 43 125 98	WHAT IS THIS?!
98	174 14 143 38 44 115 167 62 214 182 98	This magic trick took us 5 hours to figure out.
98	116 94 82 106 21 18 96 164 175 79 98	Why did I have to set up all the dividers when I knew no one would show up.
98	126 107 64 149 172 205 102 154 1 91 98	But why are there so many pepsi cans on the table?
98	194 58 203 104 37 128 85 152 138 157 98	Sorry, pardon me confusion; are they smoking or are they getting smoked?
98	130 30 84 3 77 131 16 201 20 174 98	How did they manage to get such a perfectly timed shot?
98	107 181 108 185 168 199 13 190 93 72 98	I am amazed that her ice cream doesnt melt.
98	91 87 45 44 94 38 152 164 29 128 98	Is it a building with 5 floors of restaurants?
98	55 116 87 198 51 148 75 93 5 141 98	Driving the rudimentary cars is mind boggling.
98	202 36 206 88 19 82 182 123 164 3 98	This animal looks as if it is lost yet stalking prey.
98	204 108 183 32 66 138 211 71 78 157 98	What are these people doing? I don't understand.
98	208 65 199 116 1 50 183 106 31 88 98	WHy are so many in a small place?
98	73 7 113 30 150 48 37 64 134 9 98	Are all those boats facing the same direction?
98	9 25 123 183 89 116 32 130 162 158 98	What are they staring at?
98	157 17 193 150 44 114 60 58 185 147 98	Walking his bike after a ramp? Interesting approach
98	43 203 7 72 150 130 73 134 192 166 98	Wow, this door handle is so strange and unique.
98	37 11 60 134 135 184 30 28 5 155 98	Wow, is this the forbidden city in China, or part of red square?
98	200 171 14 68 121 38 180 81 174 196 98	That smog can be really confusing and annoying.
98	115 5 194 137 12 103 17 74 112 2 98	Who let Jake use my hair straightener for chopsticks again?
98	10 179 123 149 57 135 158 41 161 54 98	That is a huge house, how many rooms could there be!
98	108 17 165 22 83 18 94 192 190 24 98	nice young fellows who look bewildered
98	210 122 165 164 159 74 130 132 144 204 98	I can't believe how nicely they are sitting.
98	54 184 163 142 199 72 17 182 172 75 98	Why does a guy with such big hands have such a small phone?
98	93 210 19 37 141 183 50 76 97 56 98	This color has me perplexed.
98	5 56 204 104 213 54 124 123 92 114 98	What in God's name is that for?
98	55 179 194 169 44 142 62 147 139 5 98	Is it tomato or Red Pepper? I don't understand...
98	196 29 110 26 122 141 13 160 215 84 98	the fast driving car startles me to the edge
98	38 31 152 40 213 10 119 127 45 60 98	is this a citroen or what?
98	93 173 212 18 28 195 206 125 147 157 98	I wonder how she married a short fellow! may be true love!
98	33 60 11 76 157 45 182 61 202 199 98	Hmm, I am not sure that a Jesus statue would normally hang out with the other statue.
98	154 11 150 135 205 21 7 190 163 96 98	This man, I have seen him before, but where?
98	118 128 39 208 109 157 135 178 139 34 98	Wasn't our beach house right here before the storm?
98	179 185 73 53 68 147 6 89 195 1 98	Why are so many people clapping with a frown on their face?
98	59 5 12 90 86 181 27 199 101 182 98	I can't tell if this man is posing or if his car just broke down at warehouse on the outskirts of a city.
98	192 29 188 24 110 194 6 14 77 157 98	Why on earth didn't those ladies do their hair if they're dressing up?
98	60 35 15 64 27 75 118 169 104 100 98	How does the rider maintain such balance?
98	171 170 21 106 186 82 75 150 180 194 98	I wonder if she's taking notes, or cheating. I honestly can't tell.
98	196 118 136 65 108 181 201 143 26 176 98	How tall is this tree? It appears to go on forever!
98	97 193 28 17 165 199 86 111 170 186 98	What is this shiny garment, and what purpose does it serve?
98	180 119 111 205 142 112 5 81 59 209 98	What the heck is this guy even doing?
98	103 14 121 124 84 182 6 100 50 180 98	Why is that monkey there?
98	61 90 177 174 48 43 156 10 203 97 98	What an amazing agricultural display. I wonder if it is edible.
98	6 215 165 34 27 17 179 90 157 115 98	I don't know where this goes.
98	206 125 113 163 126 150 167 208 179 147 98	What are those lights?
98	159 81 55 10 135 156 84 178 198 117 98	What is this necklace made out of?
98	97 12 117 36 25 169 144 22 174 105 98	What kind of animal is that?  It looks like a sheep goat.
98	130 123 122 13 87 65 144 69 136 210 98	Is that a shadow?
98	88 159 120 40 45 173 165 179 195 77 98	That's incredible!  How can she balance that on her head?
98	206 171 193 19 155 59 55 18 170 188 98	Why are people driving in snowy conditions?
98	15 91 182 107 26 164 31 90 115 175 98	Why soes the little firl on the right have a ponytail coming off the top of her head?
98	206 167 157 65 4 117 169 105 62 140 98	I wonder how the car even got there in such bad condition.
98	214 24 149 211 76 124 69 213 93 182 98	What on earth would you need all those ingredients for.  It's going to go bad before you are able to use it.
98	151 122 77 126 181 134 214 53 210 92 98	Is this an advertisement?
98	138 151 11 157 158 27 210 57 185 167 98	Why would someone make a snow cone on that?
98	172 122 112 199 184 41 180 175 27 187 98	Looks cool but I still have no idea how tanks move!
98	72 14 96 131 89 105 75 183 111 7 98	That is one crazy cool car!
98	66 215 151 156 145 169 72 140 16 142 98	Hmm, which team is the blue shirt on? I'm confused
98	26 93 140 130 87 158 120 179 18 189 98	I am just not sure where this is? Is it in the US?
98	11 4 142 200 45 147 152 107 185 8 98	What is this food?
98	57 22 169 80 44 110 33 196 49 137 98	What is he even holding up to show me?
98	131 117 78 213 16 175 4 199 185 166 98	How do they even do that??
98	17 40 52 184 182 67 90 183 12 50 98	It blows my mind these places are real
98	172 140 4 26 34 164 96 145 161 59 98	I really can't tell which way that car is supposed to go.
98	210 159 153 26 156 95 200 88 209 201 98	I cant believe both his feet are that far off the ground!
98	42 207 162 100 73 142 91 10 137 140 98	I am bewildered by police cars.
98	194 74 177 48 31 77 119 9 210 99 98	no idea what kind of factory is
98	172 35 121 169 25 69 135 36 90 40 98	I have no clue what that lady is doing. Is it a bottle of some sort? And what on earth is that man drinking?
98	137 38 134 194 166 138 4 158 190 91 98	Why has the sky changed to the color orange?!
98	168 109 139 105 162 191 74 62 166 15 98	Um where is this? What does it mean? I'm confused
98	209 195 58 90 73 17 59 61 144 116 98	Is this a couple or friends? Is the person on the right a guy or a girl? I can't tell
98	192 188 174 165 114 32 34 31 81 26 98	Is this a statue or a grave marker?  Can it be both?
98	177 214 6 140 121 199 18 28 117 74 98	SHes flying down that mountain on the crotchrocket!
98	199 180 96 48 112 114 185 64 188 107 98	It is amazing how they captured the singer's emotions.
98	125 111 1 120 96 49 117 73 30 207 98	This is the weirdest looking doll on the planet. Who would want one?
98	31 106 135 105 96 112 182 186 48 191 98	How long has this dog livd in that river?
98	4 67 197 6 188 133 8 69 42 71 98	These people should not be touching like this?
98	45 31 209 71 9 151 191 134 54 207 98	There is nothing but undeveloped farmland as far as the eye can see!
98	189 102 142 50 140 179 126 155 138 170 98	How can you not see how hard I worked on this?
98	191 18 67 88 181 21 15 137 77 73 98	I'm perplexed by this cover page
98	20 79 25 97 139 35 67 21 18 76 98	Why is there water shooting out the side of the fountain?
98	200 158 35 79 111 115 38 201 197 132 98	Where is this?  What type of place has all these things?
98	99 22 39 142 65 4 151 30 67 176 98	What is under the tree?
98	26 65 159 13 34 108 82 88 176 150 98	What is going on here?
98	9 12 196 204 141 54 211 53 75 179 98	Why did they trough stuff all over the plate like that?
98	103 172 196 95 169 155 19 183 148 153 98	How did they get all those scooters in there? How did they then get up to the station?
98	76 57 172 195 123 11 135 63 18 46 98	What's going on here?
98	94 166 69 151 102 175 37 167 77 5 98	Beautiful and surprising shot.
98	200 150 152 11 138 80 188 18 45 174 98	What the heck is that below the window?
98	42 161 11 78 33 94 138 116 61 158 98	The person saw the puzzled look on my face while presenting the award.
98	215 41 56 19 112 108 173 203 36 176 98	I had no idea this man was accomplished so much!
98	61 149 143 1 144 2 196 112 69 109 98	How did we get ourselves in this predicament?
98	149 36 20 44 89 109 21 33 5 83 98	Why arent the other people here yet, we told them Noon!
98	122 130 68 176 110 118 36 125 70 66 98	The contractor said out apartment would be done by the 1st, and it's still not finished on the 31st!
98	21 177 151 99 89 134 19 85 108 9 98	i dont understand what these women are doing, can someone please tell me?
98	154 95 80 170 113 60 183 52 54 196 98	What are we looking at?
98	96 43 194 76 193 113 146 202 95 88 98	the stairs make you walk in a circe
98	79 89 119 38 142 86 45 162 159 37 98	Where are they that she wears a lab coat?
98	112 166 141 40 63 139 133 84 183 198 98	This tree makes me question life, itself.
98	132 69 73 139 43 23 39 105 164 65 98	Why isn't the subway moving?
98	193 50 176 80 42 39 169 49 147 151 98	How can he carry all those waters, will he drink them all too?
98	92 37 188 127 23 170 48 113 177 31 98	this picture is one of the makeup is girls
98	61 50 47 56 76 106 145 12 114 111 98	I would never have imagined these two together...
98	212 118 43 109 180 117 101 154 161 55 98	Such a wonder of modern human design.
98	27 205 37 183 14 57 72 45 61 108 98	I cannot imagine what would happen to the poor soul that falls in here.
98	154 15 194 106 183 87 143 42 136 54 98	How does the floor not cave in?
98	122 192 87 18 188 123 64 78 198 130 98	What is he doing and why?
98	92 114 132 194 56 187 46 182 23 156 98	Is that the door back to the future?
98	109 142 161 69 138 49 76 210 148 136 98	What does HAGS mean? Is that the child's name?!?
98	85 183 34 180 194 191 167 150 32 106 98	Why is that baby so fat??
98	114 167 184 179 127 12 21 205 48 161 98	Which city is this?!?
99	82 65 1 67 193 62 119 34 36 171 99	I want to drive down that road, fast and quick!
99	91 52 157 100 193 158 16 185 58 113 99	The greens look dried out, while the bread doesn't know whether to hide or run away from the plate.
99	62 188 184 35 152 88 157 97 53 142 99	Umm, this is gross.
99	158 73 160 203 165 52 123 56 86 89 99	That person's eye is bigger on one side I bet it is really embarrassing.
99	8 150 149 181 135 185 81 33 155 28 99	Can they not afford chairs?
99	54 90 148 191 89 106 164 55 135 192 99	This guy looks a little weird.
99	177 114 100 98 125 152 10 56 22 187 99	The trees in this photo are hideously maintained
99	124 51 71 13 214 137 108 144 29 158 99	The sand seems a bit prickly to me
99	187 30 186 172 119 215 178 200 23 49 99	The woman said that she was not fine with the instrument
99	64 28 26 112 10 96 12 212 68 65 99	Typical people getting lost on such a simple trail.
99	133 121 204 74 140 80 210 87 122 146 99	Shake that hair a little more! The audience likes sweat!
99	114 88 183 94 32 16 130 166 93 61 99	These grates make it impossible to see
99	123 5 55 95 163 65 191 166 146 105 99	She looks like she knows right from wrong. Hint- Wrong is the fun one!
99	28 52 83 151 87 156 133 111 150 116 99	I doubt any of them have a sense of style.
99	113 23 1 109 63 199 161 48 44 156 99	She  is just not fast, strong or fit enough to win.
99	49 132 31 215 211 145 195 4 50 59 99	They couldn't finish the rest of the design?
99	122 23 37 178 14 192 59 43 182 33 99	This looks absolutely disgusting. Where is the baby back ribs?
99	163 173 139 180 145 56 149 80 109 115 99	Oh a lot of people love this sport, too bloody for me!
99	1 186 133 91 89 58 26 175 103 29 99	That rock is boring and should be built upon
99	53 9 129 25 74 176 135 151 190 78 99	On my way in these smooth waves.
99	107 24 17 143 142 105 74 206 21 198 99	I'm blue da da dee dee dee da!
99	143 54 193 139 110 75 47 127 27 146 99	I'll be staying somewhere else while I'm here thank you.
99	72 141 102 126 56 1 103 11 79 65 99	Look at all the public spaces to urinate!
99	96 63 135 182 132 195 80 36 213 208 99	Yuk! I Hate when  people dry their ugly clothes outside.
99	24 127 4 39 176 207 191 22 77 196 99	This looks like poor craftsmanship.
99	160 202 136 84 138 89 86 173 105 205 99	Jeez, open your eyes, will ya?
99	146 32 96 117 41 126 62 8 75 10 99	I bet a bug as colorful as that bites and is poisonous.
99	104 2 47 179 141 15 121 18 92 120 99	Why do the elderly have to wrinkle an otherwise smooth picture?
99	25 46 111 153 84 95 160 75 70 180 99	I believe she needs more lessons.
99	183 162 15 87 164 28 182 111 159 215 99	Why don't they have more chairs for the people to sit on?
99	7 83 109 167 49 115 207 47 9 188 99	a strange angle through a bridge gate. hmm.
99	165 116 45 202 16 112 70 129 93 209 99	looks nasty to eat
99	156 141 162 45 206 70 177 10 158 30 99	That's.... definitely a blue pool.
99	153 109 129 91 24 18 201 208 178 9 99	The view is rigid
99	160 5 178 91 28 124 37 20 213 162 99	The city is a cruel and unforgiving place.  Everyone wants something from you.
99	143 195 67 75 123 49 55 52 82 93 99	Yeah. Anybody can take a flower photo. Pass.
99	11 82 168 118 151 18 205 63 201 32 99	There's a reason it's called talking like a sailor!
99	4 127 78 94 69 175 191 132 42 183 99	Dangerous work environment
99	68 115 75 72 212 70 187 207 25 174 99	This seems like a pretty intense game.
99	167 148 27 200 110 96 92 195 185 175 99	Why are they standing so close to the water?
99	68 208 5 179 116 153 160 18 115 158 99	Ugh, what a plate of garbage.
99	164 151 18 179 109 145 135 174 30 53 99	Look at those teeth, they're huge!
99	176 208 60 29 38 39 9 163 196 122 99	Look at all dem trees
99	210 192 130 98 174 179 35 105 85 186 99	He is not really that handsome
99	139 88 182 12 197 200 193 44 121 171 99	This drink tastes gritty and poorly mixed.
99	72 76 9 60 11 39 94 104 160 205 99	Okay now gentlemen, not too close
99	201 60 116 85 189 101 62 139 16 11 99	Wouldn't want to live in that dump
99	10 163 121 122 120 144 23 35 209 123 99	What is this, a pile of fairy poop?
99	106 129 20 111 46 88 203 170 42 87 99	The suits are ugly.
99	51 17 45 155 83 196 138 205 72 103 99	Leaning against that rock'll be uncomfortable.
99	184 179 34 143 53 68 91 127 120 208 99	they are bad at drumming
99	44 160 84 18 157 180 60 21 200 75 99	This freaking rain is ruining my day
99	91 178 115 131 117 29 168 55 58 25 99	Rear ended? That's what she said!
99	80 65 123 82 110 73 1 5 138 2 99	Did anyone teach these kids any mannerism? Can the atleast make a straight line?
99	189 153 185 16 69 82 206 184 149 8 99	What a display!
99	108 104 141 196 174 214 157 139 57 168 99	Two dumb peasants doing a stupid folk dance
99	203 103 122 74 128 40 94 169 46 193 99	No more dogs in the house.
99	91 177 107 94 111 126 210 207 64 85 99	It looks like she needs to have her hair redone.
99	153 46 90 128 203 189 176 41 192 64 99	That attempt at art looks like a stain across the building
99	94 9 202 69 132 5 178 187 46 117 99	These green pants don't even match.
99	135 100 118 175 205 186 52 5 69 63 99	That is a poor photographer.
99	112 52 183 188 202 97 59 72 56 189 99	What are these clowns doing?
99	132 11 49 93 205 150 58 29 31 113 99	Some idiots might think this view is serene but all I see are ocean polluters and marine animal murderers.
99	172 144 58 126 195 178 181 11 176 206 99	What a dumb looking train
99	15 43 77 193 98 212 9 91 11 54 99	That's a depressing and ugly building.
99	92 135 107 87 213 35 114 117 4 2 99	That looks like a bloody worm.
99	134 94 120 177 185 163 184 195 148 37 99	That bear looks like its about to croak.
99	174 82 44 115 12 73 203 214 181 106 99	Stupid ugly little flower
99	127 168 65 126 211 52 164 58 68 207 99	This could look nice if someone would mow the lawn and tend to it better
99	116 161 154 170 32 60 50 89 100 192 99	Firm, strict, blunt
99	5 149 6 170 183 160 69 161 104 205 99	What a hunk of useless metal! The car's not good for anything except the scrapyard.
99	39 1 80 115 190 213 50 117 45 200 99	I hate that the chair is broken, cant look at it
99	105 100 20 59 96 54 92 209 117 49 99	The font doesn't help with the word.
99	174 171 179 4 122 26 109 104 25 167 99	planes don't fly smoothly through dark and heavy clouds
99	195 20 118 50 207 128 76 12 5 150 99	It says no standing so stay on your feet even if you're tired.
99	33 170 179 135 113 156 215 11 32 205 99	You call this architecturue?
99	197 72 116 184 77 173 191 75 20 194 99	I bet those are dirty jokes enscribed.
99	1 74 175 81 205 88 97 50 164 120 99	That bike is leaning too much.  Looks like the driver doesn't know what he is doing.
99	94 9 8 196 139 123 100 90 214 104 99	That looks terrible and upsets me.
99	213 95 49 137 170 112 193 70 58 150 99	Could this man be any taller?

99	148 130 177 143 87 215 152 86 49 116 99	He must be doing a great performance, but the photographer is pathetic.
99	47 159 170 27 12 73 8 84 215 57 99	I guess you could call this a lake.
99	153 127 88 35 133 110 80 59 142 115 99	And to think, that horse was almost glue.
99	48 114 55 170 206 141 122 71 83 192 99	WTF, they want me to slide on chains through rocks and bushes to get to the bottom?
99	171 165 61 208 137 179 23 107 129 172 99	These tires might blast off any moment.
99	144 140 52 57 63 198 196 172 91 22 99	Another musuem in the middle of no where.
99	49 125 166 41 33 184 60 127 62 37 99	The girl is not even in focus, I can only see an oar
99	187 128 198 165 81 51 66 17 34 139 99	Put on some shoes.  Nobody wants your stinky feet in the ocean.
99	167 125 129 190 140 69 191 62 192 170 99	I find this place to be very unappealing, look at the dark ground.Not so cool.
99	185 15 89 124 12 76 62 19 8 79 99	The reflection of the clouds on the ocean makes the water looks rough.
99	106 142 130 16 90 190 17 150 68 88 99	What ugly people.
99	28 87 15 30 64 81 121 177 162 163 99	These guy's uniforms are way too tight.  They need to lose a couple of pounds before they wear them again.
99	89 202 80 172 186 165 146 163 47 37 99	What an ugly duo.
99	74 215 63 16 142 91 127 65 103 205 99	They rote so small on these napkins, I can hardly read them.
99	102 189 162 141 50 118 23 48 57 199 99	Darkness is always an impolite in nature!
99	124 101 39 149 132 9 10 153 122 73 99	The grass all over the field is shaggy and green.
99	16 27 178 7 180 120 89 25 148 195 99	I will never buy an old ugly car like this one.
99	64 63 45 11 41 136 103 114 108 101 99	The jungle is completely harsh filled with poisonous snakes!

99	73 118 13 89 46 196 17 81 59 110 99	Those islands aren't worth even looking at and I bet they are full of garbage.
99	107 129 38 45 100 187 102 197 10 143 99	Such a run down place what a mess!
99	202 157 183 32 30 10 69 148 129 122 99	This is a hideous color.
99	5 56 17 151 193 168 61 183 6 120 99	That charcuterie plate is unappealing.
99	213 132 151 144 115 48 198 187 125 62 99	Some hispter trash concert
99	210 121 181 185 78 159 85 70 124 2 99	Why are these runners running right by my house?!
99	106 33 183 79 60 174 23 113 119 89 99	I bet she slips and falls on her face before she tries to dive.
99	7 9 169 23 148 140 128 120 3 89 99	I would hate to sit on that branch.
99	171 45 139 157 65 136 73 173 104 117 99	Why do frogs have to take up the entire pond and leave no room for anything else.
99	156 138 157 207 112 10 8 101 102 104 99	How poor do you have to be to live like this?
99	193 184 78 34 105 37 210 148 83 186 99	She should get a better haircut
99	56 79 204 18 139 180 145 31 2 73 99	This picture is bad, it's dark and blurry
99	187 135 64 82 142 104 194 75 14 62 99	Cats are a waste of fur.
99	192 72 28 97 163 159 136 181 102 214 99	My grandmother looks like her but her farts probably smell better.
99	202 64 68 192 30 121 151 210 197 185 99	She's look a lot better if she combed her hair before taking the stage.
99	90 7 161 21 180 64 48 170 9 50 99	An oldest band
99	160 100 173 213 111 35 212 145 120 192 99	This building looks like it may disintegrate any time now.

99	62 61 20 133 52 161 205 136 29 125 99	Stop putting people on packing, it's so stupid.
99	182 147 195 110 88 35 45 200 113 9 99	Those people are way too comfortable with each other
99	121 177 109 171 204 60 11 130 54 209 99	Why would you want such an old car?
99	205 120 103 119 135 154 118 143 39 59 99	This looks easy.
99	65 67 45 76 158 116 178 114 36 7 99	color, bright, spring
99	195 187 206 76 86 186 146 180 199 139 99	I would stay there if it weren't for the rich snobs.
100	17 5 99 204 137 159 49 177 37 108 100	What a magestic animal.
100	138 78 103 105 136 2 41 117 169 110 100	It looks like a beautiful snow has fallen on that plant in the middle of an arid wasteland.
100	199 46 63 68 182 120 62 94 41 148 100	The artwork is fantastic
100	204 78 92 23 215 11 107 37 142 43 100	I love the wood work and the simple designs of the water spout.

100	77 45 22 156 120 72 178 40 84 12 100	I could take those signs and sell them for a fortune.
100	24 136 161 195 72 150 193 163 198 52 100	Humans have unlimited potential.
100	56 68 19 196 82 193 155 182 210 116 100	This would be the perfect spot to skip rocks.
100	76 21 64 112 201 119 162 209 98 16 100	Look at how fast they're skating!

100	149 137 14 115 62 162 213 101 76 26 100	Watching these children carelessly color makes me feel good.  They know of no problems in the world.
100	159 146 21 214 34 193 213 90 153 33 100	What a delightfully exquisite concert to attend.
100	101 4 127 205 14 113 15 76 17 145 100	Wonder how I would hold up on one of these.
100	7 176 171 197 195 28 129 183 131 180 100	I would like to take the stringer off this ray and try to create a culinary dish out of it.

100	136 33 93 211 215 19 113 159 104 153 100	I wonder what it was like to live in this building when it was first built. I've always imagined I'd be a good Princess!

100	38 150 91 109 13 204 52 79 9 116 100	The athlete probably landed this one!
100	166 142 203 89 66 5 95 151 182 65 100	They look like they're crying, but to me they could totally just be covering their eyes to get surprised by one of them.
100	153 82 60 144 48 136 55 40 190 59 100	What beautiful lights this mortorcycle has.

100	51 79 56 164 163 17 153 6 10 213 100	The guy on the rights' face. What secret is he trying to hide?
100	153 76 211 141 78 64 26 20 159 88 100	I believe this scene was removed from The Labyrinth because there was not enough glitter in it.
100	135 149 59 114 99 52 119 199 213 14 100	Smile for the honeymoon shot!

100	193 176 146 130 75 139 85 116 24 140 100	Maybe I can grow old in love like them
100	101 104 28 154 153 206 98 75 164 82 100	I want a view like that
100	208 213 4 88 71 138 93 44 114 137 100	Well I'll be! I've always wondered what a close up a pigeon's eye looked liked! The colors of orange, amber and honey swirl together beautifully!

100	115 101 156 41 204 154 137 15 167 152 100	what an idyllic scene.
100	207 146 38 44 192 130 74 97 26 37 100	I wish my kitchen had this much open space.
100	57 10 178 103 176 163 208 190 155 137 100	Must be worth waiting for
100	102 11 52 111 50 79 18 121 6 3 100	AN interesting piece of furniture
100	4 185 177 95 113 20 106 193 52 192 100	I wonder what the sign says?
100	200 178 130 31 40 193 133 205 191 107 100	That color would be so brilliant on my car
100	155 10 47 181 203 122 208 131 106 211 100	The colors and design in the hall has such a detail it makes me feel like royalty.
100	164 158 180 6 202 70 137 170 54 127 100	when I am in the mood, I get spiritual
101	26 76 173 156 99 52 141 123 6 145 101	If those cats had some patience, all of them could get a turn at the milk bowl.
101	44 161 147 90 43 20 155 174 45 134 101	It's always lovely to see what a bit of rain and light can achieve.
101	212 134 153 38 79 83 115 108 60 164 101	This is a bar I presume?
101	204 201 3 73 129 54 126 195 98 213 101	That is well organized.
101	70 38 88 115 55 58 161 183 189 29 101	This photo is nothing special.
101	155 7 214 78 79 196 58 5 181 89 101	That skull must have been placed there by someone, no way it ended up there by itself.
101	29 39 45 33 208 47 52 21 199 94 101	No picture shown.
101	192 36 21 179 69 196 175 77 31 27 101	The woman is very wise
101	14 95 77 143 3 160 113 123 158 120 101	These goofballs are so theatrical!
101	147 102 23 168 26 70 123 177 98 12 101	That is an ornament of glass for decoration.
101	23 89 118 40 213 39 88 135 64 136 101	Seeing the canyons go on for miles makes me think about the power of water and erosion.
101	26 67 38 212 150 167 114 111 79 56 101	This woman had a professional photographer take this picture to make it look as good as possible.
101	79 118 125 162 67 64 7 92 104 188 101	This was probably a reproduction, so it's not worth as much.
101	58 139 172 70 104 32 165 174 95 158 101	If I turn back now, I will get back by noon.
101	14 168 154 17 16 120 42 175 179 132 101	When she's done she needs her hands washed.
101	11 210 132 102 17 84 208 52 161 58 101	This must be a nice restaurant.
101	30 5 95 129 143 189 102 48 156 49 101	The horse appears to be seeking water.
101	133 111 14 204 173 154 91 199 109 94 101	He should close the door so he doesn't fall.
101	191 139 190 76 140 31 55 77 126 49 101	When the sun goes down, the lights come on.
101	147 44 125 50 121 54 95 151 166 115 101	This color is neautral.
101	198 14 7 3 51 130 142 205 127 56 101	It takes a lot of work to produce and perform in a play.
101	202 104 26 69 62 132 55 117 155 168 101	The building is made to look like it is tilted although it is perfectly straight.
101	79 19 121 177 62 204 108 155 85 162 101	Waiting your turn at a buffet can be difficult when you are very hungry.
101	107 7 130 172 112 132 70 153 210 44 101	I can only assume this young lady likes roses.
101	211 117 90 129 161 192 37 186 31 114 101	Hope there are no wires across walkways!
101	182 162 115 71 79 3 130 206 58 72 101	These tree are not only beautiful but have been here growing for many years.
101	100 85 164 16 152 26 44 205 177 173 101	This dam is holding up quite nicely.
101	161 157 211 129 204 45 171 109 74 22 101	They are going to need water if they are going to float the boat.
101	203 6 149 153 79 183 98 48 86 215 101	That tree looks to be alive and healthy.
101	112 129 52 38 162 185 135 20 31 15 101	They must have just won awards, good job!
101	63 35 132 93 66 110 91 1 113 84 101	midwest wind farm
101	99 66 69 4 171 9 11 62 82 195 101	That's the perfect size to eat after a big meal.
101	70 132 143 23 210 149 5 37 88 141 101	Both the buildings and the city are beautiful here.
101	32 28 152 22 26 23 179 172 169 182 101	The grass is good for the land
101	202 197 71 5 198 194 35 127 103 1 101	Those people need more clothes
101	70 34 193 202 91 26 174 212 135 178 101	The trees need tk be
101	55 123 60 165 169 56 83 183 89 175 101	Proud, Strong, Smart
101	63 38 148 95 153 36 125 20 60 11 101	That car is driving too fast.
101	11 185 32 21 187 69 123 64 138 179 101	this looks potentially dangerous
101	62 56 85 83 149 36 10 131 84 18 101	I quite enjoy a good firework show.
101	120 208 100 148 147 47 39 155 82 166 101	Jellyfish are dangerous.
101	198 195 98 121 73 68 48 40 82 168 101	I think it would be hard to survive living here 365 days a year.
101	16 17 65 209 75 71 90 159 37 189 101	The green shirts were a good choice. Everyone knows they work for the hockey rink.
101	183 214 96 190 5 75 125 107 2 94 101	Tombs help us to remember
101	79 17 140 125 81 59 38 184 89 156 101	These flowers are going to go to various places.
101	12 137 124 33 32 109 201 72 155 23 101	these flowers look beautiful
101	201 73 100 96 14 115 65 117 215 205 101	Climbing that would not be an easy feat.
101	21 186 51 39 117 84 53 95 121 41 101	This person is giving a speech
101	100 175 83 19 15 146 115 92 89 125 101	What a beautiful friendship between a human and a cat.
101	46 63 203 180 61 60 143 161 27 94 101	This flower has bloomed but not fully, there are still some unbloomed buds.
101	179 81 119 212 210 73 182 32 8 165 101	A small leafy plant is growing and leans toward the daylight.
101	91 189 50 178 59 173 176 65 41 167 101	A phone for each family member.
101	100 36 125 141 93 210 18 46 8 185 101	There is a perfectly good reason for chewing food utensils.
101	194 109 82 139 48 191 43 105 27 16 101	It is late in the day since the sun is setting
101	41 144 119 97 123 32 133 179 53 92 101	The man in the picture is probably the man standing behind them.
101	103 111 206 100 159 48 190 114 8 91 101	The photographer should have used a flash.
101	79 37 23 58 81 159 109 176 6 77 101	That is a fairly elegant monument.
101	185 165 121 59 44 145 29 20 73 152 101	It's not everyday that you can see a legend on the field.
101	3 118 89 4 18 168 183 153 39 35 101	The trailer is there to provide shade and a resting place for the construction workers.
101	190 155 89 118 61 40 158 27 58 209 101	Okay, we have to be diplomatic here.
101	115 43 160 28 22 140 193 87 104 94 101	Some people like it, others don't.
101	179 49 104 116 92 16 159 71 80 206 101	I going to leave now before the snow on the road begins to ice over.
101	33 163 1 130 98 100 92 63 84 25 101	The daisy is one of the most common flowers in this country
101	13 149 75 210 52 111 123 109 29 55 101	The dome allows for perfect airflow and sun penetration.
101	54 58 82 160 150 183 89 42 192 122 101	Little girl appreciating waterfall
101	47 161 36 121 108 184 115 1 48 82 101	That tiny roof over the wall painting will not do much against the decomposing effects that light has.
101	164 31 199 28 30 49 138 68 208 107 101	There is not a pot of gold at the end of that rainbow.
101	212 30 28 122 178 87 186 96 156 45 101	blue makes me feel good, it could be worse.
101	203 66 56 3 157 140 18 129 110 175 101	This looks like an out door movie theatre, of some sort.
101	194 195 86 44 103 137 170 48 88 57 101	Such a cute dinosaur ride for all the little children. I bet they will have a great time riding.
101	150 173 59 95 42 2 49 205 47 196 101	Wearing a helmet is the right thing to do in that situation.
101	66 122 45 94 47 206 50 170 104 132 101	I don't think he can lift that chair while sitting in it.
101	120 102 16 151 82 170 111 182 81 174 101	It's all about the production values.
101	76 110 114 18 199 57 20 26 93 120 101	this building looks old
101	48 158 64 119 145 22 77 207 52 214 101	The bird is a roof.
101	95 9 76 34 6 185 68 29 104 125 101	The street is very clean and neat. Seems to be a good neighborhood
101	10 84 139 112 99 8 47 153 207 106 101	These people are happy because they are gathered together.
101	158 153 118 203 10 68 209 46 79 167 101	He can't stand for too long playing guitar in a concert,he will need a chair
101	170 172 200 144 180 182 72 151 186 192 101	It's very difficult to capture a good image of these fast vehicles.
101	71 41 1 28 111 165 191 46 141 40 101	That looks quite nice if you're into that kind of stuff.
101	141 109 151 190 174 80 207 131 43 168 101	Looks like you've been training hard mate
101	160 105 110 24 137 194 113 161 73 20 101	If you give a 3 year old a cupcake, you should expect to need to wash her face and clothes afterwards.
101	75 20 82 124 165 153 100 105 54 192 101	The person in blue is dancing.
101	205 39 199 24 188 18 61 120 132 150 101	It only makes sense that they would have a statue of a fish, since that is the countries primary source of food and income.
101	132 126 70 66 172 191 142 149 17 38 101	It would appear to be a small commercial building in a French speaking country.
101	16 163 39 28 171 162 107 158 58 36 101	Old buildings lose their structural integrity over time, and amy need repairs
101	117 189 128 17 170 156 35 84 199 50 101	Need a coat of paint, don't you thnk?
101	206 22 67 126 154 51 213 176 214 212 101	She is going to get cold later on.
101	88 85 2 53 119 31 212 34 121 33 101	Not a real person
101	62 121 69 152 149 166 26 168 23 162 101	This is a really steep beach.
101	195 3 123 169 152 103 68 93 36 141 101	They want to touch it becuase the texture looks so interesting.
101	113 17 90 7 21 93 61 26 49 100 101	Those are gummy candies.
101	160 109 52 204 87 53 27 105 111 50 101	This is a very large farm
101	195 112 157 176 104 177 107 119 132 173 101	looks like a good play is going on
101	30 96 126 55 125 169 161 214 58 68 101	looks like a great place to leave laundry to dry
101	175 31 92 21 202 203 69 178 65 2 101	The brain on the left is big.
101	143 129 74 139 45 56 147 1 194 211 101	The tower depicted in this photo is a skyscraper.
101	212 184 114 33 25 29 97 35 127 46 101	That's a very illogical pose.
101	191 160 5 186 112 88 72 210 113 117 101	Life is like a highway
101	188 79 211 125 25 15 138 209 91 3 101	How amazing is the world, everyone can communicate.
101	123 157 43 111 178 175 179 26 146 46 101	It must be cold there.
101	152 173 71 134 126 2 70 82 193 29 101	This guy doesn't look happy, I wouldn't want to be on his bad side.
101	14 95 180 174 51 140 131 23 203 136 101	There is something missing in this picture.
101	94 131 100 122 116 78 81 134 167 181 101	that is not possible without a flattened edge
101	13 25 148 124 51 136 123 207 36 54 101	The lights are bright up ahead.
101	112 131 5 128 209 50 41 170 45 51 101	The lens on the camera was unable to capture the motion.
101	97 52 130 11 214 205 33 125 138 41 101	They could clean that a little better
101	7 213 172 81 161 170 32 128 3 150 101	This is a perfect way to recycle.   Bird feed.
101	11 130 155 214 113 96 92 110 115 108 101	These rapids look dangerous.
101	42 177 90 171 51 140 25 123 120 169 101	If you sleep with dogs you might get fleas.
101	212 209 113 50 182 122 116 125 80 17 101	That is foreign writing.
101	203 19 37 212 93 215 34 179 92 22 101	They are getting their feet wet.
101	52 111 139 57 188 54 145 20 110 48 101	That baby is not a baseball player.
101	205 112 108 173 99 39 16 28 138 36 101	looks to be going fairly quickly with that wake
101	108 70 159 143 113 68 182 57 92 56 101	This city needs to use its resources wisely.  There are too many people counting on them.
101	196 45 9 212 142 87 133 54 7 186 101	People should not be swimming in those water conditions.
101	174 124 209 170 97 214 10 179 39 115 101	This will be worth a lot of money one day.
101	22 215 43 142 192 117 87 13 170 171 101	He should make the shot as he was wide open.
101	128 102 92 69 88 133 37 65 116 215 101	She must be part of a art piece.
101	157 40 138 129 206 182 79 172 63 19 101	This is a very old structure.
101	22 32 145 7 133 58 188 153 203 25 101	So we need to cut the pie in smaller slices, they are too many of us!
101	65 205 116 9 168 151 63 131 158 107 101	That bird travels long distances.
101	51 42 21 69 151 153 145 11 24 174 101	The architecture is simplistic but effective
101	147 161 114 6 180 184 25 29 47 198 101	Those numbers don't add up properly
101	213 193 145 123 211 200 20 42 66 155 101	These folks seems to be a ballgame - I am not sure what the game is however.
101	78 192 74 62 83 166 37 50 68 147 101	This white bangle tiger is one of the few left in existence
101	15 6 8 61 198 10 70 205 63 87 101	They are most likely working on a project together, the setting resembles an office.
101	124 73 161 44 110 185 99 184 116 40 101	It looks like summer here.
101	131 49 211 42 163 169 17 179 194 135 101	The water looks cold.  I don't suggest that anyone go in.
101	46 109 42 68 102 31 176 60 87 187 101	Barefoot is better than shoes
101	10 194 192 212 106 34 24 191 199 72 101	This game looks like it could come down to the wire.
101	33 115 20 178 43 158 120 51 94 26 101	This is definitely a beach.
101	16 182 131 62 37 42 31 27 197 64 101	Wind power is such a clean form of energy.
101	77 148 160 117 59 23 121 16 212 195 101	Two good friends.
101	208 174 132 38 211 129 90 30 24 147 101	We better find a different trail around these rocks, for safety.
101	190 6 7 8 26 57 183 214 87 153 101	This food might taste good, but the presentation is not very appealing.
101	159 83 3 42 91 79 171 179 99 85 101	No one could survive out here for days without water.
101	194 201 125 39 49 196 88 55 40 58 101	this is aa luxury car and  also rational life
101	76 205 14 92 112 61 169 145 141 53 101	This is a beautiful picture.  However it looks difficult to access.  The sensible thing is to take the photo from a good, safe, and far distance away.
101	199 50 93 174 44 206 28 86 31 151 101	He looks like he is putting some deep thought into making the right decision.
101	76 198 2 24 106 25 149 214 143 74 101	This will not go faster than walking!
101	10 15 131 24 109 67 183 87 75 63 101	the drummer seems to be playing sensibly
101	122 96 60 13 136 17 179 138 65 109 101	The man speaks the truth.
101	165 205 167 203 20 153 215 92 56 78 101	There seems to be little traffic for a city of this size.
101	139 151 206 32 19 122 126 192 23 93 101	The ocean is very big, and theres probably a good bit of fish in this picture.
101	209 194 201 46 2 193 124 47 196 98 101	i know this should be cleaned off but i quite like it

101	74 91 56 116 188 139 114 7 3 98 101	Choosing black is a sliming choice.
101	99 176 5 212 119 109 120 134 91 14 101	This person is likely on vacation.
101	32 30 181 193 152 109 103 164 209 124 101	This looks like a good idea for preventing damage.
101	202 133 24 171 212 1 117 84 99 120 101	This is our tribal doll
101	49 178 157 3 70 53 61 142 136 160 101	I prefer not lock the god inside a case!
101	149 7 79 46 44 78 206 55 88 168 101	The weather and location both predict that this years carnival will take in more visitors than previous years by at least a 50% margin.
101	212 196 197 27 152 60 145 63 85 189 101	every shrine is special to someone

101	72 26 181 170 110 3 41 20 125 145 101	That is one busy looking pub.
101	103 25 154 94 21 201 37 172 162 135 101	Smiling but not having it
101	167 9 84 35 177 51 52 152 39 26 101	Certain birds bond with humans so well
101	128 8 96 97 84 12 93 79 112 87 101	I think she was not really in the mood for all the attention.
101	78 42 184 112 190 200 37 85 86 73 101	She's probably the maid. That must be why she's dressed like that.
101	207 163 70 109 127 20 161 128 82 32 101	Something tells me this is not going to end well.
101	126 103 129 184 37 132 124 128 117 59 101	I hope they're wearing sunscreen. There is not a cloud in the sky.
101	92 153 96 88 30 147 131 40 25 44 101	We have to wait a while before we take another shot, so we don't get alcohol poisoning.
101	111 3 102 164 163 114 117 38 141 17 101	Not sure these sunglasses would look as good on me.
101	95 69 27 114 42 143 22 62 151 73 101	Nature is everywhere.
101	124 13 131 53 21 170 34 35 147 92 101	You need quite a lot of wind to fly a kite.
101	184 4 197 66 122 203 21 87 190 18 101	It's dangerous to be this high
101	118 114 81 125 54 99 136 173 80 107 101	Hmm....I wonder what kind of arena this is. Arena football perhaps?
101	20 46 137 81 45 16 75 210 2 9 101	Belly dancers must really like their job. I couldn't do i.
101	16 23 69 42 20 4 170 37 140 162 101	if thei is a one week supply and the orders take a week to arrive we need to be ordering atleast 3 weeks worth at a time.
101	169 204 8 109 135 161 41 9 213 15 101	I am so glad he did not wear a tie, it would have ruined that whole casual look he has going on.
101	204 84 91 12 77 35 200 195 173 75 101	Imagine the factory that has to make those.
101	135 61 189 96 6 13 191 109 200 19 101	I do believe I need to google translate that or we may end up somewhere we don't want to be.
101	144 67 61 63 188 58 100 212 52 36 101	The wealthy enjoy life more than the poor. When you're wealthy you're more than likely healthy as well. No doubt about that.
101	91 57 90 176 14 172 165 66 187 96 101	This is a good use of props.
101	142 111 122 43 54 15 174 40 196 195 101	I think I would be friends with these people because I supported Obama and I like cookies.
101	36 168 4 110 1 148 201 126 123 102 101	This project should be finished within the year.

101	182 119 37 45 44 81 207 178 26 28 101	Centrifugal force is likely involved in the mechanics of this ride.
101	15 29 203 147 199 208 95 178 190 44 101	It must be someone's birthday.
101	123 146 134 200 125 175 83 77 79 4 101	These seem to be giveaways for an event.
102	92 97 191 84 4 152 171 16 51 17 102	If I were her I would go down the slide.
102	42 155 24 210 81 137 70 33 199 110 102	Is this Neptuna?
102	128 80 72 79 32 113 177 186 160 44 102	We should take that out and just eat it now.
102	164 144 209 152 43 149 83 74 29 120 102	I need to go swim here!
102	130 168 125 11 74 215 116 184 60 199 102	I hope he catches the bad people!

102	90 85 8 199 6 88 178 106 136 35 102	I bet this is a jam session, no music being followed.
102	184 162 157 118 165 103 200 143 206 152 102	I love taking a trip to local stores for no reason at all.
102	167 176 2 12 106 29 13 141 212 17 102	I think I'd like to take that apple core and toss it at the nearest ne'er do well.

102	30 156 140 199 133 129 137 83 151 110 102	It is very out of character to find a different seat
102	175 107 127 193 47 99 2 139 88 120 102	We picked up books at the last minute
102	73 62 45 78 159 110 77 44 71 37 102	The men found the job last minute
102	198 79 164 46 37 132 195 78 109 107 102	Time to skinny dip
102	138 30 148 167 93 142 96 200 76 54 102	Then I ran to the water and met the waves

102	183 111 146 130 34 64 18 33 11 50 102	I love discovering places like this during vacations. Don't make a plan, just decide where to eat on the fly. That's the way to do it.
102	195 129 66 32 212 150 22 155 138 90 102	The road looks really nice and with a lot of life.

102	204 107 208 78 137 48 53 66 140 108 102	I decided to take a road trip to the beach today instead of going to work.

102	17 61 97 201 145 189 98 173 26 171 102	This color would look better if someone grabbed some paint and painted over it.

102	146 158 150 141 194 114 175 58 192 121 102	LET'S GO FLY AROUND THE WORLD
102	113 64 158 110 165 137 50 23 8 46 102	We can scream now and listen the echo
102	44 186 63 211 48 172 209 194 105 141 102	Are those leaves? Lets make a pile and jump in them
102	57 20 169 40 132 87 122 25 187 52 102	I would love to try one of these fitness test events
102	168 209 41 118 20 196 29 155 174 85 102	What a boring and stupid color! The color blood red is better!
102	188 85 43 58 201 41 199 152 6 51 102	Very rarely I wake up early enough to see the sunrise.
102	128 129 208 149 20 9 173 64 132 164 102	It is cool enough, I can drink it and be okay.
102	155 39 74 154 11 187 89 83 140 90 102	These streets are begging for her to jay walk.
102	108 34 60 192 104 48 61 16 160 106 102	Just keep kicking and kicking no matter what!
102	17 76 165 141 174 31 204 71 163 167 102	I'd love to smash through that window and grab some books!
102	23 119 33 19 74 113 128 48 151 86 102	I want to slide down that bannister
102	94 14 57 138 52 65 205 97 189 175 102	Quick! Sit him on Santa's lap!
102	48 122 146 192 108 37 114 156 129 32 102	Who wants to play with the ball?
102	66 14 38 93 169 166 118 4 36 11 102	I wonder what would happen if someone jumped into the water?
102	89 183 35 137 23 91 214 113 65 25 102	Dude lets go climb that wall and jump in that building!
102	169 39 110 195 176 98 88 175 114 79 102	Ever wonder how much bread the average person eats? I do.
102	21 134 206 13 50 174 109 91 194 142 102	I wonder how many people live in there.
102	136 160 197 112 154 200 84 149 174 206 102	I want to jump in that water!
102	175 141 191 156 3 214 177 53 88 100 102	I need to give him a haircut now.
102	209 83 17 59 82 24 138 45 163 35 102	I want that dress.

102	38 132 163 79 6 181 144 51 201 12 102	One of these days, I'm gonna hop on a boat like that and just sail of for a few months.
102	103 108 9 165 30 28 98 52 4 159 102	Lets dance in the snow!
102	127 129 96 207 74 205 95 119 53 134 102	The star shaped hashbrowns have inspired me to make a dessert that is red, white, and blue.
102	67 24 7 53 83 31 89 56 157 91 102	Rock climbing this would be great.
102	94 196 123 19 193 138 8 171 180 10 102	I bet that little dog would be up for going on a long walk right this second!
102	129 148 173 99 160 13 212 196 117 143 102	I think I will head to this place next week.
102	5 161 30 75 52 191 210 72 97 178 102	I'd pick up the knife and throw it.
102	50 144 194 120 4 151 176 89 196 192 102	Everything with this color belongs in a Museum.
102	180 22 41 23 21 192 128 203 36 17 102	Hey! look at me in the back!

102	69 132 210 182 49 189 209 50 130 112 102	Oh wow, a balcony!  I would love to relax on that awesome balcony - think we can?
102	155 131 115 207 198 151 149 41 19 126 102	This gives me life, definitely first on my bucket list!
102	71 162 78 100 73 40 134 106 115 31 102	What are they doing? Whatever it is, I wanna go do it right this second.
102	188 65 83 47 159 204 118 151 17 172 102	So many unseen events can take place within the city just in one night.
102	184 118 200 7 198 178 109 126 154 155 102	Let's make snow angels.
102	112 61 129 151 209 193 149 41 55 105 102	Beautiful girl going on

102	186 183 208 99 161 137 189 176 70 100 102	Rose always makes the strangest faces at the oddest moment.
102	118 98 80 203 11 88 93 50 97 134 102	I think I'll spin around and drink whatever my finger lands on.
102	36 164 148 167 170 202 43 54 31 204 102	I want to howl at that moon.
102	72 21 169 41 123 73 187 148 116 200 102	I signed up to join this today, even though I've never driven one.
102	131 192 164 65 77 72 93 58 116 42 102	they are standing in very spontaneously
102	204 140 57 185 18 172 190 8 130 123 102	I would only jump off this if you asked me too.
102	65 179 113 208 79 137 117 191 63 42 102	What is the quickest way to get to this map?
102	208 83 90 17 188 80 189 2 116 178 102	I bet after this they just went and did someone fun together!
102	99 171 199 183 100 17 144 165 106 212 102	Eric Mar gets my vote.  I love rent control.
102	46 47 29 49 161 76 212 112 22 200 102	lets just jump onto that train and get out of here
102	167 166 55 131 45 40 108 28 14 178 102	Let's get coffee!
102	198 190 156 45 37 16 192 164 80 13 102	Wow, I suddenly have the urge to go outside.
102	194 16 119 77 180 152 145 183 137 123 102	Dots moving in changing patterns. Like life. Like feeling.

102	22 60 161 205 39 108 9 96 61 98 102	Jump from rock to rock would be fun!
102	166 94 164 2 51 65 71 138 63 77 102	Kids will never plan their life until they are matured!
102	178 183 151 98 55 22 143 104 161 54 102	They will get married soon.
102	96 190 33 125 162 44 115 29 117 66 102	Walk on the tall side and make it happen!
102	130 176 38 25 126 132 137 121 89 205 102	Wow, check him out almost looks like he's swinging a baseball bat!
102	142 85 65 90 13 55 95 133 154 15 102	John was never into running, but when he heard about the competition to fund diabetes research he ran like never before.
102	87 135 73 204 89 205 86 50 53 164 102	Wow let's drop in for a visit.

102	213 47 2 26 33 195 90 18 114 196 102	I would have the urge to fix that logo so bad.
102	117 162 74 105 17 16 110 47 20 190 102	I bet I could race the black car with the yellow car and win. I feel like racing.
102	146 23 15 201 95 80 186 175 39 22 102	The water looks choppy and dangerous with all those big rocks but I'd love to swim in it.
102	113 162 138 11 175 32 131 71 181 145 102	I would definitely be headwalking if I was at that concert.
102	56 192 61 187 60 36 58 69 176 198 102	This could form and spread anywhere on the lot.
102	64 186 165 6 149 16 115 130 212 176 102	I have no idea what this is, but I would lovve to jump off of it into the ocean!

102	187 165 48 76 79 162 143 62 88 150 102	I can't believe I was able to start this riot out of nowhere.
102	77 112 29 73 131 103 82 87 205 186 102	Watch out, it's Frankengirl!
102	42 171 76 84 62 208 118 60 14 1 102	What an amazing adventure it would be to travel to this picture and climb that mountain!
102	27 158 74 209 201 175 100 50 33 173 102	Oh my! is that flower dead? Someone call a flower ambulance!

103	98 21 131 2 207 176 5 156 37 29 103	Just looking at that tree makes me want to climb it.  In fact, I need to find that tree just so I can climb it.
103	127 111 178 155 113 138 55 120 38 88 103	I need to be there like right now.

103	91 163 209 181 20 61 172 121 157 165 103	All of these people are in an intense search of Aladdin's lamp.
103	1 93 158 211 57 131 24 139 66 68 103	The woman was compulsive to choose outfits
103	57 145 168 98 17 82 183 16 206 159 103	The way he smiles into the camera makes my heart want to burst!

103	178 144 139 142 183 77 180 10 153 138 103	Those bottles should be centered.
103	95 53 106 86 100 201 139 177 61 12 103	That plane is going entirely too fast for a landing, I'm sure the people inside are scared. And why is one window missing on the side?
103	211 206 76 3 84 94 52 93 69 61 103	They are very strange, I wouldn't go here!
103	45 5 90 127 151 105 131 87 134 186 103	I keep trying to count the number of bricks, but keep losing track! Frustrating, but I can't give up.

103	205 59 191 143 8 135 152 114 34 73 103	That place needs a cleaning.
103	134 50 86 145 162 2 116 66 60 46 103	The pavement could be a little more even looking, I mean you went to the trouble to shine the car.
103	130 29 19 62 184 76 6 16 110 10 103	He should get contacts, too dorky.
103	201 96 92 137 87 119 144 196 188 112 103	He shouldn't hold the book like that, it will rip!
103	179 197 10 190 21 85 119 64 33 79 103	This is a convention and I am so jealous of everyone who got to go, I'd love to be there!

103	105 104 151 33 44 45 29 208 21 213 103	I wouldn't go here unless the trees were trimmed.
103	181 124 150 59 213 129 154 36 208 20 103	I love running! It's my favorite activity. I run all the time, sometimes four hours a day. Running is great.
103	186 168 182 113 7 198 58 191 95 209 103	I want to study art like this every single day.
103	192 43 129 195 64 5 184 72 20 143 103	That guy's face must be a sign that he's not enjoying the convo... could be better probably
103	151 164 19 115 52 140 44 68 173 129 103	Too many people
103	178 146 159 82 204 49 148 170 144 110 103	These people need to get off the phone!
103	108 57 65 3 18 136 111 119 135 200 103	The exhibit was the most exhilarating I have been to in my entire life.

103	204 184 9 189 114 212 129 54 102 62 103	This would go perfectly with my table arrangement.
103	137 18 88 147 177 75 144 120 76 151 103	This is so nice I have to know what kind of plant this is omg

103	41 91 61 99 205 49 107 47 186 122 103	I wonder how many people are in this picture. That's a lot of people.
103	204 20 171 113 84 158 62 14 165 136 103	I find the photo just a little too tightly cropped for my taste, I would have zoomed out more, obeying the "rule of thirds".
103	75 3 85 62 13 39 6 108 86 1 103	I cant stop thinking about how good that must be.
103	193 76 100 180 35 48 161 117 111 138 103	I wonder what kind of plant that is let me look it up.

103	168 117 57 171 8 195 59 62 188 93 103	Where is this!! I MUST GO THERE NOW!
103	150 142 22 81 202 85 66 208 96 186 103	Where is this? TELL ME NOW, I NEED TO KNOW!

103	115 192 149 76 86 212 154 136 167 169 103	That place looks very germ-filled. I would need a plastic bubble to go inside there!
103	180 86 200 136 189 102 7 152 28 45 103	PLEASE move that rake. I don't understand why people don't bother to put things away. It isn't cute.

103	86 57 75 102 29 147 11 153 123 156 103	Why doesn't that guys badge match everyone elses.  It's just not right.  Someone should fix it.  Is there someone we can call.  Seriously.
103	9 135 140 205 187 35 125 97 77 91 103	I can't stop thinking about this little green frog and the life he must live out there! You think he's hungry? I bet he's hungry! And scared! and lonely! and tired! Oh I bet he tired! We must save him!
103	70 33 75 69 172 206 165 129 118 32 103	There are exactly 287 people there
103	188 78 86 214 69 76 199 47 144 68 103	I can't get the barbed wire out of my head.
103	28 25 33 177 147 154 115 82 173 76 103	Is that kid three months old? Six months? I have to know!
103	137 15 130 40 141 29 206 30 14 17 103	I can't tell if he has his helmet buckled. Safety is vitally important. Please buckle all safety equipment!
103	114 68 211 49 16 84 2 107 38 21 103	I go here all the time, can't get away from it!
103	4 8 187 34 60 163 136 142 199 170 103	That guy seems like he owns that woman
103	47 1 27 113 57 11 184 110 177 70 103	That fan looks like mine , give it back
103	109 198 204 170 195 145 194 121 147 181 103	I totally love mountain views and this one is awesome.
103	81 68 205 88 86 10 13 15 58 105 103	I can't stop thinking about that orange cone. It'll be on my mind all night.
103	120 43 82 35 29 175 142 149 4 15 103	What an excellent array of blues in this picture!
103	95 180 207 116 137 73 136 215 105 70 103	Where is this, that they paint their stairs to match their buildings, I must know.
103	80 3 187 75 36 169 179 61 167 117 103	I am going to fix every patch of grass.
103	133 60 176 196 185 125 11 51 34 151 103	I hate when the sun shines in my eyes, we should geoengineer more clouds.
103	120 113 133 128 39 203 65 173 51 166 103	I want to count the number of bricks.
104	202 211 122 17 126 142 67 35 160 191 104	I admire anyone who goes and climbs that.
104	94 173 150 155 189 38 181 126 31 142 104	Aww bummer your image didn't load
104	166 208 45 26 157 100 31 71 51 84 104	I feel sorry for the animals.
104	154 49 79 106 183 69 77 184 208 143 104	I hope everyone had a great time.
104	78 23 168 28 150 47 195 30 212 187 104	I bet this was super fun.
104	204 143 77 1 12 206 192 24 172 120 104	I love the M in yout name.
104	160 164 25 30 138 162 154 168 179 110 104	I was once a confused, talent-less young photographer as well. Don't worry lad! The eye develops with time.
104	124 165 110 145 155 102 152 45 75 12 104	Oh, to be a child again, not a care in the world.
104	74 173 181 140 90 68 137 126 28 99 104	What beauty nature delivers, I feel for the animals taken for pleasure.
104	95 36 112 205 130 135 148 60 208 138 104	I really feel for the people who have to clean up after this event.
104	159 36 175 61 2 58 147 114 72 146 104	I sypathize with the singers
104	174 103 46 164 24 179 187 120 159 183 104	they look very empathetic
104	3 114 88 32 212 34 186 105 39 58 104	skyline of a small town
104	64 80 139 38 156 192 70 202 27 13 104	Oh no I hope he does not trip
104	78 47 165 106 12 148 131 114 63 214 104	Don't you feel sorry for the poor chicken who had to die for this meal?
104	183 169 35 211 105 47 127 111 143 173 104	Aw, look at how cute those cats! I bet she's such a good mother to her cubs.
104	182 105 108 59 67 27 204 111 60 200 104	Thats a cool device. Cool pic.
104	5 202 124 30 10 186 146 58 131 3 104	Athletic competition is hard work.
104	77 13 103 100 192 201 158 33 153 105 104	Every child's soul begins as a flower.
104	43 16 156 69 137 70 60 210 150 191 104	Seems like darkness is slowly creeping.
104	66 160 24 10 199 62 202 203 209 211 104	Ahh the Wagner 200, those were the days when Operas were decent.
104	82 80 1 123 74 209 83 18 140 4 104	I know how it feels carrying the burden of responsibility
104	180 206 55 22 140 30 95 38 9 109 104	sensitive, sympathetic, merciful
104	195 210 145 23 28 40 187 183 198 150 104	I would love to drive this car
104	15 35 182 13 144 180 125 102 155 97 104	I'm glad he's finding ways to have fun while wearing glasses after his eye surgery.
104	144 48 131 136 39 142 32 50 150 24 104	That poor li'l lizard. The brick dust on its paws is such a painful, toxic environment. i can see the pain in its eyes.
104	161 81 191 71 154 176 181 179 163 26 104	I hope he's careful! He's so high up
104	189 9 14 24 34 199 158 108 21 164 104	Sorry nothing is on sale
104	15 92 143 70 14 29 178 58 109 138 104	I think that girl messed up during the third act, I feel bad.
104	205 132 21 197 187 115 206 183 107 165 104	These flowers need water, i'd give them food too.
104	1 21 96 211 97 151 74 79 39 157 104	He did a great job.
104	71 63 106 114 112 19 175 188 36 121 104	The poor bloke on the bottom!
104	208 32 78 79 107 26 171 88 175 201 104	He looks quite lost, hope he finds some friends.
104	200 168 188 125 86 136 100 72 199 181 104	This looks like a good meal, hope you enjoy it!
104	165 192 9 169 44 25 155 12 188 139 104	Ripe fruit on the tree, just in time for picking.
104	135 62 8 41 119 32 73 153 75 90 104	That poor person feels left out.
104	4 102 101 51 207 201 161 182 43 26 104	What beautiful lands, it seems there's a drought though.
104	13 151 171 82 184 86 5 4 36 103 104	I can't believe he was able to comeback from poverty to achieve his dreams as an artist.
104	8 195 186 141 52 83 126 47 17 97 104	This is a beautiful beach, hopefully the birds are well fed.
104	85 100 81 44 62 79 77 139 126 185 104	This poor forest had its trees cut. I bet it is sad :(
104	76 158 194 183 54 35 97 17 14 156 104	I pity the schoolchildren who have to eat this for lunch.
104	192 7 158 98 35 179 146 15 2 207 104	Those poor birds look so hungry!
104	213 134 54 156 157 88 84 144 101 149 104	What lovely flowers, hope he doesn't have allergies like me.
104	131 183 107 66 154 108 68 111 40 212 104	Birds probably hungry, hopefully he finds food.
104	71 151 214 7 153 120 95 42 191 105 104	I hope that beautiful bird catches its dinner. It looks hungry!
104	170 160 3 124 140 122 9 191 61 214 104	I really feel like I understand what the architect was trying to achieve!
104	163 61 146 168 93 18 70 55 13 36 104	The view can be seen from all around
104	41 55 9 83 71 46 32 14 130 79 104	I'm sure you are so excited to see the clock tower. I'm excited for you!
104	42 161 133 52 36 71 63 81 164 54 104	ugh, I've been there before...having to DJ and no one is dancing..
104	202 144 29 198 23 208 79 116 141 158 104	I can really sympathise with people who have faith.
104	202 39 89 78 42 211 184 67 73 69 104	grass is dying I feel bad for them
104	92 111 87 102 180 103 147 193 94 70 104	The view looks nice
104	123 122 37 73 140 187 62 22 130 94 104	this room looks rather dimly lit. what is going on?
104	85 49 71 53 59 25 136 108 43 89 104	That yellow really makes me feel vibrant and beautiful.
104	74 10 31 48 107 176 185 102 98 66 104	I pray that humanity will protect places like these.
104	74 23 62 9 156 51 128 82 102 70 104	I think these people should be allowed to eat while listening. It might get tiring to sit there for a long time.
104	95 127 197 2 186 105 129 173 188 36 104	These swans look so peaceful, I would love to have their life.
104	42 32 46 18 77 209 170 176 199 39 104	Sweet little bird! I hope he feels better soon.
104	49 144 70 39 80 165 177 101 105 110 104	Cinderellas castle is one of the most amazing sights. Disney World is one of the most popular places for sick children to request to go with MakeaWish
104	117 70 138 116 130 93 30 167 77 67 104	The person who created this must have spent so much time perfecting it! Well done!
104	73 30 24 28 39 188 149 23 27 123 104	It must be a continual worry living right on top of a canal. Rather them than me!
104	180 80 36 173 212 191 109 13 6 49 104	This looks lovely
104	166 106 175 7 114 56 185 209 74 201 104	It looks really hot out. Next week I am going out to the town square to hand out water.
104	60 139 64 91 158 192 38 87 52 157 104	That woman is a good citizen to the people.
104	147 72 84 22 61 9 204 133 189 143 104	I can't believe those performers have to be so scantily clad. I'm sure their act would be just as good if they were allowed to wear clothes. I hope they have full say over what they can wear.
104	47 22 50 187 126 182 136 118 183 123 104	I can understand why no one is outside right now.
104	49 185 155 37 141 147 187 130 50 174 104	oof. It's got to be hard to run a business in a construction zone.
104	14 38 101 122 81 93 106 215 206 33 104	So many people worked to make this railroad. Their communities must be so proud.
104	78 209 59 118 121 31 115 34 28 195 104	Poor people the weather on this beach is so bad...
104	156 10 68 202 37 87 150 151 200 126 104	i am sorry for your loss
104	39 49 184 199 118 41 84 29 201 19 104	I used to have two dogs like that, I was really happy.
104	119 205 177 34 42 97 60 37 214 50 104	I truly feel that this beautiful butterfly is feeling totally at peace on the plant.
104	159 12 85 122 133 154 68 56 93 83 104	I have more change than most I guess.
104	114 116 172 65 62 76 123 134 162 14 104	I've worn see through stuff before.
104	34 174 95 186 150 183 134 130 198 127 104	It makes me wonder what all of the people who pass under that arch do in life.
104	79 126 112 43 10 214 51 185 52 111 104	I let someone have my ticket for this train because they didn't not have enough money.
104	176 34 19 102 166 23 73 40 56 125 104	I feel sorry for that officer.
104	205 164 158 181 85 34 72 48 16 176 104	I hope he hits the ball.
104	60 119 71 100 183 209 6 85 51 64 104	I wish it was not so far away.
104	69 187 182 7 109 37 211 151 57 10 104	We have to protect our environment more.
104	190 51 212 73 158 79 112 45 89 130 104	Getting up and having to perform like that takes courage. I'd definitely support him
104	177 183 124 59 169 195 34 51 199 93 104	The brides family was not happy with the first dance.
104	155 90 73 140 174 75 99 127 170 195 104	I really hope she doesn't tangle her hair with that pose, it's always a pain getting those out.
104	19 123 153 140 189 207 143 180 70 102 104	someone really put a lot of time into creating this gerden. I am glad they they shared this pic to let us see the fruits of their labor
104	118 96 58 68 110 174 194 42 157 40 104	hometown, silent, rapport
104	96 158 106 39 118 78 8 115 19 205 104	looks like you and your son had a fun time!
104	68 77 89 54 63 62 135 204 151 159 104	It makes me hurt to remember the girl who jumped from the top of this building.
104	188 99 26 161 63 61 19 206 72 91 104	I feel for the people who have to grow up in situations like these
104	96 153 145 40 23 183 57 68 76 173 104	This reminds me of those good times with my partner playing together
104	65 195 36 103 88 133 72 170 204 85 104	Everytime I see these beautiful lights it reminds me of my grandma and the time we came here last year. She passed a few months back and seeing this does good for my soul.
104	32 45 197 127 169 116 55 23 179 56 104	I agree that Christmas is life!
104	158 76 60 32 184 122 72 142 173 208 104	I can understand how hard it must to be working at a market like that one.
104	212 90 88 41 179 171 189 186 86 123 104	I can relate to those girls, I had the same age at some point.
104	171 113 155 139 97 98 33 169 93 107 104	wow they look nice
104	79 212 141 155 83 214 73 204 45 128 104	It must be hard finding only white foods to eat.
104	114 119 7 90 1 179 183 102 109 141 104	The ski conditions today have very short sight distance be careful of where your going!
104	2 41 47 134 112 4 133 107 198 135 104	This would be a great place to serve food to people who need it.
104	178 62 205 182 122 170 56 55 1 102 104	more needs to be done to preserve this intricate, and beautiful architecture
104	132 146 49 57 204 45 74 5 105 153 104	You'll have a chance to cross in a moment.
104	179 117 93 65 123 24 33 12 150 35 104	This looks like a beautiful place to live, though it seems very cold!
104	78 179 64 67 111 19 126 83 196 82 104	how lonely, though it is crowded with people
104	151 89 116 184 95 21 186 19 92 109 104	What a relaxing, calming scene.
104	47 156 187 60 54 86 106 44 110 183 104	I know what it feels like to be so devoted to a team. Good luck my friend!
104	163 197 186 155 30 168 32 139 90 158 104	The feel bad for those kids, i'm sure they are tired of playing.
104	208 106 213 74 184 65 179 75 89 26 104	She could break that
104	114 199 98 201 215 190 111 154 90 100 104	Poor runners, probably tired after that heavy running
104	110 1 96 45 25 156 114 107 147 93 104	The Hindu statue appears to bring about great tranquility for this house.
104	80 105 78 34 209 19 39 125 126 73 104	Good society is compassionate and kind for the needy people, please help the ones in need!
104	186 41 68 83 192 39 208 97 75 215 104	I am very sad rockets are still being launched and destroying are ozone layer.
104	55 201 115 16 130 167 141 142 148 64 104	I feel for that person framed in the doorway.
104	186 112 87 46 123 76 18 192 26 171 104	This is the way to start the day!
104	140 34 71 144 108 145 101 182 178 70 104	I hope the plants are not too hot in the sun.
104	180 117 99 204 200 169 160 111 24 88 104	This reminds me of when I was a little girl playing soccer with my friends.
104	82 83 130 18 146 179 190 57 101 183 104	She looks like such a caring mother.
104	188 209 156 50 179 112 136 11 19 113 104	Oh no. Someone forgot their drinks.
104	114 142 151 10 165 132 159 38 50 71 104	I really feel bad for all the locals who have to climb these steps daily must be a real hardship.
104	2 175 98 202 157 117 118 170 19 18 104	They must have put lots of blood sweat and tears into this exhibit, much respect.

105	78 81 50 77 152 80 178 150 212 176 105	This art must have taken a lot of effort.
105	100 213 58 19 175 40 112 143 138 11 105	These gargoyles are real.
105	210 22 54 215 186 87 152 19 102 70 105	There needs to be many more trees.
105	207 201 189 122 138 99 48 68 79 213 105	Whoever grew those clovers to be lush and green like that did a great job.

106	113 170 19 126 214 70 73 164 4 47 106	Looks like typical street scrawlings, indicative of places where children lack expressive activities.
106	118 107 61 93 31 175 148 68 185 10 106	These building show classical architecture for the area.

106	57 165 210 181 188 16 77 200 205 100 106	She looks like a very classy lady
106	39 83 81 190 175 123 30 184 36 110 106	The lust and passion for good tunes will never die.
106	50 65 83 162 71 75 193 137 99 26 106	Looks like a great place to study
106	208 90 205 144 213 148 110 167 62 84 106	Just as the Eral of Badminton meant for the game to be played.
106	117 80 19 115 200 64 90 152 57 18 106	My family and I always dress up for events here.  We have seen the very best perform.
106	27 104 61 35 84 97 192 117 195 94 106	why are they making fun of Seychelles pirates?
106	169 78 36 120 186 64 12 26 74 60 106	This lake recently had a bad case of algae bloom but has since regressed with proper treatment.
106	14 43 97 213 93 89 82 168 44 183 106	Such a barbaric waste of time
106	197 48 14 168 111 117 163 71 61 123 106	This does not follow the rules of photography. Look at how tilted it is and the colors are just not the quality they should be.
106	64 145 177 23 61 54 60 30 111 83 106	The marching band should have better uniforms. What about those jackets with the fringe?
106	72 95 199 192 98 214 16 14 152 38 106	I do believe these are antiques and would make great museum pieces.
106	90 110 121 23 174 185 95 156 151 182 106	I believe these are the leaves of the special Forage Tree only found in remote parts of Brazil.
106	128 200 111 179 15 191 132 14 60 42 106	What exquisite stonework in contrast to the burnt orange.
106	9 126 18 146 51 74 112 4 53 98 106	Dressing up traditionally to express heritage
106	181 119 77 48 118 184 4 101 43 120 106	This is a typical taxicab one would find on High Street in large towns in the United Kingdom.
106	149 214 52 209 173 150 152 72 110 85 106	The symbol on the door was created by John Hughes.
106	36 44 128 2 62 6 20 84 21 197 106	That castle is very proper for the royals
106	179 205 84 136 199 109 159 46 164 25 106	Not my favorite sport.
106	25 202 52 40 17 59 141 36 179 86 106	This person seems hard at work and should be left alone.
106	155 97 108 122 3 6 154 69 49 181 106	I always enjoy visiting cities to get a great view of their skylines.

106	66 193 196 176 164 132 30 81 23 160 106	Fireworks have been used in our celebrations for centuries.
106	64 27 50 156 186 188 68 39 79 116 106	How serene it looks
106	158 24 29 102 157 39 3 53 90 111 106	Two men lies here, graceful and at home..ready to take the world.
106	71 148 209 113 42 6 11 12 130 129 106	I love this band. I have all their albums
107	152 87 109 197 25 97 90 162 30 134 107	I saw a monkey once
107	130 43 99 63 137 6 72 188 151 134 107	I forgot my parachute.
107	64 91 181 134 3 214 136 119 171 114 107	UMM AHH what does this mean?
107	22 121 28 61 195 198 141 75 100 207 107	I don't remember where this is or what that blue stuff is.
107	49 38 69 46 96 194 192 141 152 167 107	This looks like the same shade my white shirt turned when I washed it with my new red hoody :)
107	174 132 195 74 158 129 67 214 190 66 107	Major work to do. I can't even remember when I changed my oil
107	194 109 105 187 72 196 195 156 57 148 107	bartle doo chicken
107	175 194 172 197 57 180 156 9 46 17 107	I honestly don't even know what sport I am looking at.
107	1 63 105 57 144 68 25 21 14 182 107	I know I had a picture like this, now where did I put it?
107	17 194 164 25 207 170 171 5 118 127 107	Oh, I thought it was dollar taco night.
107	114 149 99 69 41 65 169 215 6 34 107	I think the cat has forgotten where it is
107	59 109 70 58 71 23 190 96 48 138 107	I keep forgetting to look at the pretty view
107	117 104 100 79 63 106 48 183 22 21 107	I love watching the train go by every day
107	18 85 119 32 68 126 10 93 87 36 107	I hope that guy finds his wheelbarrow soon.
107	180 131 115 213 136 60 171 123 3 4 107	I like the green on the plate. Green is good for you.
107	30 4 79 133 212 130 22 8 117 152 107	The scribbles on this page make it so hard to concentrate
107	132 52 97 71 157 43 67 77 146 120 107	Where is this place again?
107	172 45 54 204 191 3 42 139 96 92 107	what is the purpose of this picture again?
107	54 60 140 20 213 110 163 184 159 42 107	The woman in pink is so zoned out, she is going fall or bump someone.
107	163 35 13 158 60 69 53 193 207 57 107	His hat reminds me of that movie with the cartoon rat and the chef. I've seen it a million times with my kid, but can't remember the name.
107	212 184 33 96 164 172 197 146 2 147 107	I wonder what has everyone's attention at the bottom? What kind of trees are those?
107	184 175 30 124 41 109 116 148 190 212 107	The boy forgot where he had hid the ball.
107	145 104 190 159 139 56 123 53 181 38 107	This is an alien ship landing.
107	159 46 32 105 17 102 13 43 183 75 107	Wonder what they do here?
107	3 22 61 109 135 70 183 155 169 137 107	I wonder what I will have for dinner?
107	145 139 131 102 83 72 206 96 212 189 107	I've forgotten the ferry schedule and have to wait for the next boat to arrive.
107	118 16 19 92 190 185 213 3 212 142 107	I am trying to remember where I left my cell phone.
107	52 129 63 178 123 190 198 77 16 127 107	What a dull place to be.
107	154 51 43 159 8 132 27 118 119 10 107	Is that the statue of liberty?
107	171 59 39 181 37 197 54 117 105 42 107	I watched this game, but don't even know who won.
107	87 198 33 215 113 110 25 118 89 41 107	I'm not sure what all this wiring is for?
107	35 172 213 41 181 159 163 29 60 208 107	I hope that dog didn't fall after catching that frisbee
107	93 18 89 118 3 197 120 75 153 171 107	I wonder where that swimsuit was bought
107	53 67 166 128 200 91 170 185 168 206 107	Crap. I just remembered. I need to fix the leak in my roof before it rains again.
107	215 91 214 120 148 98 74 29 81 102 107	I know what this place is, but I forget what it's called...
107	149 199 181 160 86 101 211 18 129 70 107	Why are people lining up to see a rock?
107	149 136 194 198 29 169 26 176 101 40 107	How dreamy! I could wander up and down a beach like that all day long. Just hope I could find the way back to my car.
107	11 5 199 141 67 81 63 68 168 151 107	I wonder where that is...
107	69 41 143 167 31 182 98 51 145 214 107	I held my finger over the lens when I took this photo.
107	12 146 77 28 38 21 196 150 15 122 107	Oh man where are the people? Did a tornado come through?
107	99 195 30 135 71 65 62 70 84 200 107	I had a tub like that when I was over there.  I always used all my soap up.  Do you remember that soap?
107	99 96 180 175 51 165 87 199 209 159 107	Oh theres a bug he's riding on, what's in the background?
107	54 144 114 146 60 80 3 68 147 56 107	I can never read maps correctly, even those amusement park ones!
107	62 28 160 179 155 91 98 167 76 103 107	This pot is a strange design.
107	56 114 36 96 29 152 49 30 82 131 107	I love the sea. Fish is my favourite food to eat. Anyway, how old is that boat?
107	130 188 113 45 116 46 100 51 172 56 107	I would love to be this kid, just sitting in the sand and randomly doodling to my heart's content all day. That would be the life
107	201 89 196 168 14 151 45 161 36 138 107	I know I put my cell phone on one of these blocks when I was cleaning, but which one?
107	55 129 100 116 181 20 121 158 178 23 107	It's a building
107	189 202 72 104 114 132 178 17 67 35 107	Close your eyes and you see bright yellow!
107	86 176 103 158 127 96 1 66 161 24 107	I can't pay attention to high school sports, even though I want to.
107	32 185 4 53 120 135 6 182 162 46 107	Those are nice dandelions.
107	49 66 21 6 111 61 70 43 126 163 107	I had a bike like that once, but I accidentally left it at the beach.
107	151 157 62 29 126 210 80 50 120 17 107	What's the name for the pointy thing at the top of the building?
107	120 53 111 44 58 204 45 84 176 119 107	What an awesome car i have
107	137 178 56 96 47 91 108 64 78 166 107	I may want to get those CDs, but then again, I'm not sure.
107	91 204 37 119 76 193 200 55 99 53 107	I wonder why he stopped?
107	166 3 29 43 95 164 82 197 202 207 107	Is this like a pizzeria or something?
107	207 113 128 102 112 69 135 44 136 59 107	I remember spacing out in second grade for hours at a time.
107	127 215 186 17 32 55 162 40 166 43 107	Interesting art. Didn't make me think of much, but I enjoyed the scenery and thought it was cool.
107	206 40 105 165 81 179 123 101 74 131 107	I forget which way to go.
107	200 193 50 62 67 137 154 205 135 60 107	a lot of cactus in it
107	98 4 145 83 193 158 142 86 49 204 107	where are my keys
107	168 7 102 95 62 22 179 77 97 144 107	What lovely weather
107	120 197 205 54 170 72 215 184 91 134 107	I should be watching baseball
107	197 17 123 114 67 121 87 11 19 36 107	What am I doing here?
107	133 91 69 149 100 47 71 132 159 74 107	Is that a fish or a squid?
107	126 202 152 106 109 158 9 46 30 204 107	The dog should close his eyes.
107	82 129 31 126 125 56 97 171 177 45 107	Someone should untangle the mess.
107	135 9 185 28 31 6 145 82 146 95 107	Wonder what they are looking at
107	194 144 54 136 49 85 73 77 187 87 107	What is this a part of a bike
107	132 40 60 176 193 46 138 121 75 14 107	I think the woman is a little too aloof to be riding a motorcycle.
107	178 169 85 210 45 44 47 80 24 195 107	What a beautiful view? Where are we again?
107	213 23 137 40 131 59 153 69 35 92 107	I don't remember what the kids are looking at.
107	116 4 124 84 196 27 67 72 9 191 107	I want waffles, where should i go?
107	197 85 77 55 9 56 24 135 18 161 107	ooh i thought we were going to the mall
107	93 25 137 149 156 38 10 145 176 101 107	Why is the building broken like that
107	166 127 160 73 26 88 99 174 32 194 107	Oh, I forgot to water the plants!
107	72 4 67 136 65 157 46 142 51 80 107	If this were me I would've forgotten to tie the boat to the pier.
107	9 152 35 51 5 86 90 158 128 136 107	I wonder if they are playing dress up.
107	119 207 29 1 139 68 184 59 114 12 107	Groot, where did I put my weapons?
107	75 121 200 115 161 14 149 203 34 195 107	Did I plant these, or were they already here?
107	152 120 57 21 213 93 129 52 185 71 107	Those are some nice boots, I mean slippers, I mean shoes.
107	150 134 98 76 151 87 94 204 26 212 107	Is this a florida beach?
107	179 36 153 210 211 43 101 58 182 191 107	is that blue
107	177 162 145 9 195 3 111 196 191 67 107	Pretty boring speach.
107	106 26 74 37 49 212 186 12 24 199 107	Oh, I just remembered I left the water faucet on!
107	118 134 202 169 164 153 162 57 159 93 107	Why is she pointing at the whatchamacallit?
107	73 42 69 100 146 37 75 29 177 122 107	These tigers are really big and that's a nice watterfall and...what were we talking about?  Oh right tigers! Yeah I like tigers.
107	145 33 163 146 9 126 86 165 161 164 107	They are in a City
107	56 203 108 49 76 28 5 135 157 126 107	This looks like a fun family... did I leave my oven on again?
107	199 127 176 20 45 147 57 111 183 98 107	nice looking town. I would like to visit there
107	60 186 198 167 188 129 20 116 69 191 107	I should have practiced the mud luge before starting me tri-atholn goals.
107	53 66 56 163 190 61 103 134 37 21 107	The lion reminds me of the circus.
107	120 52 180 95 151 21 67 53 18 79 107	I can't remember the song
107	215 176 74 178 177 117 39 198 47 95 107	She looks freaked out
107	214 156 86 197 18 54 109 198 80 52 107	Is this like a painting?
107	155 150 65 17 128 182 32 199 12 103 107	Are like these doctors?
107	40 164 80 83 23 19 94 14 118 82 107	Enjoying a lazy day driving along the river.
107	128 6 169 3 147 184 65 85 130 100 107	What are the circles supposed to be?
107	98 40 68 70 152 95 185 27 104 138 107	Sure, sure, it's a car driving down a street. I see this daily.
107	96 82 54 23 137 184 70 43 80 126 107	That baby is kinda creepy.
107	174 99 142 154 193 109 45 75 180 76 107	A lamp I guess
107	213 181 110 112 95 197 73 31 53 97 107	I completely forgot to put out the bread. What a waste.
107	126 26 15 67 85 52 75 194 24 58 107	I used to play that kind of instrument but I can't think what it's called.
107	172 168 205 117 48 196 31 142 207 191 107	Is this like a pair of sunglasses?
107	43 103 156 58 19 150 135 44 54 173 107	Seems like a relaxing job.
107	159 141 1 150 102 151 48 202 205 177 107	One time I was at his concert then I realized I left my wallet at home. Too bad as I wanted to get merch from the show.
107	210 86 61 121 52 106 79 146 119 205 107	Bring me some too, i want to feel high
107	31 114 199 141 4 131 83 105 35 109 107	What am I looking at again>
107	9 177 93 196 135 169 48 179 14 163 107	I wonder how often people fall into the water
107	154 89 92 83 88 192 169 138 44 147 107	Huh? What is this a type of mushroom? I'm not good at guessing these types of things.
107	34 123 208 95 124 64 148 32 93 72 107	So im pretty sure this is a stage play.
107	108 21 61 173 91 143 154 119 160 128 107	Too bad this isn't written in English.
107	178 80 189 86 182 54 64 91 49 185 107	This is what i walk by every day.
107	21 141 152 98 183 93 160 95 120 73 107	This looks like a place I went to once but can't remember where it was.
107	125 29 192 190 174 79 109 36 184 92 107	The stained glass really keeps a lot of the light out.
107	37 201 140 192 34 54 175 114 169 152 107	I hope they are careful with that dog.
107	94 100 170 188 138 45 62 23 39 186 107	I don't get it. It's just a color.
107	125 123 205 200 108 11 120 78 101 23 107	I could jump that.
107	41 136 183 38 92 26 111 102 209 172 107	Hard to focus on a single thing here.. my eyes keep wandering this crazy crowded city
107	133 65 13 31 43 158 176 119 63 145 107	I want a drink of what's in that cup.
107	128 99 130 88 190 124 76 144 151 215 107	This reminds me of something, but I can't remember what...
107	79 40 106 185 84 155 47 102 78 46 107	Wonder what's in there...
107	96 84 57 43 78 190 16 133 167 113 107	backstreet boys 2.0
107	56 213 102 198 132 106 177 124 178 199 107	I think I left mine at home guys.  Can you wait while I go get it?
107	215 184 191 177 124 53 168 75 71 135 107	Where do lights come from?
107	10 52 47 118 159 194 146 3 189 182 107	I really have no idea what we are looking at.
107	130 71 210 204 85 156 179 44 155 69 107	She looks cool with that pow- wait, never mind I forgot what I was going to say.
107	199 84 35 179 103 124 209 72 177 63 107	Why is she wearing that weird outfit?
107	193 103 152 14 166 85 145 110 94 113 107	Is that a boat? Looks old.
107	11 15 176 56 133 18 14 64 211 42 107	A construction site? Or is it a settlement scheme?
107	162 197 167 67 35 84 196 161 76 181 107	A bell in the sunset...it must be past dinnertime.
107	50 6 61 45 54 144 68 51 148 44 107	I'd probably try to buy that shirt, but there's no way that I'll remember to do that.
107	174 3 121 106 44 201 105 15 41 90 107	Was this picture taken in summer?
107	19 59 104 192 49 17 163 139 132 8 107	i feel she is very confident and not absentiminded
107	176 83 46 36 148 206 173 196 209 191 107	Those buildings look so familiar but there's no way I'm gonna remember that.
107	188 74 25 128 101 173 146 213 43 26 107	it is very clear to point out the place
107	78 49 177 83 32 92 178 52 149 108 107	I think I forgot to put my socks on.
107	112 11 10 76 199 118 23 53 14 177 107	This color seems like once I would forget in a day.
107	203 65 94 120 3 191 12 85 135 8 107	those two guys behind the DJ's seem distracted
107	5 39 78 173 53 144 159 157 109 116 107	I forgot that I was supposed to take notes during the presentation.
107	62 158 16 184 188 156 118 209 145 199 107	i wonder why there are so many photos on the wall
107	31 120 60 40 2 187 201 155 67 36 107	Is this like dusk or dawn or something?
107	214 101 29 97 87 62 159 73 98 96 107	Who is that guy on the left again?
107	47 13 67 195 161 150 22 53 192 199 107	is that bird walking or flying
107	56 215 205 117 195 204 100 61 53 90 107	You can see the layers of the Earth.
107	5 130 140 156 79 70 135 13 125 213 107	Is he like swimming?
107	57 85 149 99 206 158 124 114 160 53 107	Love to just lie out on that plastic and soak up the sun.
107	102 212 124 204 182 183 81 52 23 150 107	She looks like she doesn't understand him.
107	97 206 39 84 9 60 141 4 100 96 107	The people look like their in jail.
107	12 44 76 47 49 155 52 150 113 177 107	What is this, where are they, what is happening
107	202 71 22 152 12 8 18 189 89 88 107	Well that looks neat.
107	161 154 5 109 126 69 18 38 33 151 107	Before I knew it I finished the whole dessert
107	102 48 82 201 79 119 199 45 23 132 107	I know I'm in the middle of the jungle, but did I leave the coffee pot on?
107	203 185 181 61 44 49 213 160 88 178 107	Why is there a window in the way?
107	132 159 14 171 39 131 111 101 189 119 107	i wonder how many people have came here
107	191 214 119 15 172 84 92 7 113 46 107	I wonder where I left my turtleneck; looks like she found hers.
107	77 140 154 96 155 24 114 162 209 26 107	I wonder if there are bees
107	108 99 27 180 53 208 202 34 193 210 107	Thats the Ocean near New York City. Or was it near Australia. Or China.
107	103 20 90 41 7 52 191 102 54 93 107	Wow a cup.
107	112 54 192 127 56 197 166 76 14 170 107	Who is this character supposed to be? I have no idea.
107	89 54 131 210 194 39 168 100 180 147 107	I don't quite get the layers here.
107	106 188 3 203 41 96 26 93 35 140 107	Don't trip on the stone.
107	186 211 205 45 213 118 55 44 13 136 107	The ball looks familiar. I forgot what sport it is used.
107	48 111 153 88 210 176 114 200 13 55 107	Those jeans don't really fit
107	116 48 47 93 54 20 15 185 149 71 107	I wonder what he's looking for
107	72 34 125 111 46 148 62 165 204 95 107	Why is there a hole in the wall?
107	102 41 36 210 143 131 176 31 157 104 107	Looks like a fun place to swim
107	167 199 111 60 43 120 133 84 170 57 107	I like this color a lot
107	35 16 118 208 154 149 67 152 115 87 107	Sorry I forgot the dimensions..
107	130 168 146 143 160 24 127 172 52 48 107	I'm not familiar with K-Pop stars.
107	135 186 118 124 182 21 67 172 184 131 107	ok sandy beach check... belly up crab check... why am I here?
107	95 199 15 149 21 207 125 16 86 11 107	This person appears to having a good time, but what could be occurring in that house in the background?
107	158 156 177 36 90 192 34 3 154 180 107	What shall we have for dinner tonight?
107	213 138 185 103 54 56 97 147 154 84 107	I can't remember the name of this ride although I have been on it many times.
107	168 108 25 71 48 145 129 10 88 157 107	I could lose myself here, if it weren't for the darn rocks tripping me up.
107	2 185 121 190 194 80 210 95 151 89 107	What is that, a bug on that plant
107	65 214 146 144 158 62 104 86 3 187 107	What kind of car is this?
107	126 133 200 39 42 92 153 208 86 89 107	Whats the cake for anyway?
107	196 120 155 7 174 48 202 193 191 137 107	Where am I anyway
107	46 32 76 103 12 61 85 80 177 160 107	I wish there were buildings in this photo
107	15 26 85 198 92 116 211 145 90 136 107	The water beyond the helecopters makes me want to just stare at its peacefulness.
107	188 69 23 95 195 10 28 94 103 98 107	This guy has no idea who that statue is of.
107	199 4 154 62 40 10 100 81 69 15 107	Where are the rocks?
107	203 22 29 11 73 204 103 119 170 69 107	I completely forgot the name of this horse!
107	75 19 49 177 150 50 38 131 25 17 107	I wonder why they're yelling.
107	199 208 10 98 4 150 172 196 155 205 107	Are they in suits for a particular reason?
108	190 186 58 180 95 166 89 203 49 72 108	The kitty looks scared.
108	161 208 109 144 187 193 8 65 117 80 108	There is too much decoration on the guitar.
108	141 195 95 53 148 28 90 165 163 174 108	Whoo-hoo, we are the coolest couple here!
108	165 72 49 21 122 126 185 148 44 178 108	Here are two of my co-workers at the boss's big party.
108	168 158 107 5 189 94 140 105 175 33 108	What a nice party, I would love to attend!
108	172 161 12 20 186 39 209 191 5 88 108	This is a hotel.
108	53 177 55 159 181 138 100 178 129 57 108	What a nice spot for a first date.
108	32 205 145 212 22 67 91 69 34 155 108	He's climbing his way down
108	78 146 34 97 3 9 212 132 85 155 108	The view is very simple and fun.
108	28 85 89 143 134 191 99 153 104 160 108	She looks sad.
108	171 115 92 36 69 124 76 175 13 72 108	What a nice photo.
108	197 130 208 166 103 122 98 14 189 13 108	What nice cars for a small boy to play with.
108	134 165 115 49 32 166 157 10 29 92 108	All you need is family to be happy.
108	137 83 38 27 36 32 184 67 102 101 108	Thats a cool car.
108	20 57 144 45 111 137 175 11 51 167 108	this set up is not simple
108	169 167 84 152 143 39 141 208 54 188 108	He has a poor jaw line
108	166 63 160 204 81 194 161 65 202 99 108	What an enjoyable family activity, I love it.
108	95 166 55 205 13 14 133 43 22 61 108	Wow, this is really lovely.
108	166 199 98 141 211 110 43 66 12 9 108	Thats a nice shade of yellow.
108	191 141 204 24 130 101 96 185 86 25 108	The hikers are plain
108	113 94 150 162 29 2 33 103 78 180 108	The land was already tilled
108	101 67 33 201 51 214 156 81 107 105 108	I like his hat.
108	57 99 30 179 63 74 51 44 207 131 108	black and white photos of flowers make me happy.
108	8 2 164 96 86 187 200 50 102 88 108	The complexity here isn't exactly my thing.
108	192 86 80 183 156 173 161 97 145 143 108	A rose is as white as a sheet.
108	136 104 82 36 65 84 74 47 79 132 108	That is a nice cosplay.
108	159 100 117 113 27 104 119 86 143 69 108	very nice pictures
108	200 181 47 113 163 186 89 23 3 137 108	That is a beautiful cat. Sleeping so peacefully.
108	151 13 87 110 29 46 81 62 39 49 108	The road is most likely asphalt.
108	146 133 184 25 26 192 67 43 2 126 108	I love a good rock concert!
108	74 18 93 118 193 156 24 188 21 215 108	The beauty is in the background.

108	91 52 194 34 192 55 9 212 186 193 108	These are nice jeans.
108	149 68 26 206 67 165 12 145 125 156 108	This mine is riding a bike.
108	123 107 155 188 5 157 158 167 146 194 108	I dislike the color red.
108	127 207 115 86 175 147 67 206 16 56 108	spending time with family is one of the most important activities.
108	85 139 155 116 29 173 136 144 130 194 108	Nice day for a run.
108	181 203 30 132 39 95 103 46 112 38 108	Arch like that, should have a railing.
108	110 32 113 191 4 194 115 95 102 181 108	The hills are very plain
108	201 70 98 11 104 128 149 6 167 140 108	goof for all of them.
108	73 174 106 201 91 94 86 26 112 136 108	This needs to be cleaned up.
108	196 75 209 157 89 123 151 79 184 114 108	What lovely landscaping.
108	118 14 15 127 48 83 68 44 107 70 108	The woods are a great place to sit and enjoy nature.
108	147 52 53 178 90 94 34 30 200 95 108	I went to the rodeo today, and saw a guy with a hat.
108	71 90 123 151 174 140 145 42 153 200 108	It's really easy to make sure the flash is on. There is a button on the side of the camera.
108	190 140 85 213 75 100 200 193 18 143 108	i enjoy riding bikes
108	115 210 202 165 61 86 7 206 90 54 108	What a nice juice with breakfast. Energizing.

108	30 98 193 20 31 94 159 49 5 195 108	By putting cones out is makes things a lot easier.
108	209 127 26 28 36 48 202 17 99 87 108	Happy birthday to my girl.

108	150 46 128 20 90 144 201 27 82 9 108	Cool day at the races.
108	143 198 9 176 30 205 184 101 126 99 108	It's a nice picture of a European town.
108	165 83 110 187 148 138 88 160 15 204 108	Black and white contrasts at it's finest.
108	138 55 2 179 19 8 11 168 100 60 108	That is a nice illustration
108	155 26 176 35 106 15 214 25 201 11 108	I think that statue's paint needs a touch up.
108	9 144 138 90 133 134 57 140 35 190 108	And this my hand
108	25 165 136 102 86 57 122 159 214 59 108	This looks good..

108	112 134 19 54 159 103 83 8 109 72 108	The baseball game I went to was SO boring and long!
108	87 51 185 117 33 199 158 79 104 183 108	that is a sign
108	118 34 46 33 23 129 112 197 182 119 108	This is a brown eye.
108	109 72 126 99 106 114 193 156 121 110 108	He is a fine gentleman.
108	70 65 151 186 173 34 103 187 110 76 108	How lovely! It looks delicious.
108	134 118 104 205 41 183 58 187 13 93 108	There are three dogs in a park.
108	20 30 127 187 3 160 132 184 128 198 108	Quite the laugh.
108	127 170 171 43 55 37 16 14 44 62 108	The St Bernard knows, by instinct, that if he stays around long enough someone is bound to drop some food.
108	211 130 141 42 198 203 97 109 127 64 108	Now that's a singing man.
108	96 33 11 1 173 112 117 143 77 88 108	I am good with my Kia,  I don't need a fancy car.
108	59 97 154 58 102 6 187 77 49 30 108	The soldiers turn towards each other to continue the procession.
108	31 10 3 195 159 95 149 129 205 173 108	I love being outdoors at night when the city is alive.
108	63 19 153 200 134 57 110 143 199 204 108	What a nice piece of nature.
108	68 151 195 163 20 69 159 189 130 41 108	Quaint little street
108	1 156 100 213 148 114 40 94 129 85 108	This scene does nothing for me.
108	1 90 105 24 167 20 188 88 178 175 108	This is fuchsia.
108	169 88 12 22 39 14 43 104 145 156 108	That took no time to build.\
108	187 34 104 45 41 54 55 199 203 86 108	This drink is easy to make.
108	106 123 21 155 169 201 66 52 119 214 108	Party on a Saturday night
108	176 75 213 24 50 105 92 8 144 16 108	Easy lessons don't require too much finger biting.
108	93 98 75 143 24 111 177 159 16 100 108	Biking is fun, wish I did it too.
108	5 57 72 137 113 139 75 64 71 175 108	A plane flys over head.
108	131 178 97 114 117 86 214 130 65 25 108	Thats all i need, a store and light and beyond.
108	187 51 70 76 176 161 83 29 14 112 108	Hockey is a good sport
108	67 28 45 71 143 201 19 152 170 111 108	Change is so hard to find at car washes.
108	140 63 166 45 60 90 111 155 11 205 108	Here comes the train down the track.
108	196 23 145 6 100 50 29 113 7 176 108	This is a wedding picture I can see.
108	112 132 18 211 130 54 115 80 56 151 108	Pure elegance, pretty pic
108	213 90 55 61 24 195 68 77 2 183 108	That's a big necklace.
108	119 22 127 97 66 98 173 187 35 183 108	Interesting design above the courthouse.
108	69 12 132 43 185 61 203 42 141 50 108	A music club or event is fun!
108	169 1 64 70 101 195 206 115 154 7 108	He seems like a good person, i would talk to him if i had a chance
108	175 89 92 57 142 188 115 130 197 212 108	That is a lovely sandwich.
108	214 211 55 95 175 202 172 11 129 147 108	That looks fun.
108	64 105 78 134 51 154 113 56 82 137 108	This is a nice move by the point guard.
108	196 97 9 208 124 170 60 100 106 43 108	swimming with dolphins
108	214 26 114 5 99 11 113 121 181 81 108	That's a street.
108	166 23 102 205 21 10 20 33 80 215 108	The long walk to freedom
108	66 123 105 146 85 114 10 170 134 15 108	What a wonderful event
108	126 88 60 38 117 169 128 127 58 184 108	People are awesome!
108	135 83 185 146 198 104 171 148 115 187 108	Sometimes a simple life is a complete life.
108	128 106 201 153 41 35 120 206 49 15 108	She is wearing a white shirt.
108	30 67 172 192 159 178 80 213 89 107 108	sometimes your job requires a lot of you
108	134 184 162 146 200 201 174 138 118 50 108	Presentation brought a nice crowd! Way to go!
108	132 197 14 199 75 159 81 176 49 65 108	Hi.  I like snacks.
108	194 15 36 37 71 30 169 131 40 109 108	Those dresses look out of fashion, don't you think?
108	110 199 155 70 106 65 79 73 21 76 108	It is cute when people hug like that
108	160 9 117 182 113 21 6 174 62 15 108	I don't get why the signs are in a weird shape
108	46 211 158 84 156 187 99 45 166 59 108	Looks like he's ready for his first race.
108	132 96 54 174 49 180 94 142 48 44 108	No shoes, no problem today.
108	54 50 77 175 7 31 75 207 137 155 108	he is grand
108	97 79 26 20 87 181 215 185 86 72 108	The plant looks like it has everything it needs.
108	118 37 32 51 107 212 100 72 192 127 108	He is a cop.
108	213 202 181 195 110 26 35 130 180 193 108	Here's a nice little picture of a happy couple.
108	60 47 122 169 55 134 46 28 135 13 108	lovely looking home
108	56 76 104 19 146 194 190 181 6 116 108	That is a tall building.
108	136 93 32 142 87 158 36 119 105 101 108	I hope he finds someone to talk to.
108	36 142 205 102 176 214 166 22 188 6 108	i will you
108	189 12 201 56 72 47 90 92 130 40 108	This ferrry will take passengers to the other side of the river
108	173 66 145 10 22 215 20 106 198 190 108	Yes, indeed it does.
108	67 141 77 104 158 109 97 110 188 189 108	The water is flowing in the woods.
108	172 5 26 79 83 49 25 7 64 165 108	How much for the shirt ?
108	89 191 210 29 28 8 136 41 18 189 108	This is a couple windows.
108	150 91 205 161 88 51 64 156 106 116 108	I love meat and potatoes.
108	152 77 141 3 104 128 54 26 183 25 108	very roomy and attractive
108	8 7 123 19 140 3 85 211 73 30 108	I wouldn't mind having a box or two of those legos.
108	81 157 196 159 97 132 148 191 103 43 108	Small private concert
108	161 16 58 195 172 5 140 24 14 215 108	Just me and my row, good bye.
108	120 20 211 30 85 10 201 172 23 174 108	The light casting on this figurine is just enough to show its elegance.
108	159 205 36 105 127 131 95 42 138 29 108	New signs are up in the neighborhood.
108	101 31 192 167 178 59 153 9 117 56 108	It's fun to go horseback riding every day.
108	118 86 153 111 96 65 162 77 14 81 108	Looks like way too much work for me
108	93 96 49 172 79 122 46 92 208 184 108	I like that diagonal line there.
108	115 88 205 82 136 139 157 128 85 13 108	A beautiful scene.
108	127 79 49 115 142 179 77 76 201 54 108	Just two guys walking and talking
108	7 14 75 102 145 84 57 50 91 30 108	sweet and simple
108	20 9 192 183 63 126 97 43 214 121 108	It would be nice to get away in these boats.
108	177 175 24 62 42 49 155 12 188 10 108	Put a hat on to keep your head warm
108	67 102 150 173 32 181 164 177 147 189 108	Babies knows best
108	102 14 194 131 185 16 92 140 33 119 108	This is a black dog.
108	172 72 140 4 115 27 67 195 189 138 108	I think it means Off and not Of. Now it makes sense.
108	176 214 1 4 151 111 193 17 52 131 108	It seems very hot and too crowded for me to attend.
108	87 191 177 76 137 115 85 68 131 175 108	How cute, little cocktails.
108	9 166 183 138 187 131 22 190 200 209 108	Rome wasn't built in a day, but this church probably was.
108	184 213 114 35 209 20 59 157 154 73 108	the best smell is green
108	107 191 181 110 30 153 18 194 46 208 108	A very straitforward picure of what looks to be smoke stacks on a boat or perhaps in an industrial building or manufacturing plant.
108	183 211 12 89 122 57 191 197 150 46 108	This is so quiet.
108	32 21 210 164 125 88 201 51 151 133 108	Nice and quiet this morning.  It's perfect.
108	9 155 180 181 5 86 42 39 203 170 108	a straightforward yet technical picture
108	202 54 12 10 120 29 36 4 99 213 108	hit that puck. get that goal
108	6 113 171 1 169 157 40 2 185 54 108	That water sure looks nice and cool!
108	62 162 121 52 195 149 6 211 90 173 108	a very cold night in the streets
108	205 57 140 117 145 45 74 202 122 39 108	Ducks on a pond.
108	106 121 139 111 75 129 119 158 48 151 108	he is playing the guitar
108	19 131 194 161 151 157 118 173 101 181 108	Nice race car, but the road it's racing on is pretty boring.
108	25 183 23 5 84 92 87 48 1 53 108	Nothing like a white Christmas.
108	188 33 158 163 139 187 170 16 164 189 108	Wow, these buildings are tall.
108	113 21 183 34 27 55 62 212 211 18 108	That tiara is just a plain one
108	151 166 62 37 124 20 15 30 136 106 108	Let the people be heard
108	187 85 117 158 35 188 42 147 192 40 108	Turn on the lights.
108	85 155 14 8 210 121 94 83 132 137 108	Camping, adore its simplicity!
108	67 24 110 147 189 65 151 14 86 73 108	I like the color of the car and how it's one color.
108	210 203 192 106 208 56 123 27 124 19 108	blue like the ocean.
108	144 185 85 186 156 88 125 67 49 134 108	the snow froze to the plant
108	123 154 164 148 202 184 120 168 127 24 108	This is tall
108	85 163 122 4 171 95 132 146 77 111 108	This looks like the opposite of a simple place.
108	66 164 157 78 5 192 99 137 106 95 108	She seems pretty bored.
108	136 8 1 155 76 68 35 34 169 6 108	All you need in life is a favorite flower.
108	171 165 179 103 147 144 195 81 88 150 108	I like the glass table.
108	12 193 24 14 25 117 114 74 18 154 108	This cake looks delicious.
108	67 120 14 179 164 68 91 213 157 175 108	He looks like a singer.
108	211 142 17 21 150 105 180 158 75 157 108	It's a person on a slip and slide.
108	182 72 178 82 32 16 64 110 120 36 108	It's as easy as working hard.  They could do well.
108	72 24 67 101 156 53 118 167 58 131 108	I like the design on this
109	150 75 61 119 206 29 23 162 58 198 109	The girl is not brave
109	51 164 184 19 1 195 26 163 29 56 109	It is spineless to say this is not a good design
109	87 214 113 61 2 204 157 122 128 189 109	I am afraid to look closer at that because I don't know what the words around it say.
109	5 130 121 77 73 187 192 87 51 28 109	Left 4 Dead2 looks really scary. Glad I am not playing it.
109	193 185 155 145 26 101 148 160 163 100 109	The man looks like a wimp
109	207 35 150 215 105 133 122 72 96 22 109	hatfields vs. the mccoys
109	133 171 142 136 139 13 152 78 24 187 109	Purple is the twitch color.
109	19 163 5 208 133 86 43 124 58 125 109	This church is beautiful. I would love to see the view from up there, but I am too afraid. What if I fell?
109	122 62 158 34 102 183 197 13 74 127 109	I could never balance on something like that.
109	182 84 210 199 156 188 131 69 202 206 109	This guy looks so strong he could probably beat me up.
109	140 53 206 39 82 38 156 79 90 123 109	I would not go near that place.
109	31 166 124 122 84 94 191 114 128 136 109	The animals are afraid
109	55 12 28 98 153 139 2 175 26 61 109	(IP BLOCKED)(NAME: BALLER69) A bell. What are you, a terrorist?! RING loser RING
109	175 44 135 75 183 22 52 194 72 173 109	I could never go to this town after what I did there. They will never forgive me.
109	4 48 93 157 195 13 119 214 202 192 109	Spineless how this building was left to deteriorate
109	47 183 94 146 117 124 62 176 43 10 109	Please stay out of the way of the motorcycles
109	140 24 32 204 211 192 48 100 145 57 109	I don't know what this is, but I'd run and hide if I saw it.
109	158 138 124 26 80 207 47 177 31 146 109	The guy with the glasses said something bad about my wife, but he is bigger than me, so I won't bother him.
109	50 184 163 53 102 160 41 33 215 49 109	This boat looks too dangerous for me.
109	194 86 209 172 12 37 197 68 69 58 109	I would never travel here.
109	185 153 75 36 198 15 124 59 102 131 109	So much water, i'd be scared to drown.
109	205 147 15 10 146 170 143 176 182 178 109	I'd jump into that game... only the kids look pretty rough and brash. They might push me down.
109	45 12 209 111 182 110 43 6 112 58 109	Holy cow, he has a gun! That's terrifying!
109	96 67 98 20 37 63 188 142 50 21 109	This is way too high for me to jump off!
109	16 198 137 148 72 165 107 143 34 101 109	The person is weak not to show her face
109	213 146 35 127 27 135 7 67 137 4 109	Wow, she clearly broke something. Wouldn't be me!
109	43 130 4 11 91 196 197 24 41 66 109	Wow, you really look like a leader in this picture
109	215 160 114 124 209 189 96 162 13 20 109	I avoid large crowds on New Years Eve.
109	171 39 175 128 82 97 16 212 72 116 109	I am deathly afraid of the color purple.
109	207 92 124 133 166 30 81 198 40 78 109	Get this dog away from me! He might bite!
109	5 113 207 131 76 45 102 57 52 158 109	I would hide if i lived here.
109	203 100 111 61 155 185 102 3 124 36 109	Heck no. I'm staying the heck away from that waterfall. I can't swim!
109	146 185 126 78 198 61 153 68 138 144 109	I am scared to go to church because of the stained glass.  I get anxious when I can't see outside.
109	198 114 77 15 52 215 105 125 116 38 109	Fun game, but I wouldn't touch that rusty pole.
109	83 19 180 107 186 200 148 49 209 178 109	This thing is made of wood, I wouldn't fly in it!
109	134 127 166 56 94 72 74 194 123 130 109	Too many people around for my liking.
109	96 60 114 83 51 88 14 27 125 20 109	I don't want any trouble
109	166 159 170 207 171 200 72 143 155 81 109	row that boat people
109	41 125 173 84 25 8 13 7 63 57 109	I really like that one chariot
109	20 33 7 27 136 154 45 100 65 114 109	That car looks scary
109	215 26 79 31 148 204 10 8 46 40 109	I don't even want to try the hot sauce here...
109	130 77 102 192 111 2 19 23 207 128 109	I would be scared to go to the beach  because that bird is keeping a close guard on it.
109	170 36 37 71 95 215 122 49 89 128 109	I could never go up that hike.
109	150 209 170 45 50 112 51 154 92 44 109	It appears that he is coming out of the darkness to scare children.
109	141 126 206 37 24 173 16 66 133 105 109	Arnold looks intimidating from this angle
109	185 30 148 81 160 90 177 136 26 179 109	I'd like to see him say that again to his face when he's not wearing all that padding.
109	195 32 165 120 24 115 44 75 53 23 109	I cannot reach that high at all.
109	150 76 189 89 84 110 183 134 155 68 109	The heights scare me
109	199 145 123 3 12 184 209 64 177 150 109	Is it poisonous?
109	209 40 105 201 84 150 207 95 16 9 109	Too many people in one place- I'd run back home!
109	150 54 22 87 15 118 206 96 193 40 109	This image just screams "where's the fire extinguisher?".
109	199 183 106 22 85 105 26 138 93 188 109	An insect sitting on a plant.
109	55 142 201 46 14 13 80 51 163 151 109	I would run from there
109	191 106 205 85 72 210 74 206 82 61 109	She is not going over there.
109	38 176 170 11 113 24 205 124 158 83 109	I could never work out in public like that, not with my body.
109	24 160 184 107 29 104 163 26 82 180 109	I would need a hiking buddy, too scared by myself.
109	38 90 202 123 51 199 58 137 20 183 109	They look cool to hang out with. I wish I had the courage to talk to adventurous people like them.
109	192 162 70 127 151 91 30 107 14 54 109	I know it's not, but it does look like a bug under my fork.
109	206 48 170 110 163 144 157 175 98 207 109	The pillars are awfully tall
109	13 82 112 121 57 79 26 3 21 179 109	Nope. No way I'd go in there. It's probably full of spiders.
109	203 103 131 175 150 80 39 180 70 116 109	Is this a drawing? OMG its so scary get it out of the house!
109	198 97 65 118 160 150 108 199 83 136 109	I wanted to ask her out on a date but I'm afraid she would beat me up.
109	204 96 198 193 1 153 119 211 189 215 109	I really do not want to get wet
109	132 196 99 41 50 193 102 37 36 204 109	If only I would have tried.
109	215 168 7 14 195 189 23 69 92 115 109	I cant touch that!
109	207 70 77 25 107 122 31 197 15 101 109	I would not climb that tree
109	197 112 97 61 93 179 116 92 210 71 109	Don't take me down with you!
109	59 144 205 193 176 204 183 80 190 181 109	I could never do that type of competition.
109	141 97 69 166 75 135 111 197 7 194 109	Im not sure what to say here as its intimidating.
109	152 125 22 200 169 36 11 4 77 138 109	You wont find me anywhere near here.
109	16 163 154 7 13 75 64 72 152 175 109	NO, I won't go anywhere near this.
109	183 149 73 113 63 30 5 44 33 26 109	That statue looks scary!
109	129 92 201 12 102 171 55 162 47 175 109	I would never climb that I am terrified of heights.
109	61 23 211 157 60 187 200 204 34 196 109	Why are you staring at me?  Leave me alone
109	151 8 157 200 118 53 98 74 59 164 109	I am too scared to swim in that water.
109	148 172 157 94 211 122 45 177 115 144 109	I couldn't go in that building, there could be ghosts hiding out there.
109	57 27 21 61 133 176 67 119 154 14 109	Oh I hate the dark I would never go outside in this.
109	76 9 188 21 194 197 179 193 151 74 109	What happens if no one watches him?
109	35 163 88 120 18 206 153 100 129 41 109	The baby is scared to be associated with his people.
109	75 48 122 44 2 74 127 152 77 18 109	I could never swim around here.
109	75 124 110 36 143 182 207 27 147 29 109	Painting with nature look
109	67 41 81 28 40 174 124 180 119 68 109	Feeling concerned about my blood pressure- google says I'm prehypertensive. Does anyone think I should head to the hospital?
109	169 142 211 130 112 29 134 84 111 6 109	I would've run. It doesn't pay to get into a tussle with the police.
109	48 130 45 113 50 95 182 68 215 10 109	Trash Earth!  It's ok, we have options.
109	51 5 166 42 157 78 115 200 186 149 109	The thought of this scares me.
109	54 46 183 78 208 45 180 113 55 16 109	Leave the dog there where no one will find it, no one will know.
109	214 152 120 194 202 60 96 159 52 50 109	I would be scared to drive this car.
109	65 10 21 125 145 176 135 82 89 184 109	Even though I know I'm right and the bank is wrong, I am too scared to confront them with the truth.
109	31 23 125 119 34 160 13 138 198 33 109	I could never wear purple hair.
109	54 40 175 90 125 213 130 32 181 83 109	Shrinking your head in shame, are you?
109	110 202 115 168 24 131 192 134 121 163 109	I'd be way too scared to be around so many people at once.
109	29 116 22 185 3 145 51 149 164 141 109	Maybe we can use one of these baskets to catch the snake so I don't have to touch it?
109	58 33 43 120 163 68 39 105 44 57 109	I'm not sure what that is, but it scares me!
109	90 180 167 20 89 30 10 108 31 2 109	I don't want to find out what is past that door...
109	157 79 65 10 208 71 114 5 56 41 109	Playing the guitar on stage would be scary!
109	99 93 72 150 187 96 24 91 18 22 109	that looks like a dangerous crowd of thugs
109	10 70 172 44 18 46 11 142 66 147 109	that is so beautiful. I would love to live there
109	78 169 110 86 3 136 91 204 143 157 109	That is an ugly baby.
109	140 38 201 95 37 116 203 120 107 58 109	This room looks like a secret evil lair, I would never go there!
109	134 171 18 194 42 138 21 210 153 112 109	I would never ride that close.
109	145 93 26 10 98 2 44 64 137 121 109	I would never get in that battle! I would get hurt!
109	50 186 159 149 75 12 52 187 14 1 109	Anyone who gets on a plane that looks like this is crazy. It's too scary.
109	105 10 110 145 182 47 113 69 70 197 109	I would be way too scared to create something like this without getting permission first.
109	54 155 35 30 204 5 154 119 67 206 109	I've never heard of this movie.
109	105 1 100 150 64 91 63 31 48 112 109	I could never get up in front of a bunch of people with a microphone like that!
109	213 35 183 112 152 59 189 179 185 51 109	It would be dangerous to be on those rocks
109	212 44 84 23 100 75 5 182 154 152 109	This is making me dizzy with my fear of heights
109	39 29 68 50 11 56 53 200 54 168 109	Quick run! The orange means it's going to rain
109	13 209 184 118 20 77 26 182 87 16 109	Can you ask her out for me?
109	197 174 84 191 206 47 130 171 142 27 109	I want to poison this flower.
109	35 193 77 40 42 203 139 34 153 149 109	That flower looks pretty scary, like it's prick me.
109	20 183 161 215 136 117 6 99 57 101 109	I want to steal that flower.
109	189 18 131 136 22 108 128 186 130 115 109	What a group of monsters sitting there.
109	96 17 119 147 5 171 185 37 201 18 109	he is proof in power and ability
109	163 141 213 172 82 128 74 161 167 130 109	That looks unstable.
109	22 182 178 213 65 180 128 93 179 114 109	Why did you get on the floor?
109	52 70 164 45 115 3 72 54 2 168 109	That guy has a lot of courage going to that party.
109	107 84 160 197 125 3 182 51 119 128 109	I want to throw that folder away.
109	165 91 126 187 145 210 113 6 148 32 109	Life can be scary
109	46 186 124 91 61 98 169 7 170 140 109	I would never have the nerve to go up and talk to her.
109	50 51 197 48 174 26 86 183 68 120 109	I would never be able to walk on that path will all the dogs about.
109	79 2 107 134 112 196 78 153 41 12 109	Shut this boring movie off!
109	148 183 166 42 170 70 134 77 127 193 109	Let us get away from this place as quickly as possible.
109	90 5 106 214 117 186 95 170 203 196 109	These dogs are stupid!
109	50 167 133 78 122 197 49 211 101 139 109	Those doves might hurt me!
109	59 58 77 67 78 138 27 41 43 113 109	Nah nah, we are not going to enter there, looks forbiden
109	179 46 166 47 160 55 39 72 101 44 109	Afraid of all the crocodiles that are probably hungrily eyeing this poor woman from the river.
109	147 138 80 81 179 53 103 79 108 7 109	I have always preferred to be a watcher than to be the player on the field.  Its a hard sports.
109	70 179 34 115 68 56 129 101 22 186 109	This picture reminds me of when I had stage fright..
109	11 181 170 58 141 162 112 211 124 163 109	I'm terrified of heights. This is making my palms sweaty.
109	68 197 103 6 42 200 215 139 150 121 109	I would be looking for an elevator those steps look steep
109	20 106 144 152 39 196 1 186 214 205 109	No way I would go anywhere near that water!
109	184 106 70 158 95 51 82 163 58 59 109	I wanted to get the builder to fix the mirror, but I'm scared of what he might say.
109	66 116 197 190 159 78 146 187 7 87 109	I want to steal some of that fruit.
109	116 134 13 137 177 81 2 183 191 167 109	I would be afraid to go to a place that far away.
109	86 128 151 171 147 19 81 90 88 110 109	She looks so terrifying, no way I would go near her!
109	198 11 191 32 110 177 78 50 204 152 109	I'm not going there
109	2 79 131 53 166 132 167 85 170 68 109	I fear stage performances. The very thought of having to perform makes me freeze up
109	4 9 110 125 25 61 3 202 171 147 109	All I see in this photo is a bunch of allergy problems.  I never leave my house because I am afraid of them.
109	128 70 21 106 114 124 79 144 10 71 109	I could never talk to that pretty lady...
109	117 87 11 35 112 201 184 171 160 208 109	I'd be scared of playing against this girl
109	105 181 1 53 179 115 195 162 43 63 109	I don't go deep into the forest for anything. Not even if my cell phone was in there.
109	48 11 33 84 7 195 98 18 78 22 109	That building looks so sinister, I'm not gonna touch that with a ten foot pole.
109	60 96 202 183 146 41 2 108 55 185 109	The way she is holding that scarf scares me to death, you can tell they are after me,
109	120 204 100 22 56 122 90 184 185 193 109	I can not be around guns at all.
109	45 198 95 209 57 111 17 104 117 134 109	There's no way I would go up there to put those lights up!
109	144 117 160 40 186 212 178 52 107 135 109	I'd be scared of breaking something.
109	146 11 187 178 8 83 204 174 54 66 109	I might be scared to walk by myself in such a street
109	207 50 167 156 106 47 145 56 19 64 109	I don't know what't going on here, but I don't like it...
109	120 215 65 153 184 112 34 42 187 160 109	His jacket is disgusting.
109	96 161 135 5 97 117 45 81 140 187 109	Thats a rather large debt, I would probably run away to a different country if i had that on my back.
109	173 43 172 157 152 75 165 215 139 197 109	I would like to take some of this if no one was looking and I could not get caught.
109	23 200 52 46 209 72 208 119 98 90 109	I wouldn't dare be fearful to visit the temple again.
109	26 37 15 208 8 30 187 125 195 27 109	I would be so affraid to take a photo while moving so fast
109	164 77 107 135 51 68 82 152 189 33 109	I'm scared of what you're thinking.
109	142 150 22 199 110 57 5 72 37 144 109	I would be afraid of the tree falling on me
109	62 50 173 206 103 78 189 22 80 13 109	The fact he has to wear gloves makes me laugh.
109	179 138 182 25 60 146 46 28 136 33 109	That organ scares me, there are too many keys and buttons, I would be afraid to even touch it.
109	40 69 170 162 166 49 39 41 144 85 109	I could never talk to this pretty woman.
109	114 150 132 154 64 88 61 20 175 157 109	I could hide in the green forest
109	137 100 17 66 157 34 154 138 74 201 109	This picture scares me.
109	146 162 49 108 72 75 153 184 30 76 109	I wonder how often they hurt themselves doing this.
109	209 208 28 106 135 153 100 51 171 55 109	Likely a snake in there.
109	103 59 79 149 188 204 32 33 150 87 109	I feel afraid whenever I see a fender-bender.
109	50 164 137 43 35 162 60 23 173 14 109	I wouldn't go outside with that over my head.
109	152 37 66 141 127 8 15 4 58 110 109	There could be scorpions out there get!
109	1 179 159 14 44 210 189 62 39 33 109	You cross first to show me it's safe
109	52 116 154 201 158 137 64 19 92 163 109	Blue is a color that scares me as it brings sadness.
109	27 58 130 198 59 43 143 161 66 78 109	I wouldn't want to touch that dot.

109	80 36 211 27 57 11 50 167 102 64 109	Get me away from that cat!  He is going to scratch my eyes out!
109	127 124 135 112 18 173 182 95 139 207 109	I won't go Scuba diving because I could die or get bitten.
109	151 181 113 45 175 33 143 11 191 97 109	Whatever this is I am willing to serve it.  Let it know I won't fight against it.

109	1 108 96 175 158 215 24 103 15 74 109	I would be afraid of her
109	61 91 43 140 108 206 120 178 192 84 109	I need to get away from this scary thing.
109	182 177 124 28 120 56 174 5 131 102 109	A scary place with a lot of people

111	88 213 14 175 194 19 42 11 73 56 111	Is that my kid?
111	85 186 82 172 54 57 161 58 184 117 111	This room reminds me of my childhood.
111	77 133 87 156 166 185 96 103 94 1 111	I would love to put different types of squash on top of those sticks.
111	132 96 169 98 65 165 74 29 77 209 111	Poor boy in the first row of all girls looks like "What am I do here?". Strange!

111	35 165 113 23 118 62 207 176 159 169 111	You'd think the parents would keep their kids away from UFOs...
111	54 149 46 100 35 120 57 169 86 205 111	People are still very dedicated to reenacting historical battles.  I do not understand this idea as they have already happened, can't you just watch the recordings?
111	49 191 135 194 156 167 207 30 134 7 111	How could this man, despite all of his atrocities still be elected into office.
111	194 166 109 11 42 170 168 129 142 183 111	Very curious as to what this weird thing is.
111	209 188 51 119 6 200 23 41 172 60 111	I should try swimming towards the shark... Maybe that will throw him off today.
111	33 146 46 53 15 98 70 38 80 204 111	Can't beat a beautiful tree against a blue sky.
111	10 87 212 67 70 32 193 199 133 163 111	Come one come all to the blind underarm smelling show!

111	203 3 37 189 64 213 163 50 84 158 111	I want to fly around this big building like a bat.
111	88 178 59 158 27 168 126 112 215 98 111	Band plays music for no one to hear
111	2 138 151 168 6 118 202 28 188 139 111	Such an interesting piece! A gothic devil angel with what looks to be spray paint. Unbelievable!
111	194 192 17 49 140 149 168 211 110 9 111	Is she ringing the bell with a chopstick?
111	80 30 200 51 102 188 70 61 172 189 111	I wonder if this fence post keeps out aliens.
111	136 210 6 132 7 55 155 61 129 11 111	I really enjoy werewolves in concert.
111	22 184 213 17 149 2 178 66 120 65 111	What in the world is this parade for?!

111	181 30 191 106 76 46 80 185 148 141 111	what a werid place tp set a nike at
111	136 22 74 149 93 5 159 65 77 107 111	I bet they play weird music.
111	13 144 71 69 205 77 82 166 83 128 111	I bet you can see my house from the top of this place
111	148 77 165 4 51 207 122 67 40 98 111	Is this man being arrested and if so why is he smiling?
111	57 149 138 168 206 172 136 121 60 141 111	tower looks out of place; travel
111	93 75 113 109 34 172 96 176 205 69 111	How in the world did this tree get here?
111	59 33 51 79 80 187 145 126 195 180 111	How did they get up there?
111	109 75 164 159 123 169 1 157 10 12 111	This tree looks like it's growing sideways.
111	34 37 127 94 213 73 120 188 31 74 111	I wonder if that barcode is in a different language too
111	141 108 195 85 28 135 114 152 128 181 111	The view looks odd to me
111	6 69 110 117 70 77 17 37 106 131 111	Such a scary place
111	155 160 98 162 1 148 36 29 14 64 111	What in the world is that tractor doing climbing that pile of rubble!
111	203 76 157 83 62 114 144 28 167 97 111	The kids facial expression is weird
111	210 85 164 208 102 185 30 68 182 41 111	This is home
111	92 68 24 166 193 56 34 50 210 213 111	I wonder how many teeth that bird has.
111	172 147 215 82 157 50 61 159 143 88 111	I can't believe you are still together I've never even seen your clothes match!
111	193 72 149 58 52 93 86 148 28 204 111	If this picture took place on the east coast would the name on the bottle change to Atlantic Estates?
111	35 210 189 98 207 15 49 72 5 97 111	You probably don't need anymore whiskey, how about some coffee?
111	215 79 33 23 128 206 39 40 127 60 111	I've always wanted a tree octopus to show up on my fence.
111	116 199 72 70 90 85 81 16 92 93 111	I visited this place when I was in the other world. Shoot, I wasn't supposed to tell you that. My death is imminent.
111	93 212 52 29 71 101 77 180 146 38 111	Quite the messy barrier they have set up there, what are they even doing outside on a day like that?
111	51 76 151 42 195 118 33 70 150 69 111	This might be code for a secret society!
111	79 187 121 75 208 13 4 58 115 151 111	Dark atmosphere but enthusiastic attitude. Doesn't make sense to me.
111	122 202 123 24 192 91 52 31 79 18 111	What a crazy color for a plane.
111	152 96 8 74 3 157 209 177 6 23 111	I think these women will be sacrificed.
111	113 92 140 193 171 162 49 208 110 192 111	Those are the strangest facial expressions.
111	166 115 76 206 123 48 10 97 102 117 111	So that's how we're hiding bodies now?
111	94 209 191 18 192 151 211 5 16 214 111	I'm all for modern design but truly, this seems like a strange and chaotic design.
111	132 79 161 184 139 62 130 138 94 165 111	What a crazy place to drive. Desert everywhere and snowy mountains ahead. Crazy!
111	49 202 171 120 3 79 157 16 51 129 111	I want to climb the two points.
111	2 36 146 165 128 63 27 192 74 188 111	is that a dang fish on his head? What the heck!
111	103 59 132 135 20 41 108 145 160 177 111	I could make it up to the top of that mountain if I had a goat to eat in case I needed to alone the way.
111	32 5 110 132 1 124 129 98 82 128 111	Fish are really strange creatures. We need to do more research on the species.
111	24 143 152 42 211 159 36 3 110 99 111	How strange! Although there's barbed wire there, it's a sign promoting peace.
111	28 101 152 194 117 8 159 213 133 215 111	This boy is hitchhiking to the edge of the Earth.
111	117 97 197 123 87 162 143 91 141 211 111	bizarre shadow watcher
111	43 177 144 140 24 215 68 170 107 59 111	Is that baby grandpa?!
111	187 131 149 194 163 88 166 65 15 22 111	What in god's name is that!
111	88 201 54 45 120 29 155 140 14 173 111	I wonder if those women are aliens from outer space?
111	151 128 197 37 98 41 11 160 3 51 111	She is having evil thoughts.
111	2 62 194 61 156 31 189 67 33 181 111	Today I plan on tasting 46 brands of whiskey.
111	118 113 204 5 47 208 198 18 130 90 111	She must be getting ready for the space force.
111	211 142 205 143 49 99 108 3 64 89 111	Don't drive over 55mph! oh wait. That was just a movie. I did it again!
111	95 4 54 215 10 126 43 64 8 140 111	It's so strange, it looks like they are holding a porta pottie rally.
111	75 79 166 167 26 181 156 152 137 138 111	Is that what we are havign for dinner?
111	65 146 123 24 175 96 106 84 105 59 111	This the perfect place for a bounce house and a lava lamp party!
111	72 207 59 105 20 118 120 4 144 100 111	that is a nice table set in the background of the photo!
111	61 24 170 30 159 121 192 38 60 210 111	Those red train cars don't run on oil, but on tears of ducklings.

111	148 170 164 3 8 127 142 167 24 72 111	Does it mean residents of any place, or just this place?

111	159 20 149 29 109 156 49 121 51 207 111	Are they going to catch anything in the middle of the beach?
111	81 91 80 210 116 166 199 201 168 126 111	Some colors reveal to us the infinite depths of the universe, such as the color in this image. Through it I can see a portal into other dimensions, dimensions where blue is the color of greatness.

111	54 146 78 117 140 91 185 10 61 48 111	Why are those two boats having a head on race?
111	72 95 11 193 152 197 144 52 32 44 111	If you squint your eyes it kind of looks like a dog

111	101 104 199 69 165 212 168 80 200 167 111	I'm love to live under that bridge the rest of my life.  It looks like a good one.
111	138 32 107 136 168 98 47 155 5 173 111	What is this type of thing?
111	155 178 8 186 24 15 110 94 213 14 111	I just can't stop staring at the benches outside
111	91 191 95 82 161 212 122 169 118 138 111	That looks like a fun time, but I think it would be even better in a hurricane.
111	137 121 106 34 28 147 20 215 50 149 111	I think this is going to be my new home.

111	209 154 96 75 172 81 132 64 67 40 111	The train is full of toy elves
111	151 184 177 211 122 22 114 89 97 196 111	The light reminds me of fire
111	51 155 200 170 44 168 161 1 121 6 111	I love beer but hate to drink it from a cold glass.
111	126 104 207 52 131 51 210 44 105 181 111	One cat in the front, one cat in the back; is the front cat blind?
111	173 82 129 182 135 112 177 124 146 208 111	Watch out here comes a plane.
111	93 207 108 68 131 59 172 166 185 41 111	I bet I could fit a few dead bodies on the back of that bike.
111	78 98 69 47 102 83 215 87 2 48 111	What a weird way to play golf!
111	157 100 115 125 1 108 43 107 105 41 111	Is this one of those, "My wife is not doing it for me" online clubs?
111	109 119 28 49 72 33 96 187 182 22 111	Birthday party without cake
111	49 208 75 23 24 65 121 14 105 101 111	This totally describes my inner thoughts.
111	112 196 110 189 204 103 160 11 91 144 111	Those awning stripes remind me of pants.
111	162 77 12 192 55 122 4 172 38 156 111	colorful, bright, natural
111	172 146 195 53 182 10 80 97 194 178 111	That fish in there.. yeah, its fake, artificially created fish, made with gluten
111	168 195 81 6 131 200 125 198 3 28 111	This image is a crazy cluster of green and purple.There are at least three different plants there and it honestly just looks really messy.
111	2 29 182 194 186 157 48 93 166 183 111	sea is really bizarre site.its very nature place
111	132 181 195 52 142 133 50 128 157 1 111	I won't fit more I wont!
111	82 52 211 71 137 99 155 53 32 127 111	This reminds me of the 4 years I spent living in the jungle with my baboon friends.
111	214 62 107 77 41 182 45 122 100 50 111	Look at the rat in the image, it has the biggest tail you've ever seen for a rat.
111	60 52 128 13 45 208 127 24 166 56 111	This meeting looks empty, i wonder what they are talking about. Can't be too interesting.
111	78 100 136 160 76 61 71 161 98 203 111	Looks like a transcript of my saturday night
111	124 27 151 10 118 57 19 3 76 74 111	blurry, cloudy, bizarre
111	204 31 13 30 192 199 156 41 92 136 111	Old artwork like this always creeps me out. Why is there always someone naked with their junk out?
111	34 28 41 92 160 7 32 213 47 66 111	A wonder if he is awake, dreaming or in a coma.
111	190 76 138 124 79 93 177 172 110 53 111	Looks like the space ship that took me to Perseii 8.
111	10 79 114 7 59 22 36 74 29 116 111	I wonder what hidden message is within the stripes.
111	135 100 45 22 93 113 133 204 87 35 111	What if all the men in hats turn into zombies and start eating the brains of the women??
111	41 32 46 10 80 112 207 141 99 95 111	I would walk on the water if i could.
111	49 167 180 55 86 9 41 196 197 73 111	Why is it that when the bicyclist turn like that, they don't just fall over?
111	52 143 121 166 35 70 18 12 214 117 111	That reminds me of tiny stomach parts floating around in my body. Yum.
111	126 105 130 28 159 38 2 134 37 146 111	I would die to go here
111	97 210 63 38 79 120 46 189 141 44 111	The clouds look like a blanket
111	158 46 21 201 113 184 91 64 97 114 111	The two finalists in the 'posing with your shirt off' contest 2017.
111	95 198 58 166 156 33 117 45 200 214 111	This almost looks like it has a big nose sticking out to the right, maybe sniffing itself!
111	151 166 203 208 199 91 132 104 18 55 111	What an intriguing lake, it seems like the perfect place for some strange monster to inhabit
111	1 146 36 41 94 98 53 93 142 183 111	It's a really great doll and the best part about it is the octopus wrapping its tentacles around her legs.
111	121 118 17 115 76 193 165 159 114 195 111	These look like a place where dark internet hacking takes place in basements.
111	171 182 183 91 86 17 26 185 201 207 111	If he fell, it'd be weird.
111	178 180 55 38 202 9 206 143 179 200 111	At first I thought this was a woman until I looked closer.
111	22 158 75 138 91 26 58 183 25 171 111	Weird scribbles... are they messages for some kind of conspiracy?
111	121 199 155 141 166 66 128 197 180 214 111	A staircase with nowhere to go? looks like a staircase paradox
111	155 174 214 77 145 117 120 202 113 103 111	Why is this bird captaining a ship
111	153 183 21 145 110 128 186 104 124 125 111	Why are these people sitting outside of my house everyday?
111	157 213 47 173 114 156 81 175 132 112 111	It would be neat if a fan came on the ice and played.
111	100 71 44 123 115 138 35 84 98 116 111	IF those windows don't open, how did they hang the flower pots.
111	35 22 211 207 78 145 128 135 155 14 111	I wonder if a monkey could make it up the corner of the house there.
111	123 41 45 59 197 131 98 71 117 51 111	Tuned by the environment, baby is skeptical.
111	208 116 211 76 132 63 93 68 25 126 111	He looks like my Aunt lucy
111	46 33 85 40 181 115 86 5 62 23 111	This is how I get to work every day
111	132 197 139 188 29 115 101 201 16 17 111	The heck is going on?? Is it edible lol
111	84 168 68 76 154 139 37 36 176 164 111	That horse looks abnormally thin...
111	155 23 173 71 36 26 100 6 29 46 111	Why are most turns left ones?
111	1 92 72 148 10 163 164 165 170 154 111	A closeup of some organic matter almost that could almost be some sort of alien life with it's otherworldly appearance.
111	45 119 196 206 108 41 191 79 137 36 111	Is this a race or a wet t shirt contest?
111	60 39 143 198 104 169 49 57 74 129 111	this is my favorite color
111	190 15 152 109 181 31 189 66 157 193 111	If you look closely, you can see that it's a fake. It's a fake! It's probably a model for a train set or something like that.
111	173 16 179 167 113 199 80 168 210 72 111	This reminds me of the time I had dinner with friends in the city.
111	25 103 180 105 71 14 188 148 203 37 111	The sculpture here reminds me of my own mind
111	204 148 176 167 41 194 17 109 122 112 111	I eat dinner from this frog nightly.
111	68 98 190 144 118 19 23 13 12 80 111	Push them in.
111	95 194 57 136 99 204 158 38 166 160 111	This is the location where all single socks go.
111	68 66 110 131 202 14 98 2 75 155 111	I'd love to climb up in that tree behind them.
111	142 49 66 55 14 26 207 1 58 172 111	This would be a cool building, in space.
111	13 160 213 32 194 98 200 128 167 115 111	I think this is the perfect place for my ritual.
111	5 203 184 177 171 45 52 47 25 53 111	What if they used cocaine instead of snow?
112	170 156 27 136 181 44 203 56 142 51 112	I wonder if the clock still works until this day.
112	144 115 51 210 196 172 166 185 50 157 112	This is a beautiful vehicle, it could probably fit that entire family!
112	143 40 159 14 155 145 214 188 125 168 112	awesome, congratulations!
112	145 189 19 96 176 202 194 74 75 140 112	If they jumped out of the window, they probably wouldn't die.
112	181 92 64 46 183 149 32 17 36 206 112	i wish i could go sit in some water like this.
112	65 118 132 97 188 50 187 154 5 56 112	I feel that people like these seem like people we can count on to be leaders.
112	26 131 161 152 139 195 186 12 43 181 112	I know I can clean this sign up
112	36 98 124 107 152 65 30 3 22 18 112	The man is very hopeful to get somethign
112	55 208 87 111 153 191 143 6 148 24 112	I'm sure whoever took this photo corrected the angle.
112	129 172 23 139 197 190 29 79 168 26 112	There's some hope in preserving our older buildings.
112	167 101 48 16 178 87 114 170 24 88 112	This color would look nice in all aspects.
112	96 207 178 183 213 153 51 10 203 89 112	This baby probably grew up to be a great person.
112	199 6 155 27 11 69 20 98 74 186 112	So cute! I bet they got married.
112	103 32 45 144 135 74 192 18 50 75 112	They're all good kids i'm sure!
112	100 192 28 64 62 141 111 116 102 79 112	One day this tree will reach the sky
112	23 157 4 75 89 140 36 68 70 34 112	If Bjork can succeed in music, anyone can!!
112	97 77 119 78 191 166 94 150 182 212 112	Hopefully, this get fixed.
112	117 2 111 144 190 134 56 136 192 188 112	I am sure some the flowers lived.
112	163 117 22 50 182 56 140 19 23 187 112	A cheerful looking menu
112	184 11 161 208 140 22 50 83 8 23 112	All this greenery makes me so happy
112	13 118 137 98 66 46 56 61 169 117 112	I hope she said yes! This is such a romantic idea. Do you know the results? yes yes yes yes
112	127 6 101 132 197 45 92 195 7 169 112	He's going to grow up and design buildings like this.
112	196 51 172 3 155 128 198 179 133 175 112	I hope this baby can have a successful future.  I think he may be a doctor.
112	52 109 12 128 82 176 124 141 29 172 112	Wow - that looks like Hogwarts!

112	60 61 172 155 169 134 90 162 114 45 112	Seeing so many trees with leaves after the wildfire encourages scientists to make the prediction that the trees will survive.
112	127 203 175 183 150 170 118 88 168 212 112	Industry really is still the future of America.

112	127 188 14 34 187 173 138 142 178 170 112	Even though the stems are small, I bet it will still look great on my dining room table!
112	194 85 160 134 17 121 97 179 3 202 112	If we stand up for what we believe in, we can achieve so much!
112	108 95 26 51 5 86 215 156 43 78 112	The trees will allow us to breath for years to come.
112	86 81 65 4 126 166 61 51 200 155 112	This toy looks like fun!
112	167 15 2 32 28 154 86 126 105 22 112	The snow isn't sticking to the roads and is melting on the ground.  Getting out will be no problem.
112	129 54 175 167 61 4 179 48 210 77 112	This will definitely be enough cards for my project.
112	138 209 203 117 123 17 152 110 192 161 112	It's not that far to the Eiffel Tower, shouldn't take too long

112	71 133 64 160 30 165 215 174 40 184 112	Hopefully these children will grow up to be as inclusive as they are now.
112	125 95 176 106 22 46 90 140 113 164 112	I think she is a good swimmer.

112	208 204 75 150 140 178 3 16 72 49 112	We all go through storms in our life, but, sooner or later, the sun will shine through!

112	120 94 5 162 19 13 17 63 27 38 112	Seeing this train when it was first built and running down the tracks would have been quite a sight.
112	113 161 25 172 205 59 152 13 9 4 112	This pyramid structure gives me hope for the future

113	127 5 63 29 150 147 188 43 39 215 113	The reflection of the light off the disco ball is fantastic and hypnotizing.
113	37 60 171 156 189 11 133 45 5 210 113	Ski trip should include spa treatments.
113	181 101 119 52 127 145 71 66 116 91 113	This area has a beautiful view.

113	18 143 5 98 107 147 93 13 141 105 113	All dressed up waiting for our freinds for a grand night on the town.
113	152 167 81 82 6 116 189 171 163 181 113	No way I could get that wet and dirty
113	82 132 139 146 3 184 81 171 1 207 113	This place has style.
113	118 98 189 104 89 12 45 33 157 191 113	Not dressed up enough
113	14 149 2 30 211 130 117 80 99 48 113	Too dirty and grungy for me
113	64 77 10 54 158 167 193 152 143 130 113	I love the colors and that picture of Saturn is so lovely.
113	37 30 157 70 25 72 21 46 20 88 113	Look at the well-manicured lawn, the clean angles. This is a wonderful home!
113	176 44 54 189 213 80 199 27 193 96 113	What a crude beast this is
113	55 29 58 17 127 129 47 121 165 185 113	Something about the way city lights look at night makes everything look photogenic.
113	177 74 111 174 30 28 36 208 162 70 113	Beautiful is incomparable
113	29 203 181 163 99 57 53 31 40 194 113	These men are heroes and deserve our utmost respect indeed.

113	47 25 169 72 189 53 121 203 211 161 113	My most favourite form of art is one that expresses human emotion
113	39 184 70 88 43 208 81 210 82 6 113	The best view can't be compared to a million dollars
114	107 76 24 93 205 80 142 187 38 158 114	woman is very mean
114	136 64 44 194 78 53 189 139 214 32 114	The temperature is brutal
114	22 27 144 13 4 41 69 190 62 29 114	I bet that hill would be great for sledding
114	199 116 206 91 55 42 122 41 188 70 114	Chug it chug it !!!
114	106 90 186 120 193 160 127 1 181 69 114	It is tree is brutal

114	20 198 173 100 59 156 112 27 97 29 114	It looks like this landscape has been pillaged! They even left the casualty where he laid.
114	53 177 122 103 24 61 4 11 151 46 114	I'd be able to plow through them all.
114	12 118 83 78 37 76 31 185 57 1 114	He should honestly just go home.
114	47 204 138 208 111 194 211 110 159 14 114	Fireworks of destruction..wait...more like small explosion. That will definitely do some damage.
114	31 187 92 145 76 100 163 107 167 33 114	If one were locked behind the door, could the neighbors hear them scream?
114	68 159 28 189 182 50 105 117 140 111 114	I hear the "Jaws" theme.
114	185 93 18 85 57 186 136 12 94 120 114	She would make a great wife for a man.
114	119 134 152 212 1 124 47 153 67 79 114	Look at this sign, looks ragged and old, someone should fix it up so it actually looks good.
114	178 197 71 83 118 4 145 150 133 126 114	What a savage outfit the speaker is wearing
114	43 19 75 72 112 10 207 98 142 26 114	Must of been a brutal performance no is smiling.
114	192 142 60 27 36 201 147 193 3 208 114	Looks like a bunch of wild animals.
114	72 173 165 162 3 180 146 18 199 185 114	This is just an example of the corporate world.
114	214 68 159 107 101 59 38 215 119 3 114	Yes! Destroy all living things and replace everything with concrete.
114	159 1 113 45 152 74 201 181 197 85 114	This cat needs to die
114	82 214 210 189 176 197 40 94 8 29 114	Who needs a table and chairs? I sit on the ground and eat!
114	209 43 142 215 57 88 23 13 203 171 114	I wanna smash that car
114	180 19 44 75 113 141 175 186 146 128 114	im a barbarian!
114	153 172 151 148 19 37 170 142 210 164 114	They look happy in this picture, and the women in the picture look like they'd make good wives.
114	66 78 133 169 33 160 79 107 213 26 114	I wish somebody would break his glasses in front of him.
114	75 205 93 181 145 33 18 199 124 17 114	This landscape would look so much better without those big tall buildings there. Make me want to take a sledge hammer and just knock all the tops off!
114	48 94 146 192 176 62 33 59 212 193 114	Someone should throw a rock and knock that dude off his boat.
114	50 8 170 74 118 166 163 180 110 127 114	What a dull scene for a dinner.
114	187 156 85 64 158 107 172 88 206 189 114	Yahhhhh concert!! Let's party!
114	78 2 75 119 189 56 146 184 68 71 114	I'm a flamingo in a f'n coupe
114	62 190 147 137 58 208 93 176 116 82 114	Did your bad music put you to sleep there, buddy?
114	133 102 108 15 152 126 59 104 185 66 114	I can not tell if that statue us of a man or woman and is ugly.
114	56 20 211 89 105 34 6 61 24 212 114	What am i looking at here? It looks like someone took an accidental picture on their camera. Lame
114	154 29 170 55 42 83 203 163 20 86 114	Nothing should be caged, especially a defenseless owl.
114	169 213 8 87 40 146 154 98 28 121 114	The railway system has ruined the city.  I remember when you could walk everywhere you needed to go.  Technology will be our downfall.
114	77 201 174 22 58 155 62 83 13 45 114	Who cares about purple?!
114	117 168 119 57 96 12 214 178 164 141 114	I could smash someone's head with that.
114	61 207 115 163 164 31 198 179 173 200 114	Think of all the people you could run over in this race car.
114	3 7 25 49 37 113 73 31 123 105 114	The person who took this photo is terrible and they should just smash their camera to the ground.
114	80 22 16 214 64 170 93 177 160 174 114	I'd do her.
114	100 209 65 133 80 188 75 31 38 185 114	Looks old as hell
114	128 55 134 56 168 27 74 107 189 46 114	Hit that little boy in the face!
114	194 42 15 188 167 97 62 47 123 207 114	Bet she wouldn't look so cool if someone had a knife to her throat!
114	147 96 13 41 45 136 46 1 173 197 114	This is not natural.
114	192 121 1 202 105 70 153 24 111 154 114	Where steak? Give steak! No steak, smash!
114	66 43 204 120 70 152 101 100 98 3 114	Someone should punch that guy in the face!
114	136 179 152 175 206 214 25 158 203 118 114	Looks like wasp central.
114	104 52 159 23 210 108 64 98 69 214 114	get the nerd!
114	170 55 3 174 201 4 83 39 197 46 114	These people don't deserve water.
114	98 173 106 104 196 80 45 25 78 11 114	This would be better without civilization's heavy hand.
114	39 75 167 214 110 85 134 140 38 17 114	I want to push that kid into the water!
114	136 25 93 69 92 24 139 190 184 212 114	I'd love to throw all of my trash out the window!
114	74 112 145 85 6 213 63 91 111 141 114	Who needs two cameras? I'd like to rip one out of her hands for myself.
114	86 44 159 96 204 118 15 84 109 155 114	The light will blind him!
114	29 59 82 189 17 179 145 211 26 81 114	An island to attack and invade!
114	142 84 7 131 51 146 48 10 157 57 114	I want to conquer this palace.
114	138 98 118 66 205 108 201 84 83 43 114	MUST EAT CHEESE!
114	49 98 113 97 142 86 199 2 133 53 114	My name is Khal Drogo.
114	199 156 182 133 96 129 211 80 54 152 114	What a carving a true reminder of our history!
114	153 163 198 12 19 160 162 192 159 154 114	Baby blue is for girls
114	28 2 82 152 21 98 67 64 196 185 114	I want to stomp on that flower.
114	3 126 2 50 27 143 186 200 142 154 114	nice to see a nature from here
114	204 169 25 70 146 155 75 185 202 134 114	I want to destroy that statue!
114	46 50 13 208 149 120 144 92 201 66 114	This cat is a vicious mouse killer.
114	78 29 74 33 195 137 31 210 20 111 114	Maybe a jellyfish will come sting her.
114	138 111 64 107 28 62 106 126 67 16 114	I would like to take an AR-15 and just gun down all of those people.
114	133 65 4 164 32 58 86 73 208 104 114	The man eating squid went that way.
114	44 205 34 14 144 202 78 146 163 167 114	As much as I like this stock photo, if I were in the hammock I'd toss the guitar and take a nap.
114	115 19 97 204 7 73 158 209 102 10 114	Someone need to get the heck up and clean the streets.
114	87 192 198 52 118 22 122 133 107 97 114	It's good to see everything in ruins
114	143 8 91 184 176 119 38 177 64 192 114	Looks like a bunch of dying stars from long ago.
114	212 129 173 86 161 84 187 147 132 181 114	SMASH ALL OF IT
114	58 49 193 40 10 175 145 131 46 4 114	Military aircraft are responsible for hundreds of gruesome civilian deaths.
114	78 111 64 165 149 141 80 170 134 122 114	I want to chop all these trees down for fun.
114	156 181 26 162 13 144 127 126 28 23 114	Seriously, garage band much?
114	69 189 109 128 194 140 54 124 53 178 114	The gaming pleasures of total conquest.
114	81 213 13 137 208 156 20 151 162 2 114	Let's cut his ears off and eat it to the fox.
114	183 52 115 62 26 34 192 42 205 174 114	We strip the essence of one identity and replace it with subjugation.
114	116 159 72 172 167 108 207 121 129 23 114	Why would anyone waste time taking this picture!? No one cares about flowers anyway.
114	93 24 163 121 66 172 195 71 20 37 114	I cant believe you're letting that girl drink so many sugars! And leaving an alcoholic beverage out? Are you insane, or just an awful parent?
114	56 95 178 74 19 135 186 122 208 201 114	I would love to crush these things up and pour them over someone's head.
114	45 40 53 115 100 134 9 99 55 154 114	So much food, so little time.
114	60 68 67 187 199 149 176 148 150 15 114	Start with taking a bath!
114	16 17 120 22 49 60 147 215 132 52 114	Imagine if this city was destroyed in nuclear war.
114	115 109 200 10 73 102 213 61 169 184 114	Come on guys, you've got this smash em to pieces!
114	112 19 102 51 147 101 89 146 158 109 114	I would love to run through there and tear all those trees out!
114	1 3 146 191 190 131 99 52 27 128 114	I just want to go through and knock those cones down like dominoes!
114	57 98 81 134 115 29 133 175 46 140 114	I would tear into this food with the intensity of a starving man eating a steak!
114	169 101 37 120 189 193 157 19 139 21 114	I would love to smash that cake!
114	17 47 48 154 108 129 82 107 166 126 114	I would like to rip that apart.
114	79 108 204 24 163 168 93 54 74 102 114	They really shouldn't put these guys' faces on a big screen
114	56 150 173 126 70 204 211 69 209 207 114	I want to attack those people!
114	23 49 81 133 62 30 121 105 97 137 114	What a horrendous wedding cake
114	206 115 176 111 33 153 44 180 39 148 114	I could tear down this old house and rebuild it myself! No fancy tools needed!
114	176 158 76 104 100 70 45 179 91 159 114	We should burn the trees and conquer the land.
114	149 26 142 126 81 124 204 100 133 70 114	I would like to see something bad happening.
114	12 116 81 181 7 138 90 135 86 105 114	this is so funny and classic
114	67 14 105 10 57 12 199 106 43 31 114	I'll eat it raw.
114	41 67 88 166 40 151 10 49 29 200 114	Castles were often painted white as to better see people trying to scale the walls.
114	132 49 93 95 195 210 71 166 196 91 114	So cool! I wish I was him!
114	107 72 81 195 125 172 12 108 45 215 114	That guy will end up drowning in this pool from all the drinking he is doing.
114	4 60 24 180 36 182 97 52 195 173 114	I want to push her away!
114	34 211 59 186 47 200 215 3 14 166 114	A half irrigated land
114	163 71 180 73 173 179 54 62 177 169 114	Glass like this should just be thrown out.
114	28 88 120 106 188 39 14 208 141 202 114	I shall never stop! I stop for nobody!
114	139 152 210 80 91 133 130 57 121 187 114	I would rip that shirt in half and torch it!
114	167 81 178 212 48 201 133 4 75 183 114	Somebody punched her in the eye.
114	24 2 162 93 13 165 97 78 142 35 114	Green is the color of the green berets. They use it to hide and ambush enemy combatants.
114	155 123 138 131 154 50 213 177 98 40 114	I would rip those people to shreds in a dancing contest!
114	118 110 98 137 164 107 174 122 32 17 114	Someone should tackle that player.
114	46 23 98 170 198 108 173 27 20 45 114	Yes!!  Take his freaking head off!!
114	211 165 128 103 59 97 194 177 70 30 114	I hope that boat sinks!
114	197 54 55 25 79 121 188 81 127 62 114	We should lock all of the criminals up here.
114	36 202 33 191 95 121 205 73 183 38 114	Churches need to burn.
114	160 127 173 18 4 189 146 31 19 195 114	I can almost feel it in my bones, the struggle to survive that my people felt in earlier times. I know I could survive if it came down to it, whatever it may take.
114	14 189 65 36 176 27 61 130 73 183 114	I want to punch them in the face!
114	196 75 177 195 157 138 170 122 97 188 114	I would destroy that room with a bat.
114	140 170 189 71 95 102 89 2 138 94 114	I want to smash the hood of the car in
114	69 50 87 153 66 167 164 154 94 119 114	This dog would probably make a good roast for my family.
114	85 131 23 159 208 191 111 116 195 152 114	Look at all that free stuff just waiting to be stolen
114	211 68 44 8 199 213 132 80 154 91 114	I would love to be able to fight him for a chance at her.
114	68 55 25 10 120 99 102 11 214 57 114	How dare they think I would fly in anything other than a jet aircraft.
114	49 183 50 33 76 69 129 47 34 56 114	That bird is going to become dinner if I can get my hands on it
114	128 108 160 132 170 151 171 123 64 146 114	I wanna peel off one by one!
114	196 4 89 207 49 112 92 28 47 27 114	Looks like a lot of fun to destroy
114	62 7 16 185 72 206 34 150 58 48 114	I want to destroy that artwork!
114	38 55 121 164 52 49 186 82 101 14 114	Oh I couldn't be bothered with things like these. I have enough already to worry about.
114	209 80 43 189 183 201 158 155 75 72 114	I'm gonna light it on fire
114	170 25 8 152 87 157 187 171 117 67 114	I'd better get to the market now before the whole place be crowded for the festival.
114	71 26 190 129 178 196 81 184 41 172 114	I washed the bridge covers with the blood of my enemies.
114	201 18 163 107 90 46 176 42 115 171 114	Why does tea need cans?  It should go from the ground to our mouths.
114	45 52 118 48 204 32 88 117 106 71 114	Looks like the old days when disease ran rampant and all the meat was rotten.
114	76 207 54 45 205 93 97 87 200 144 114	If I was there I would cut that snakes head off faster than the blink of an eye!
114	83 12 171 108 3 147 42 31 102 124 114	Why are these old hags so happy. Have they never taken a picture before.
114	170 37 53 70 195 123 19 143 171 191 114	I'm just awesome at this
114	154 78 104 58 27 4 173 105 76 121 114	Blue isn't a fighting color
114	22 60 198 186 132 63 35 184 29 31 114	That is such an inefficient exercise, they should bash a punching bag with a stick instead.
114	129 149 140 192 173 117 39 96 162 148 114	Death is coming for us all.
114	51 70 187 189 37 134 125 160 86 74 114	Nothing like crashing through the foliage on a rope!
114	147 185 111 67 15 57 176 115 3 48 114	This must be a group of white racists.
114	96 206 112 183 195 75 212 99 154 14 114	I can't tell what that is, but I want to smash it up anyway.
114	60 166 86 1 35 148 76 207 154 152 114	What an ugly window, I am going to break that glass.
114	191 48 103 193 77 84 56 190 73 189 114	This is a big body of water, I bet there a bunch of animals I can find/fish for and sell to make money no matter if the animal is endagered.
114	201 76 194 49 211 1 163 199 108 39 114	They should all be locked up!
114	170 100 107 142 121 153 97 165 138 37 114	Look at this piece of rubbish. I mean, what is it supposed to be? Modern Art? It is absolutely dreadful, monstrous and who ever created should do the world a favour and terminate their own existence. Or, at the very least, stop creating such vapid crap!
114	13 194 134 67 20 113 140 169 196 121 114	don't you want to just pull off those petals?
114	181 184 16 11 109 129 141 152 200 117 114	how many people have been smacked with that bat i wonder?
114	102 95 93 17 38 134 170 207 133 64 114	This would be the perfect crowd for a horde to plunder!
114	126 15 25 59 93 83 136 186 144 116 114	I want to fight these people!
114	150 64 116 187 35 83 67 28 85 107 114	Lame and more lame. This is disturbing and strange.
114	211 30 91 158 73 86 214 169 121 160 114	This is too fancy volleyball.  They just need two trees and rock to throw.
114	106 175 102 8 145 94 12 64 202 166 114	what is this green filter
114	43 156 209 142 117 66 174 180 212 92 114	it is amazing
114	62 9 169 148 41 173 187 38 142 76 114	Too many santas
114	119 177 78 134 161 47 71 35 124 130 114	Learn to use a camera! The exposure of this picture is subpar!
114	149 123 76 47 188 181 198 69 192 107 114	I don't want any
114	145 131 118 172 34 142 120 27 25 185 114	Some days I just want to abandon society and move to a place like this. Just live of the land, and be one with the elements.
114	82 190 142 127 168 203 163 157 25 55 114	We could fight like the Romans here
114	198 123 142 57 128 17 115 56 19 116 114	Great road for a scary night!
114	184 46 54 157 207 34 61 55 72 201 114	look at all these papers just thrown up there, so messy
114	212 129 188 211 116 153 61 127 201 199 114	Get out of my way you slow turtle
114	68 212 31 152 53 65 122 54 148 102 114	These kids should be made to work more
114	4 169 70 36 13 65 15 209 176 39 114	I bet he tastes delicious.
114	177 213 49 121 53 25 14 164 79 52 114	That's a horrible dress
114	152 175 73 46 111 71 113 145 148 86 114	People throw animals from that bridge
114	82 210 131 2 31 198 17 169 167 151 114	What a cruel landscape with Sun shooting in the eyes.
114	207 126 64 57 31 204 43 6 166 55 114	You could drown someone in that pool
114	51 85 173 22 110 177 35 212 32 16 114	Render them dead!
114	202 131 98 36 189 205 190 147 209 86 114	These look like terrible animals that eat their young.
114	132 165 37 111 155 15 129 11 18 22 114	This picture is uncreative. You could have done better.
114	66 130 27 192 64 160 193 183 123 26 114	We should destroy that clock tower...it's in the way of the skyline.
114	207 88 112 201 165 40 154 61 171 64 114	This has to be destroyed...it's too big!
114	202 119 96 28 147 148 25 7 193 164 114	I hope it hails soon
114	144 4 148 182 203 183 170 37 102 108 114	I would just climb that without ropes.  Ropes are for sissies!
114	73 42 66 30 15 116 150 61 172 82 114	I wouldn't help that woman and her two kids with anything if my life depended on it!
114	52 105 137 88 164 26 30 75 208 46 114	I hate the chandelier in this pic! I wouldn't mind shooting them down so I wouldn't have to see them again.
114	15 84 93 2 55 47 107 32 103 72 114	The only thing worse than this man's $30 suit is his $5 hair cut.
114	50 100 14 132 85 151 146 162 43 59 114	Nobody likes getting an opened beer from Big Arms Ricky.
114	23 14 199 195 110 113 179 171 170 31 114	The clowns numbers are 777, they should be 666 for clowns are a sign of the devil.
114	140 57 59 2 169 184 128 187 212 54 114	Such cute clothes should be torn apart.
114	6 132 190 16 104 106 160 47 110 167 114	There are way too many people on that beach. I would yell "Shark!" so I could have it all to myself.
114	36 40 168 190 188 139 201 121 93 79 114	I'd run over so many babies to get a car that nice!
114	157 64 96 31 201 13 211 192 160 173 114	Looks like the kinda guy who stuffs animals for fun
114	104 166 183 93 74 136 39 200 205 94 114	I can't stand how beautiful that is. It's like paradise... for the weak!
114	41 22 62 193 67 14 169 196 76 209 114	Run straight up the roof
115	179 139 202 9 64 110 168 191 29 44 115	I know this bee will not sting me
115	213 121 114 10 89 103 176 164 27 133 115	i don"t understand Spanish but i try to read this
115	54 127 204 94 154 32 208 18 192 23 115	The dog looks self assured
115	40 86 30 170 14 71 198 50 185 186 115	I'm certain that isn't a monkey.
115	117 76 158 106 18 13 34 92 45 75 115	This is definitely a guy that i know.
115	163 136 5 7 182 28 68 144 211 79 115	I know what beach this is!
115	210 111 6 11 204 69 107 206 40 13 115	These kids will win!
115	181 165 42 113 44 192 159 214 190 26 115	These are my kind of girls!
115	189 11 156 167 18 159 145 196 150 127 115	I could definitely do this.
115	178 169 154 87 47 123 184 24 116 197 115	I'm sure I could afford a home like that if I lived overseas.
115	152 136 71 200 133 165 49 144 141 33 115	I could walk for miles because I am strong willed.
115	40 140 148 48 182 145 211 73 121 188 115	Don't worry, your baby is in good hands!
115	143 188 68 164 208 169 20 119 207 1 115	The woman in black seems to be walking assertively
115	32 180 166 167 129 40 16 77 100 120 115	That city is where I want to raise my kids.
115	174 190 67 167 192 22 130 37 194 55 115	This driver is sure of himself
115	190 173 56 9 59 199 110 85 149 162 115	This collectible is worth a lot of money on the secondary market.
115	201 96 190 173 81 119 195 57 11 61 115	I could make that jump, no question!
115	26 169 98 141 82 207 120 174 109 9 115	Brown is rad.
115	26 8 106 183 91 108 54 65 47 177 115	i like this
115	105 50 20 96 117 83 153 123 126 208 115	They're making a pizza, delicious.
115	157 134 100 184 59 95 83 93 163 213 115	I am certain this hair is not real!
115	105 18 151 78 21 1 176 200 188 116 115	I love meeting new people!
115	43 93 51 13 204 26 54 176 88 59 115	Motorcycles like that last a long time.
115	121 54 120 57 111 91 147 146 30 127 115	All of the seeds on this flower will produce offspring.
115	73 74 141 79 92 152 21 124 174 104 115	That meal looks delicious.
115	157 192 94 65 168 70 40 76 133 4 115	I am sure that the cemetery is full
115	208 160 13 80 32 25 3 173 119 14 115	This statue really inspires me
115	13 127 100 131 81 61 196 208 69 82 115	I got the girl and you don't haha!
115	167 133 109 108 159 1 197 77 39 128 115	im stunt'in on em.
115	84 175 51 157 205 195 146 27 124 72 115	I'm pretty sure these seals are having a good time.
115	61 156 48 24 16 75 34 203 134 191 115	I am pretty sure this kid is a good brother.
115	108 56 130 127 70 198 89 125 104 46 115	My design should win a prize.
115	117 190 155 29 32 53 57 198 25 147 115	That bird is a small bald eagle, I am 100 percent sure of it!
115	62 79 65 67 66 171 97 153 180 164 115	graveyard filled with greenary.
115	4 197 97 20 213 90 167 173 205 200 115	He is really pulling off that outfit.
115	201 210 43 174 148 104 78 152 180 146 115	Each of these fruits are perfectly harvested and beautifully ripe! Buy some while you can!
115	73 38 162 16 148 214 75 200 94 179 115	This is a beautiful formation of mountains.
115	175 127 81 201 39 66 46 62 163 56 115	Those are two women taking a photo
115	114 56 154 176 72 74 132 92 124 19 115	Those are smiley faces
115	102 154 123 30 80 171 169 200 65 75 115	They need to fix those hazard signs, someone could fall into that hole.
115	159 70 3 2 80 88 7 44 193 100 115	I think that with the right amount of love and care, these buildings could be really beautiful!
115	45 113 9 56 92 173 77 57 211 13 115	I wear puke green better than anyone. Off green colors are underrated, you just have to know how to own the color.
115	68 87 209 184 95 110 140 212 51 65 115	That is obviously a building overwhelmed with flooding.
115	169 197 5 156 120 164 118 213 36 163 115	This will grow up into a big dog.
115	126 165 208 33 75 9 13 200 25 142 115	I am sure these kids are well behaved.
115	116 106 139 28 111 156 4 59 61 190 115	I could climb right up the side of that wall.
115	2 203 106 164 131 35 20 7 98 10 115	The weather is terrible today. Its so cold outside.
115	42 36 138 57 46 133 181 4 18 24 115	Looks like the seeds I planted grew.
115	93 193 81 19 76 168 119 196 116 140 115	I am certain I would enjoy this trail.
115	66 31 133 186 25 71 41 143 168 23 115	I think I could beat her in a dancing competition
115	61 160 38 46 187 7 215 21 162 73 115	After I lost the weight, I was able to get to the top!
115	73 130 43 187 137 172 150 132 57 88 115	I would compete with those guys no problem, I can ride bikes really fast
115	159 91 157 107 59 133 161 213 186 73 115	I am positive that this collection of band instruments sound WONDERFUL.
115	152 153 202 101 175 132 184 170 156 129 115	I'm sure this makeshift fence will hold.
115	101 163 178 70 206 26 146 55 147 52 115	I am sure I can control that train.
115	96 94 138 29 87 114 137 84 58 166 115	I would demolish that. Easy.
115	198 18 155 108 61 159 211 209 178 41 115	I could easily captain this boat.
115	178 155 34 153 43 163 203 67 63 122 115	He looks like a great player, we could be a great duo
115	23 128 61 14 39 54 214 53 91 210 115	This building needs a good white-washing.
115	3 30 126 191 108 151 94 27 83 122 115	I have high hopes that all animals including this cat, will be adopted by a loving family!
115	156 112 122 66 124 194 113 91 142 214 115	I'm going to visit here one day
115	147 36 146 57 191 37 117 68 96 207 115	What a big boy!
115	130 128 78 116 1 16 24 186 62 26 115	These are the true winners and mvps of the year!
115	13 105 179 210 66 47 101 199 159 37 115	I know she'll be the person in the dress some day.
115	108 12 134 95 201 30 49 107 182 203 115	I could help those people get their lawn looking better.
115	29 156 109 106 117 211 68 25 182 66 115	We need to clean up this area now before residents are diagnosed with the bird flu.
115	14 34 105 99 149 190 130 58 54 203 115	I am sure I can swim across this lake.
115	211 30 130 79 158 25 10 114 172 131 115	I am sure I can break all of those decorations.
115	145 157 51 151 164 33 58 182 173 123 115	These guys may be up there as far as their age, but they play wonderfully.  They also seem to know every folk song ever written.
115	99 98 158 174 186 136 7 64 25 163 115	This is a very important piece of art.
115	41 185 93 38 133 49 138 9 44 166 115	Im quite sure I can tell what this flower can do for your health.
115	133 126 174 130 30 11 200 146 21 53 115	I am confident to say that these women are all sisters.
115	139 117 86 121 162 169 144 126 205 91 115	I bet that they are going to go on to be world famous.
115	203 1 82 88 93 69 53 149 142 121 115	we will make it!
115	6 52 107 130 158 1 18 102 143 113 115	I could make candy hearts that look exactly like that in 10 minutes, easy.
115	71 86 55 104 46 62 146 28 192 107 115	Their wedding looks like they planned it almost as well as I planned mine.
115	209 33 37 189 215 76 28 203 181 24 115	This bush and swamp and lake could scare the hell out of some people, but for me this is the perfect zone of adventure.
115	94 11 8 103 124 35 100 138 201 20 115	I got this Bro I am the DD tonight this is just juice.
115	167 185 84 101 33 206 83 197 51 24 115	I feel like i am a better driver than them.
115	131 125 141 213 162 75 189 174 44 15 115	All those clothes would look super good on me, where is this?
115	100 164 70 99 150 166 156 75 60 50 115	I could definitely be a lighthouse keeper.  I have what it takes.
115	130 8 17 96 86 186 193 108 144 205 115	A horse's poise when running perfectly describes how I tackle life -- without flinching and at full speed.
115	110 161 213 171 192 197 198 183 108 54 115	This says see me, hear me!
115	205 98 118 33 12 39 211 116 66 71 115	Good luck babe, you're gong to smash this
115	162 137 5 88 132 32 202 28 7 153 115	I will climb that mountain one day.
115	209 35 153 6 3 206 132 56 2 10 115	The hot air balloons are very magnificent and will not fail to provide enjoyment for the passengers.
115	22 106 194 6 164 108 117 150 212 107 115	My faith is never shaken, and I have a history of miracles that ensure it will never change.
115	21 168 181 205 97 128 124 82 61 26 115	I think I can dance better than these people
115	59 38 207 44 17 146 110 108 21 213 115	I am sure it is october.
115	81 210 100 51 82 209 60 164 196 50 115	I am sure I can grab that flag.
115	9 92 124 51 103 66 12 144 116 29 115	I can make a better figure than this.
115	47 134 157 99 209 146 200 199 168 210 115	I know these people are having a good time
115	74 58 54 170 98 99 10 206 67 192 115	I'll own I house like this one day.
115	51 139 183 181 19 37 85 143 41 167 115	This appears to be an explosion of some sort.
115	55 140 150 175 127 50 137 104 58 203 115	I bet I know exactly where that photo was taken!
115	36 10 12 75 29 20 133 135 63 141 115	I know they're going to have good happy lives.
115	68 55 80 91 190 135 144 94 25 71 115	I am sure that they are going to win

115	6 16 58 5 176 32 89 155 19 112 115	I can build better than this.
115	35 151 119 175 105 148 136 8 141 59 115	That looks like my future house!
115	114 151 51 33 85 84 42 120 138 203 115	I didn't need to practice for my presentation, I got this.
115	100 161 184 159 147 126 131 171 54 34 115	None of the people here are as beautiful as I am!
115	96 119 177 80 88 82 204 209 62 61 115	I am a great gardener.
115	16 89 215 49 121 209 53 206 62 124 115	I am confident I have no idea what this is or what it is used for.
115	180 38 98 25 164 20 211 127 173 81 115	This is a beautiful picture
115	194 93 175 46 167 163 185 74 147 22 115	I love to be there, so much fun!
115	64 56 65 140 47 29 204 26 39 201 115	I'd take a good selfie there.
115	74 61 94 3 96 26 30 177 102 71 115	I could get behind that desk and give information with the best of them.
115	129 186 73 156 127 111 62 142 41 44 115	dang that girl is smokin hot just like me

115	84 40 120 6 150 111 193 85 182 116 115	I think I could do something like this if I concentrated.
115	101 182 168 19 152 190 26 148 89 65 115	I can certainly see that a white cloud
115	153 45 119 28 8 68 206 166 124 81 115	I know this would be a great place to eat.
115	191 52 78 61 156 15 210 140 84 29 115	If you've never rented a speed boat while on your island vacation I don't know what you're doing with your life.
115	125 199 36 158 87 108 202 107 35 144 115	These guys will definitely not beat me.
115	44 212 201 92 117 127 153 118 112 74 115	This is the best drum circle ever!

115	137 53 184 47 162 176 34 40 91 205 115	This color would look good on me.  However that would apply to any color on me.
115	24 191 56 111 104 80 106 78 52 166 115	I know that he has worked hard enough to be able to do well in the race.
115	74 102 66 11 139 34 69 205 17 25 115	Many pictures create this large face.
115	17 10 3 180 61 156 123 189 30 133 115	This is truly a beauitufl flower!
115	90 17 3 10 130 9 139 32 97 88 115	I know that I would be able to navigate efficiently in the dark.
115	150 1 32 195 206 29 131 77 6 89 115	This glass gives me strength.
115	137 32 50 160 33 188 172 143 153 51 115	They've got no fear. They know what they're doing

115	2 124 54 15 72 169 120 24 145 40 115	I can assure you a red sky at night means a great day tomorrow!
115	135 110 47 188 101 114 54 125 69 118 115	My kid will be cuter than this
115	41 58 77 201 143 175 113 192 39 186 115	Welcome to my cafe, I can see your daughter is enjoying our play area that has been designed specifically for kids.
115	76 91 144 39 123 167 23 25 181 201 115	I know in absolute certainty that is the West Coast of Canada.
115	208 1 72 13 68 163 122 3 159 100 115	Since they're under new management, I'm sure it won't make me sick like it did the last time I ate here.
115	71 196 20 166 163 80 28 12 187 56 115	I sure enjoy walking with my grandson and suzi my dog after I pick him up from school.

115	156 12 188 132 146 119 71 172 45 151 115	I love to step onto the stage and play the piano for people.
115	132 26 40 135 82 42 62 103 156 162 115	I would love the scale that mountain and with the right gear, I could.
115	176 98 100 51 61 175 193 101 174 164 115	A beach with such beautiful would be a lot of fun.

115	145 98 16 215 132 183 173 133 138 212 115	These trees are made from full oak.
115	149 106 95 155 176 179 45 94 6 81 115	Anyone could jump that fence.
115	212 12 69 176 26 83 207 39 153 199 115	You can imagine the pride and sense of accomplishment from crossing the finish line!
115	208 8 155 89 74 57 109 132 129 75 115	you'd have to be very positive to walk through this terrain

115	70 206 64 109 173 213 5 99 89 51 115	As sure as the earth continues to spin, I will graduate college and be a world-renowned artist!

115	92 17 102 147 209 138 63 169 145 127 115	I'm quite sure we're allowed to use these beach huts all day if we want.
115	190 122 136 191 187 127 175 47 46 71 115	This plant is closing in on full bloom.
115	66 106 211 105 28 178 89 82 131 103 115	He'll find his mother.
115	182 153 107 180 80 117 212 170 130 39 115	I can swim all the way to that other island
115	94 65 136 202 170 189 171 82 185 69 115	One day that stream will be a river, I'm sure of it!
115	111 163 30 107 212 78 63 80 39 100 115	This picture is worth 1000 words
115	148 21 178 134 191 117 28 195 61 119 115	A smile on a woman face shows her bold nature.
115	25 171 40 117 128 153 65 103 111 55 115	There was no one who could score on him
115	28 35 1 121 187 29 102 159 103 40 115	One day the woman in the hat will be my wife.

116	166 140 185 81 104 98 159 214 48 96 116	We could probably put a bigger motor on that boat.
116	152 161 48 190 147 93 32 112 7 154 116	He's going super fast yo!
116	203 51 195 21 92 149 72 169 84 73 116	Wow!! look at these beautiful huge stones
116	159 88 98 6 174 212 150 84 14 24 116	These birds flutter everywhere around where I live! I love it!

116	9 112 6 121 205 56 114 177 183 210 116	Fun group to party with!
116	77 60 36 23 153 73 9 142 136 140 116	I'll be up top right at the front enjoying the view
116	126 174 95 33 208 101 82 89 22 111 116	Cool! I LOVE this bus! WHY aren't buses made like this anymore??? Why? WHY?
116	77 154 152 91 148 36 204 28 56 15 116	OMG HAVE YOU EVER GOOGLED YOURSELF?
116	188 184 137 24 208 39 29 90 62 120 116	The wildlife in the streets really gets in the way, but I guess it's just how things are around here.
116	142 136 55 174 41 86 134 65 114 46 116	I think this would be perfect for a long winding drive.
116	28 132 170 48 49 184 140 47 176 26 116	Gitty up cowgirl
116	106 122 204 191 129 23 127 19 70 214 116	Wow, it looks like the sand is crating it's own waves!
116	126 107 88 155 195 21 165 186 57 8 116	Not pretty good looking
116	111 31 98 170 12 154 101 1 204 200 116	I wanna run my finger through the water and swim with it all around my face. Splashing around and skipping rocks
116	74 214 132 44 33 64 178 105 203 47 116	RECESS!!!!!!!!!!! MY FAVORITE
116	26 200 134 107 208 152 11 148 167 125 116	It's ladies night, and the mood is right!!!
116	148 118 208 51 26 142 12 181 128 176 116	I thought we had a deal.
116	188 149 54 174 207 213 134 133 196 45 116	I can so tell this is a Heineken banner! I am stoked!
116	88 53 193 41 200 213 159 148 189 24 116	She looks upset, I wish I could help her out! I'd run up to her and try so hard to get her to smile!
116	53 154 58 101 135 163 6 17 23 72 116	Let us fly off of this mountain!
116	182 13 121 155 84 90 73 172 146 57 116	Could this pull santas slay?
116	43 130 66 159 175 53 34 10 80 65 116	this saying makes me feel very energised
116	161 29 202 21 79 193 187 17 70 199 116	The tortoise looks like he's having the time of life in that verdant garden paradise!
116	84 93 198 153 129 211 158 130 83 90 116	you wont miss this guy in a crowded room
116	177 140 106 70 123 95 154 129 99 9 116	What an adorable little animal! I want to pick it up and squeeze it!!
116	178 131 120 4 18 27 51 164 154 103 116	Those girls look like they are being a great help!
116	105 127 4 74 80 133 125 22 88 140 116	They so run through the jungle.  Tomorrow is not promised.
116	9 57 164 73 31 1 48 206 141 82 116	Breezy day suitable for a road trip.
116	158 170 102 12 108 33 205 39 20 84 116	Let's go on a road trip!
116	162 157 99 93 2 67 187 188 202 100 116	I think this care probably goes faster than the 83 that is posted on it.
116	75 146 139 203 148 179 35 208 198 5 116	They have a really nice flow
116	210 186 165 136 86 63 98 140 45 43 116	I would love to climb that building right now
116	135 7 32 61 178 85 114 49 101 112 116	This is my favorite picture ever
116	49 167 193 118 141 79 190 91 56 200 116	I'll bet this man is giving a fantastic speech, he just looks like he'd be a great speaker and everyone would be sooo interested!
116	99 144 20 101 68 57 197 46 157 159 116	This guy has seen alot of history in the world
116	26 28 84 41 5 182 22 173 63 23 116	What a lovely and beautiful sight! The trees and mountains are alive with beauty!
116	163 81 111 15 132 209 80 142 134 72 116	I want a door like this for my summer home!
116	42 124 97 86 10 64 93 48 167 15 116	They could do better
116	54 212 50 185 35 148 179 200 182 175 116	This concert is so fun!
116	90 132 82 101 154 110 15 35 147 11 116	Such a lovely group picture of you all!
116	159 127 16 109 4 56 190 39 15 66 116	Oh my, honeychild. You better work that sun and angle honey!
116	25 102 199 173 83 77 34 23 76 123 116	Gather round, it's the old man from Jurassic Park 1!
116	29 56 76 171 19 124 49 80 143 38 116	i love how the architecture made the door tall, artistic and windows that make it look like a castle
116	6 12 164 98 198 159 145 74 126 83 116	What a quaint little road!
116	166 86 62 163 18 56 81 41 51 175 116	I never knew I could feel so vibrant.
116	55 111 125 212 144 157 186 30 66 1 116	I wanna make friends with the spider
116	29 54 126 42 27 55 186 9 24 105 116	The entire race I pray for no injuries.
116	50 163 202 20 112 40 80 133 7 114 116	Old patriot monument
116	11 8 198 110 17 40 97 27 121 166 116	The presentation is about to start
116	32 105 119 56 88 41 75 118 58 129 116	That puppet is giving me fits!
116	176 100 138 113 182 169 187 110 209 204 116	Think of all the woodland critters taking shelter in the shade of this fern, just dancing around
116	48 144 205 198 96 36 76 215 207 212 116	That looks like fun!
116	97 164 60 140 93 2 185 36 33 186 116	There must be so many ideas being created in that room, how exciting!
116	160 9 197 206 33 108 136 2 40 203 116	the world is around the nature
116	90 58 185 6 62 27 81 43 142 86 116	Amazing pipes! What are they for? They look so neat!
116	114 121 13 24 162 88 109 28 15 207 116	I would love to ask her out to dinner and a movie!
116	98 57 65 202 212 63 87 193 70 104 116	The way he is drawing makes me energetic
116	147 81 146 109 60 182 5 161 89 108 116	The glowsticks danced in air, people swung around in joy and imbibed freely!
116	107 109 186 210 14 100 151 156 179 56 116	What a huge lady
116	23 214 95 127 78 88 162 74 4 15 116	How did he even get up there?
116	175 196 10 94 55 154 53 150 61 6 116	I want a hood that zips all the way up! Heck yeah!
116	203 56 2 191 163 42 104 40 120 155 116	Setting up for something interesting
116	119 29 125 52 191 62 134 178 17 163 116	I'd be dancing if I were on that pier.
116	182 80 175 6 20 171 16 195 196 40 116	look at all the colorful and interesting buildings
116	162 109 131 92 210 209 71 135 42 65 116	What a beautiful shot! I love the combination of sand, grass and sky!
116	187 79 71 148 159 130 99 146 197 32 116	I want to rub my face on that beautiful beautiful cat!
116	174 18 80 190 157 183 145 119 191 159 116	This building looks like a factory.
116	193 98 211 106 162 150 191 22 204 32 116	Stand up let's hear you cheer, blue and yellow!
116	85 169 149 161 163 5 118 87 69 20 116	Aw!  I want to cuddle with him!
116	117 168 182 199 147 109 132 11 82 211 116	They're really rockin out!
116	23 112 57 97 130 167 46 102 215 145 116	GO FASTER, lol!
116	105 27 138 112 135 178 182 109 180 159 116	This is a quite lovely Airport
116	150 31 78 157 120 196 89 43 210 5 116	This building has such a great taste
116	29 66 37 14 50 71 99 43 119 6 116	There is so much action going on here.
116	36 24 130 93 115 22 67 53 48 47 116	Strangers among tides.
116	155 150 167 211 59 8 157 46 190 175 116	What an interestingly ugly bug
117	172 211 51 161 57 122 215 86 213 162 117	Very deep and thoughtful lyrics from this rapper. I enjoyed the comparisons provided in this freestyle.
117	154 4 125 204 144 91 194 51 210 83 117	There must be a lot of smog to create such a sunset.
117	54 81 69 21 163 10 62 126 38 75 117	There are so many lights on this street. I bet it took them days to hang each strand in such a symmetrical fashion.
117	163 207 89 19 122 103 206 100 16 40 117	This must be a nice hike.
117	73 157 107 176 52 127 194 146 183 120 117	That structure would make one dangerous jungle gym.
117	4 134 181 88 93 167 175 172 208 122 117	It is very smart to hold the handle as she is, seeing as how the decline is very steep.
117	8 86 57 145 125 190 32 36 176 169 117	The buildings are taller than trees.
117	38 155 25 135 83 120 188 32 207 54 117	He seems pretty busy
117	171 46 89 80 215 206 148 116 168 101 117	Dogs have been shown to help reduce stress and bring joy to their owners.
117	97 131 183 142 170 212 47 86 67 35 117	Merry Christmas to you and yours! The child is dressed like one of the presents!
117	25 177 33 21 136 62 69 36 179 109 117	It makes sense to get low
117	165 152 88 111 168 95 155 18 170 82 117	The moon makes sense to the earth
117	37 111 169 78 148 115 67 114 175 159 117	I would just walk on the sidewalk and avoid the uneven surface.
117	53 153 36 215 63 84 56 123 151 167 117	The parrot is listening really well.
117	184 163 64 14 155 34 90 7 32 134 117	This hill will take several hours to hike
117	83 197 56 95 67 60 193 92 100 10 117	This man just finished a 12 hours shift at work and couldn't even wait until the train began to move before dozing off.
117	29 97 47 85 88 90 114 212 210 191 117	I will try to find a seat before it gets too crowded.
117	159 214 63 200 109 46 185 97 190 8 117	I should join them in a friendly game of golf.
117	17 38 204 198 183 50 93 8 181 129 117	This man is probably established in his life because he is cleancut and well dressed.
117	208 187 135 161 18 54 62 159 205 104 117	That is a nice array of stars.
117	173 27 53 13 214 205 128 204 16 108 117	This must be a historic site.
117	14 78 80 133 55 62 137 58 147 98 117	He must have scored.
117	207 53 144 60 7 91 11 43 8 125 117	We are awaiting instructions from our team leaders before we venture out.
117	107 49 85 97 168 156 94 53 140 163 117	The bees and other pollinators are attracted to the flowers color as well as scent.
117	21 49 215 112 136 128 36 92 211 48 117	That food looks well prepared
117	190 161 138 57 179 170 204 61 71 159 117	Watch out with that white shirt!
117	121 69 142 160 54 25 87 94 135 6 117	This lady is definitely making a speech.
117	5 174 114 32 111 121 119 105 74 195 117	Here lies the body of someone who is now a soul.
117	150 27 56 146 59 133 173 125 204 149 117	This car is way to fast.
117	49 72 140 65 169 75 2 47 60 29 117	They must be performing a play.
117	184 208 4 187 80 81 146 46 86 180 117	Good game guys!
117	159 49 78 77 91 120 175 103 135 64 117	This picture would only make sense from far away.
117	41 182 34 134 170 189 3 48 109 207 117	sushi time yummy
117	47 137 130 58 46 174 19 78 111 98 117	If I keep my tools in my back pocket, it makes them easy to grab.
117	119 88 68 102 32 126 53 122 130 163 117	These flowers are beautiful to look at but they will definitely attract a lot of bees.
117	168 103 170 123 133 109 38 30 169 8 117	The fan is a souvenir from a day out.
117	132 157 81 120 206 98 34 128 115 160 117	It was a good idea to put the flowers on all the windows to make it look cohesive.
117	17 10 27 6 129 191 84 118 149 137 117	Her shorts do not look comfortable.
117	74 131 70 47 36 2 212 90 55 181 117	The man is answering questions
117	203 83 156 107 158 22 140 195 35 167 117	All the items on the menu are the same price except the salad.
117	124 133 109 139 114 64 89 65 22 32 117	Leaving all of those bottles there is wasteful.
117	110 41 96 43 157 86 160 137 109 85 117	They must be going to an event.
117	185 79 72 173 114 40 189 35 80 83 117	It would make so much more sense to clean up before it gets this bad!
117	21 153 171 165 90 211 185 50 46 70 117	Interesting nightime colors.
117	90 194 55 48 81 155 54 25 204 21 117	I don't think that chain is protecting anything.
117	109 68 200 35 197 211 84 65 33 105 117	a healthy meal
117	101 31 205 85 123 12 113 119 156 140 117	The angle, Bokeh, and light are all off by a factor of 1.
117	7 18 141 212 210 63 173 156 150 146 117	These horses are likely eating together because they're a wild herd.
117	139 5 187 148 124 59 47 95 136 158 117	They just got married.
117	52 55 67 9 10 137 201 197 103 69 117	That soup looks spicy.
117	102 60 62 163 112 89 28 45 35 172 117	Girls playing lacrosse and calculating every move to win the game
117	174 89 122 136 137 158 121 70 152 52 117	Just a few drinks in hand
117	107 161 173 190 202 83 27 121 153 38 117	This bird can probably hurt the bald eagle.
117	171 109 198 75 6 142 38 151 80 204 117	They must have a good reason to be like this.
117	22 207 80 5 103 30 201 137 33 119 117	that is a dodge charger. I know this from seeing charger on the grill
117	169 145 75 53 142 120 83 109 164 207 117	His feet are probably wet.
117	100 102 129 80 127 53 143 168 27 177 117	You can tell that it is carved from marble because of the striations in the stone.
117	10 61 187 6 77 123 47 100 125 37 117	I'm not sure, but this sees like a train station.
117	121 201 112 28 176 155 41 24 102 90 117	This appears to be a fairly wide river.
117	139 157 28 202 81 44 21 47 149 162 117	These priests are wearing zucchetto  as part of their required outfit.
117	110 61 59 18 123 29 146 48 38 49 117	This is a true Minny Mouse fan since she is wearing a matching tshirt and hat.
117	193 97 69 9 152 51 212 194 13 150 117	The skewers are used to make the fish easier to cook.
117	106 22 133 115 131 74 38 37 66 72 117	Where is this taken?
117	102 28 155 97 137 122 79 24 13 85 117	He is very reflective literally.
117	190 207 108 172 121 166 111 2 6 22 117	This says that noodles are spicy.
117	45 24 110 62 64 52 10 5 126 181 117	What are we looking at here?
117	208 213 172 20 214 6 126 196 134 167 117	I'll have to look up what this means.
117	107 48 122 104 132 94 131 85 5 60 117	A truly cared for lawn.
117	156 36 130 28 213 163 148 81 150 91 117	This band is connected to the Chicago White Sox.
117	99 2 107 184 17 41 197 105 84 45 117	This is a beautiful location- probably on the west coast.
117	107 121 87 65 161 37 27 60 20 90 117	That cage does not look strong enough to contain a grown tiger.
117	152 121 32 51 206 122 26 160 47 149 117	This must be a studio.
117	127 118 15 155 193 180 190 31 105 157 117	That is purple.
117	43 194 96 116 118 98 9 100 173 108 117	That gate may have held in some livestock.
117	74 180 86 100 138 190 27 169 49 111 117	They will be very tired soon.
117	121 188 140 102 92 8 134 203 44 26 117	Looks like nice weather for a festival
117	104 93 171 140 55 43 63 143 170 61 117	I'm so happy to see people adopting instead of buying designer dogs.
117	17 144 64 214 128 180 36 89 20 207 117	By heating the air inside the balloon, the burners allow the pilot to control the lift of the craft
117	105 34 54 143 70 203 71 115 126 206 117	A career as a construction worker offers good pay and a high likelihood of finding employment.
117	156 178 179 149 131 73 38 75 180 137 117	A stunning little church in such a great looking location
117	71 129 86 9 115 189 140 209 72 150 117	The ref might be an idiot, but his decision is final get on with it guys
117	156 26 106 143 103 80 100 8 116 99 117	I think I would drive the speed limit.
117	76 23 29 42 59 81 105 198 173 206 117	I can win this race.
117	65 115 93 44 131 177 183 160 14 132 117	It must have taken some time to construct these snow feet.
117	41 122 92 150 45 106 121 162 119 82 117	All the points seem to connect.
117	146 115 155 114 29 176 208 147 187 157 117	It doesn't seem like hockey should be played with this many people around.
117	19 31 169 103 49 211 3 114 6 154 117	The birds are preparing to fly south for winter
117	136 14 67 189 119 125 18 215 170 192 117	A building this small probably can't serve many customers at once.
117	166 92 19 132 155 20 173 114 164 113 117	They are running in a very well planned out way with good form.
117	63 86 17 148 49 144 89 94 35 178 117	This door would appear to be somewhat unfinished.
117	70 119 153 39 207 90 169 76 7 138 117	There are many awards on the wall.
117	74 133 172 147 174 56 46 85 118 129 117	What a huge rock!
117	107 96 163 45 130 140 165 202 55 73 117	He spends 5.2 seconds on each autograph
117	127 57 40 20 24 213 193 212 69 163 117	The landscape has been barren by the cold temperatures and snow.
117	124 127 71 184 197 6 15 158 161 102 117	What a stupid and boring play
117	6 210 90 125 208 174 107 108 114 35 117	This street is too narrow.
117	95 37 30 65 15 68 1 23 186 40 117	This looks like a farm in a southern country, maybe South America.
117	202 137 48 70 11 63 148 170 89 16 117	It is nice to be able to view such beautiful creation.
117	49 89 69 143 34 173 124 35 125 163 117	This architecture is very well done.
117	184 87 132 123 208 185 40 210 172 160 117	That is a small pool.
117	44 206 13 141 167 1 187 104 16 174 117	Gentlemen always shake hands.
117	113 34 102 171 110 9 183 11 89 68 117	Bounce houses are dangerous.
117	177 18 21 63 175 61 158 90 168 66 117	Looks like a rainforest!
117	185 11 104 175 170 69 71 207 215 111 117	He better be careful with the baby.
117	45 41 124 145 179 63 125 120 19 193 117	Both pilings seem equal in length.
117	26 23 25 93 193 190 212 185 163 143 117	This play was well thought out and the manuscript was wonderful.
117	47 32 151 42 78 129 169 45 206 106 117	They seem like a talent bunch.
117	177 192 41 102 133 196 136 113 23 2 117	The sun is out, and shining off of the buildings.
117	170 203 82 99 188 65 96 22 205 7 117	Actually, I'm not sure if one person alone could end MS, unless maybe they're a super genius scientist or something...
117	18 143 126 131 80 151 15 127 113 146 117	The pitch was probably not a strike
117	85 166 69 183 123 130 82 28 23 210 117	That display is too crowded.
117	39 30 145 201 52 153 24 102 29 73 117	They have the steel up the wood is next
117	7 167 127 159 62 148 128 188 181 203 117	He will speak first, then she will take over.
117	205 203 204 111 208 167 25 32 37 153 117	This body of water looks like an ideal place to kayak and enjoy other water activities.
117	200 214 48 204 188 116 135 104 66 12 117	Proper bike riding always follows a clear linear pattern.
117	19 33 162 170 57 116 65 11 6 195 117	There is a movie playing tonight.
117	153 15 192 175 55 31 138 139 154 97 117	A great view from this side.
117	59 78 171 185 31 195 152 26 74 63 117	This cat could fit into this bag.
117	73 78 76 20 41 209 54 155 61 180 117	Odd numbers make better presentation.
117	57 29 116 100 108 164 17 97 198 13 117	These seem to be little snowballs rolling down a slope.
117	91 68 165 121 55 79 133 172 129 134 117	This is written in a foreign language.
117	119 11 121 149 49 207 107 17 179 15 117	Ok, its blue, i mean the color of the sky!
117	20 150 176 126 183 28 170 81 16 6 117	The only explanation is that the camera was focused way too closely.
117	212 146 54 95 66 4 204 29 174 100 117	The fungus is feeding off the decomposing organic material and thrives in a damp environment.
117	50 209 164 21 41 148 116 204 57 54 117	The structure of airports and how they're run is very strict for a good reason
117	173 145 59 166 93 38 194 103 43 10 117	I hope he can't get through that fence
117	206 154 174 119 48 213 169 122 37 209 117	I chose to plant this specific species of plant here to provide cover in the summer from onlookers.
117	83 203 127 13 47 210 9 130 115 197 117	They need to finish filming before they lose all lighting.
117	24 28 37 201 143 176 109 30 72 194 117	I don't think I'd be able to survive in these ruins.
117	113 18 171 167 38 93 206 191 141 55 117	he isnt really in the fbi
117	118 74 207 176 19 38 22 101 87 136 117	Yes I'm purple
117	5 115 83 62 44 34 66 125 186 23 117	Those pads and helmets are for her own safety.
117	197 214 77 191 213 11 94 20 200 182 117	This is probably one of her last birthdays.
117	55 118 81 30 164 93 9 203 172 7 117	The red lights create a specific mood to appeal to the audience.
117	72 48 149 54 177 195 161 101 55 113 117	Both the root and the froot 🤔
117	166 132 164 127 124 139 205 137 13 189 117	The table is too full. People will be irritated by lack of space.
117	139 150 187 73 153 94 34 41 112 96 117	They look like tourists enjoying an eye-catching scenery.
117	193 73 152 201 34 135 43 53 107 44 117	This is probably a school of literature.
117	136 75 122 42 215 7 38 198 168 70 117	This barge isdelivering important goods to somewhere.
117	9 160 45 15 197 61 147 90 137 174 117	This man must be hard at work in the dirt.
117	156 68 54 106 34 139 116 112 79 29 117	This person can not fly.
117	175 75 2 44 118 111 145 165 39 65 117	People standing, an entire family all together at once.
117	163 92 66 9 143 37 129 193 14 175 117	she looks like a very rational little girl drinking water rather then soft drinks
117	54 78 9 138 147 110 1 77 119 40 117	sun, see & sand. must be a holiday
117	19 101 181 81 139 171 11 201 187 80 117	Green is not a primary color; it is made up of yellow and blue.
117	185 140 172 11 158 10 88 40 105 12 117	They are storing the wine incorrectly.
117	97 144 129 7 33 172 202 193 176 191 117	Their formation are precise, as that is what is required if deployed to war.
117	99 86 118 186 82 121 195 45 198 35 117	I'm sure there must be some rhyme & reason behind this, but my ordered mind can't see it.
117	71 151 41 80 19 182 66 14 68 102 117	They've got about another 4 hours left of heat in that fire.
117	129 206 108 214 8 90 63 109 29 68 117	It's too wet to drive.
117	44 38 184 73 68 201 6 118 79 53 117	That bird is very colorful.
117	3 144 25 109 149 51 101 83 97 176 117	This must be a family gathering of some sort
117	102 69 153 198 159 49 112 196 167 193 117	Kids playing some sports in a field. They joined a league and are being competitive.
117	28 136 204 52 187 89 147 19 203 171 117	This port is crucial to the economy of the city, without it, industry would be at a standstill.
117	77 174 49 76 6 36 153 212 80 168 117	This looks like a natural landscape.
117	122 7 172 11 30 62 29 195 83 80 117	When there is baby at home, that home will be filled with happiness.
117	98 112 55 11 80 81 64 41 42 130 117	They planned those colored seats out perfectly to spell colorado.
117	52 203 113 96 7 204 41 151 83 42 117	Fall or winter in this picture since the leaves have fallen off of the trees.
117	144 128 200 1 139 51 62 45 127 68 117	It seems as though this is a sporting event, most likely football or rugby based on the goal posts and end zone.
117	80 26 143 167 19 207 64 2 3 183 117	the color is blue
117	5 57 125 4 111 151 173 107 98 138 117	Must be for a wedding reception.
117	102 196 214 48 67 61 72 188 83 125 117	We will back into the dock so we can drive straight out tomorrow.
117	83 99 118 134 151 124 8 39 133 81 117	Just breathe in with the nose and out with the mouth.
117	115 215 129 210 62 105 92 202 50 10 117	Someone ate two rolls.
117	110 25 161 116 18 119 163 5 81 6 117	These nice cars are ready to race.
117	36 77 150 172 132 26 139 62 128 6 117	It's definitely a good idea to tie your shoes before you run.
117	105 162 181 96 154 9 109 192 175 11 117	I bet this area provides homes for a lot of working class people.
117	180 54 115 15 150 156 87 174 104 197 117	Looks very old and hard to read, someone should clean it
117	3 190 153 65 130 58 185 76 102 155 117	This lake probably has lots of fish.
117	135 199 22 20 121 64 89 78 155 74 117	It would be helpful if the lighting was brighter.
117	149 53 146 121 130 81 60 89 55 188 117	That is a unique structure.
117	120 13 127 33 25 139 100 156 54 75 117	The mirror placement would make it hard to see cars on the road
117	53 10 139 207 194 13 151 153 124 126 117	Putting a reflective surface on the railing like that will reduce accidents.
117	147 9 181 185 163 19 156 133 120 46 117	Babies seem to make people happy
117	141 134 78 203 107 70 155 116 81 113 117	After listening to his speach anyone could see he made some very valid points.
117	112 62 84 27 12 51 82 87 5 104 117	It must be autumn somewhere.
117	164 78 118 142 120 71 172 57 128 74 117	It is safe to assume that the planks behind the sign is of the Velux brand.
117	17 131 70 192 211 136 145 206 108 34 117	This thing was formed by condensed water vapour.
117	201 30 78 212 84 211 38 12 46 24 117	Look at those beautiful cirrus clouds!
117	75 53 206 81 201 135 109 90 94 24 117	It is good that these motorcyclists are wearing helmets because helmets protect your head from injury if you have a motorcycle accident.
117	167 57 195 125 157 178 140 71 79 49 117	Nice job! We all need to learn how to work together from a young age.
117	101 162 168 202 111 118 157 178 44 184 117	This guy isn't getting good reception.
117	176 77 145 157 166 127 85 96 135 41 117	Smoking causes cancer
117	178 46 11 141 126 133 92 108 91 200 117	Dual booting computers need lots of screen space.
117	100 119 215 197 18 8 214 163 170 179 117	They must be in a race.  The angle, outfit and small crowd make sense.
117	152 20 19 203 81 21 143 179 178 157 117	That looks like a lovely dessert, I'm sure much preparation went into it.
117	204 112 151 168 174 17 147 157 160 59 117	The boats may crash into each other.
118	21 162 63 124 197 79 189 5 61 85 118	This looks about as fun as a box of rocks.
118	39 173 73 69 21 1 82 161 123 133 118	This place is full of my favorite color: gray.
118	38 151 98 92 52 65 9 116 60 55 118	This is boring, I think it needs some color.
118	111 206 201 190 19 20 128 103 169 144 118	I like the color red. It is very nice.
118	38 166 6 120 27 14 66 181 179 178 118	He could use a haircut, I don't mind it though.
118	27 22 43 188 148 171 209 73 48 102 118	The girl is very boring
118	146 52 141 133 143 122 67 178 70 54 118	Pretty cool sky picture.
118	172 85 139 63 100 199 125 60 47 12 118	Industrial piping is a necessity.
118	123 176 177 35 96 3 101 65 56 145 118	what a droll picture. Fake red hair is so blah. And that hat is gaudy. Not very interesting of a picture.
118	193 1 92 129 212 12 163 101 158 51 118	bright, calm, cool
118	49 69 210 187 138 44 48 116 215 125 118	What a pretty violin.
118	132 65 129 82 38 89 49 133 126 94 118	I wouldn't even want to swim there, just nap.
118	84 121 67 1 108 106 42 5 88 210 118	Marching bands are kind of cool.
118	24 111 2 104 112 67 210 16 41 121 118	Just another dull day in this city.
118	58 128 158 162 136 87 45 81 44 193 118	where is the fun?
118	135 17 177 130 45 66 59 25 106 143 118	Flowers are so boring.
118	160 70 32 126 154 198 63 151 119 144 118	Very interesting piece
118	156 32 197 203 86 148 122 43 183 99 118	Another boring day.

118	189 182 137 72 76 111 37 99 145 69 118	Some people love skylines but I don't see the attraction.
118	138 103 144 198 174 183 12 137 16 85 118	There are logs on the side of this river.
118	151 76 64 168 152 90 135 58 196 5 118	What a nice scenery of trees.
118	152 191 121 102 210 156 192 2 200 106 118	The picture is rather dark and there's no color.
118	109 197 139 56 194 100 125 116 137 28 118	Nothing special going on here
118	105 76 190 34 181 94 151 187 49 158 118	Kids playing hockey can be so slow.
118	96 135 9 93 142 191 37 84 151 145 118	This thing has wheels.
118	67 10 158 8 199 58 52 194 154 87 118	This is a racecar, aka deathtrap.
118	192 81 183 145 200 61 131 40 175 215 118	I wish this boring graduation would end so I can go home and watch tv
118	9 105 202 177 140 195 67 72 144 99 118	This looks like a park. A boring park.
118	99 200 154 178 155 43 59 3 140 193 118	I think the cat has a question.
118	42 182 45 128 96 27 91 190 207 159 118	Kind if pretty color.
118	60 97 123 26 140 148 161 157 53 35 118	It's a woman holding a postcard in front of a building.
118	205 120 168 89 83 182 130 62 58 54 118	This looks boring, I would rather sleep.
118	211 55 173 21 64 153 183 97 103 203 118	This is an odd and boring town.
118	209 121 20 110 56 18 52 182 136 115 118	Two men, jamming on guitars.
118	108 177 5 4 75 30 122 136 152 179 118	This guy looks like he's not having a good time.
118	211 193 84 50 19 112 151 52 96 140 118	This scene looks hot and sweaty, yuck.
118	187 153 5 195 28 184 147 149 99 53 118	The number is white.
118	199 143 71 89 215 26 196 64 97 96 118	This man is laughing in the woods. It looks like it may be a little cold out.
118	34 199 79 200 8 108 133 78 47 154 118	It would be easier to ride on a sidewalk.
118	172 204 1 14 93 74 213 44 82 100 118	Where you may see trees and fun, its all just the dead leaves being trampled with no hope for a future.
118	185 193 116 147 153 151 104 65 29 114 118	celebration birthdays and milestones
118	26 158 50 206 104 115 153 193 106 149 118	Nice bike trick
118	54 101 176 186 42 210 151 14 100 74 118	Another product manufactured in China.
118	164 19 138 32 144 197 45 198 76 174 118	That house has very little reflection in the water, but I do see tree reflections.
118	128 176 105 114 121 100 70 72 48 86 118	It's just black and white.
118	175 113 40 176 23 79 170 151 51 204 118	That looks nice I guess
118	138 13 38 24 42 1 155 115 60 71 118	Where the other half?
118	66 152 106 123 68 185 95 140 153 124 118	White snow is on the rocks.
118	89 6 107 29 212 171 214 76 61 38 118	Not sure what the fuss is all about.
118	146 167 189 71 194 199 127 100 70 119 118	Lots of green out there.
118	71 177 101 20 4 174 123 188 139 26 118	Alot of elephants looks very similar to each other. Even when they are babies.
118	112 120 150 93 213 23 145 50 33 123 118	I could smell the flowers. I could see the flowers. But they were just flowers--boring.
118	17 72 129 210 100 207 62 123 30 5 118	What a bad selfie
118	16 195 64 93 62 43 210 22 200 102 118	How boring a color
118	22 215 115 135 85 133 200 6 96 94 118	*Wants new phone* but old phone wont break. #nokia
118	203 207 124 192 212 211 135 157 42 61 118	the colors of the wall and courtyard are very boring
118	138 207 203 60 74 51 115 155 68 127 118	People driving cars on the street.
118	81 97 9 188 137 60 179 70 14 185 118	Whatever this is
118	60 81 165 205 145 50 110 176 150 94 118	What a boring alley.
118	134 53 49 114 160 20 105 129 198 141 118	She is eating ice cream.
118	95 190 148 31 117 113 204 178 172 119 118	Hooray. Onions. Wow.
118	100 143 156 75 44 27 13 38 187 82 118	That race looks boring.
118	34 125 71 108 123 131 163 143 49 74 118	I like the postures with these guys.
118	3 63 99 70 137 152 158 102 127 159 118	selfies these days are very boring as everyone one post them selves with same pose
118	75 170 160 53 101 109 24 106 173 34 118	I don't think I would have a picnic there.
118	74 186 40 98 192 152 213 58 149 23 118	A typical day in the park.
118	131 102 8 101 145 28 170 157 24 18 118	Photo one of 12,500 in the Everyday People Archive.
118	76 120 30 102 181 60 167 61 176 114 118	The background is green.
118	113 75 27 64 196 201 166 40 170 182 118	It's a phone.
118	121 33 175 177 176 194 186 208 6 115 118	This is nice.
118	202 97 68 211 43 39 71 168 84 209 118	This is a picture from our trip last week.
118	152 14 162 117 90 80 124 136 12 81 118	Another exciting night at home watching tv.
118	168 74 121 51 142 156 135 17 212 58 118	a little church
118	145 59 169 166 112 170 34 65 152 139 118	I know these veterans are waiting for someone to come home, but so is everyone; not much to see here in my opinion.
118	163 43 146 20 198 112 132 179 189 9 118	Such a boring looking camera.
118	108 80 65 16 175 130 9 51 31 112 118	Another day on the coast.
118	107 111 163 79 12 181 185 113 180 56 118	That helmet is not needed as it makes you uncool.
118	22 1 64 91 179 90 5 67 158 2 118	I like cars.
118	177 189 126 194 214 156 11 180 171 190 118	All I see is a bunch of grey and concrete.
118	175 212 61 99 3 174 159 28 20 65 118	You fold the box back up and it makes a cube.
118	87 18 43 107 102 206 69 215 186 106 118	This hand is giving the thumbs up. Good times.
118	66 4 6 158 19 153 50 51 110 128 118	There is nothing to do.
118	47 58 158 49 191 23 75 180 7 1 118	They have a picturesque artistic through way for a photo, but they just don't know how to make use of it.
118	202 36 40 92 91 7 43 170 80 8 118	WHy does the sun even come out any m ore.
118	180 189 63 128 178 172 17 213 15 167 118	Looks like an old equipment thats not usable.
118	133 160 150 137 177 169 197 158 153 112 118	I like my tea lukewarm thats my favorite. Tea all tastes the same to me.
118	211 65 63 131 100 171 44 198 59 155 118	Interesting color, I guess
118	73 62 205 126 29 6 180 16 60 182 118	Strange to wear shades in the shade. Oh, well.
118	157 149 48 86 151 5 97 214 101 114 118	It's a lake.
118	67 134 93 79 180 24 78 91 168 112 118	good snow out there
118	11 167 46 62 50 190 157 136 152 91 118	This girl is playing the drum.
118	153 176 26 88 30 115 177 80 173 116 118	An interesting place.
118	18 193 123 172 136 10 32 188 203 45 118	Ugh I abhor the beach.
118	158 165 75 91 3 56 110 144 168 146 118	Watching this show is not as entertaining as I remember it being before.
118	20 135 125 41 61 93 208 85 49 46 118	Ugh, not sure why anyone uses an umbrella in the sun.
118	37 79 2 170 164 108 103 119 126 36 118	wow so very blah
118	17 159 173 152 172 161 87 95 5 129 118	Rather odd place to paste this.
118	89 167 135 6 41 139 121 49 33 165 118	You couldn't pay me to act this way
118	54 6 160 27 185 62 55 175 29 69 118	I think he's ready to go now.
118	35 188 20 140 77 169 109 5 98 70 118	The square is not so busy
118	36 215 195 119 213 111 170 150 94 11 118	This guy looks like he's bored out of his mind.
118	46 154 97 159 47 54 33 214 132 210 118	Are this women?
118	82 138 37 185 28 196 109 142 144 30 118	Is it nap time yet?
118	205 20 186 171 10 189 44 2 166 8 118	These probably aren't even real.
118	196 127 102 96 131 81 43 95 197 199 118	Whenever I see a crownd doing the wave, I know that I am in the wrong crowd.
118	210 205 65 151 169 126 4 24 113 122 118	I like to color palette they chose and to keep it simple, no muss no fuss.
118	167 107 82 117 74 98 156 23 30 32 118	A bird sits on a tree branch.
118	174 61 13 108 158 66 25 48 62 209 118	This weather is boring.
118	62 199 19 189 106 80 97 58 5 174 118	looks like colorful butterflies
118	174 170 97 199 197 13 110 15 196 38 118	Nothing exciting goes on here.
118	78 134 102 116 41 179 169 66 154 107 118	This is my church
118	36 151 145 61 15 10 40 27 94 174 118	I would get in a boat and float for twenty minutes then head back home to the city honestly.
118	98 80 115 9 79 202 59 38 174 125 118	The paint is peeling and needs fixed.
118	109 126 44 174 181 153 160 38 192 180 118	The girl thinks she is funny.
118	43 156 50 114 128 58 171 48 123 74 118	There is snow on the bikes.
118	190 4 179 48 196 83 98 176 159 51 118	This is a picture of a wall and a window.
118	128 203 24 64 11 177 208 180 41 122 118	That is a big dog.
118	28 61 98 141 138 90 27 64 35 5 118	How boring this is.
118	197 48 79 32 208 83 108 174 82 44 118	Looks like a building
118	211 16 214 115 71 103 23 193 143 99 118	What a boring bike.
118	176 54 199 207 208 185 143 148 58 44 118	is very good
118	84 31 93 116 69 21 36 159 103 205 118	I would like to try cycling, but I don't want to step out of my comfort zone
118	63 207 48 69 114 22 134 136 201 178 118	This is a lame temple.
118	157 102 78 17 123 76 125 93 109 79 118	He is boring.
118	59 12 111 10 78 72 79 81 174 50 118	A dead tail
118	68 23 19 190 122 165 34 167 176 157 118	Class is such a boring time sometimes.
118	189 30 3 114 126 186 192 177 188 17 118	What a boring outfit.
118	40 121 72 7 104 53 36 147 110 132 118	I never really see much happen in this town.
118	130 156 134 205 143 75 70 215 80 5 118	The flower looks really bored.
118	107 84 187 131 179 215 189 154 203 127 118	Why is there a head on the floor?
118	33 117 80 82 70 6 105 159 161 84 118	My wife, and my kids.
118	173 1 193 42 56 34 131 134 46 117 118	Florals for spring. Groundbreaking.
118	132 90 111 144 18 114 177 164 135 208 118	She's wearing nike shoes...
118	161 143 83 93 15 5 68 188 189 114 118	Blue is an okay color for a shirt
118	103 53 131 34 129 46 5 214 57 33 118	Just another day hanging out with the same people.
118	116 123 154 99 55 214 66 61 170 148 118	What is she doing? I'm so bored all the time that I would be willing to do it too.
118	43 203 92 77 40 26 105 48 169 91 118	A pretty drab balding if you asked me.
118	22 177 185 105 84 208 102 188 165 196 118	Those eggs are cooking.
118	6 38 5 110 186 215 82 79 170 26 118	I'm so bored
118	65 180 184 133 19 156 24 201 80 202 118	Oh boy... another boring science experiment.
118	207 74 149 31 42 111 45 76 4 15 118	Birds are uninteresting because they have nothing to do with actuarial tables and tepid conversation.
118	147 111 215 10 190 35 18 176 102 2 118	the wall brought not a bit of attraction to anyone
118	153 48 57 164 215 180 99 94 88 187 118	Black. The most interesting color.
118	140 93 215 207 213 190 78 159 171 182 118	Once you've seen on place, you've seen them all.
118	104 5 74 20 188 148 187 55 18 212 118	I see this tree as boring.
118	19 56 88 165 99 83 114 91 95 185 118	Such an old structure, would it be of any significance?
118	15 188 135 73 163 161 177 16 98 106 118	What a boring photo of tall grass and a tower.
118	96 153 58 179 167 95 24 113 109 25 118	if saw this pictures it will make happy mood
118	139 26 183 21 9 171 103 161 46 58 118	I think that's called "mauve"... dunno though.
118	178 154 58 202 126 208 143 135 67 124 118	Grey logs and brown dirt make lovely scenery
118	96 114 138 210 172 117 162 182 213 133 118	what a boring signage
118	82 26 35 79 67 174 142 90 71 179 118	Not want i would love to read,boring!
118	165 100 25 50 11 146 119 9 180 136 118	i bet this guy could put you to sleep
118	210 91 150 80 202 47 51 133 112 136 118	This is a boring picture as far as I can tell.
118	175 27 157 45 2 100 136 91 15 60 118	Yep, another plain old building.
118	48 154 134 178 85 99 93 214 63 110 118	I could look at this sign for hours.
118	24 164 184 130 119 15 2 7 23 132 118	I like the beach sometimes.
118	167 13 25 176 202 71 70 182 75 24 118	There's an owl, and some cactus, and some dirt. Hmm.
118	95 43 46 215 129 82 190 31 151 76 118	I am looking up there.
118	159 28 199 34 198 53 94 131 191 24 118	This man is reading.
118	75 207 173 51 194 130 163 96 138 176 118	there is nothing special about a hand
118	60 205 18 132 138 20 139 159 88 107 118	fun, sunny, gloomy
118	51 35 193 71 130 20 181 213 115 47 118	Look, a baseball game.
118	40 176 89 188 174 32 28 92 192 129 118	I don't see you improving much.
118	133 188 46 4 96 184 151 177 15 147 118	What a boring, empty street.
118	192 117 36 154 32 23 153 104 212 129 118	meh, eating a mint.
118	66 146 163 195 48 172 125 103 45 174 118	It is not so bright but shows the true nature of art
118	13 21 31 206 24 62 72 100 79 103 118	The tent is red
118	117 59 21 88 44 135 202 61 197 139 118	They are just standing around in white pjs
118	79 116 99 40 175 144 111 42 185 160 118	Cool picture, dude.
118	163 119 179 21 62 70 73 212 100 46 118	I like the color green.
118	82 77 15 128 49 112 211 209 114 175 118	This would be sad during the winter.
118	203 193 172 174 201 185 168 4 133 189 118	This cemetery looks morbid.
118	10 20 177 209 90 154 89 80 43 164 118	It's just a bird feeder.
118	45 147 215 50 149 97 109 179 177 48 118	Just another purple square.
118	195 129 139 132 3 18 135 136 34 25 118	the little boy is ready to play but his friend did not come.
118	188 39 85 147 128 66 207 61 179 190 118	OK I can tell that she's involved in the guitar craft
118	130 40 123 132 156 17 137 102 95 188 118	Calling panther power
118	140 196 38 9 113 215 99 90 159 91 118	Too colorful for me
118	109 89 142 116 80 4 197 60 186 120 118	Study hall is so boring.
118	29 87 149 34 47 82 73 94 54 182 118	I guess that looks like a pretty decent meal.
118	166 30 203 47 32 199 106 177 68 153 118	Lime green is too stimulating I need something much more beige.
118	33 200 4 109 47 168 1 62 147 128 118	This post is brought to you by the letter A.
118	142 16 119 4 117 32 25 196 98 149 118	It's just grey...like life.
118	108 126 6 122 142 183 60 137 149 106 118	Not much going on here.
118	89 196 31 109 177 84 127 16 149 162 118	I don't get why I'm looking at a squash or lemon.
118	128 169 87 111 97 190 137 3 85 20 118	There are some green hills and a body of water.
119	34 99 212 5 71 213 69 45 152 68 119	I hope the photographer in this photo did not fall while taking this picture.
119	13 51 149 114 111 32 78 56 98 183 119	these trees look neurotic
119	151 19 191 34 7 196 203 31 184 186 119	The man is obsessive about playing in public
119	141 148 138 139 117 81 80 200 133 106 119	They need to clean the scuffs off the floor!
119	51 158 78 199 147 3 192 83 63 52 119	i wish i could climb to the top.
119	137 62 98 134 184 104 174 46 146 39 119	The darkness is making me obsessive with light
119	164 9 12 115 17 41 141 197 20 146 119	You have to be obsessive to keep the dock clean
119	70 87 174 169 96 6 81 54 126 26 119	That is a lot of people. I cant imagine the logistics of this event. I need to clean just thinking about it.
119	10 103 100 203 51 45 188 80 142 171 119	You'd have to be very careful driving down a narrow street like this.
119	26 103 175 41 197 178 48 132 135 71 119	Oh man I just don't know what I am going to do if the guy in blue loses!  I'll lose my mind!
119	100 187 23 150 124 34 189 139 43 15 119	This plane has so many details, but I wonder how they all work together... are they safe? How do they make sure they didn't forget anything?
119	44 33 89 81 139 37 102 106 197 192 119	It is important that I go to every single building in this picture.
119	90 156 111 104 102 182 31 169 191 29 119	I must have that sword!  Someone tell that guy I'll pay him any price for that sword!
119	60 191 5 72 133 7 91 48 213 100 119	I love old wooden toys!!!
119	18 163 91 174 201 142 7 31 154 83 119	I would train many hours to get this right and be better than anyone else.
119	209 6 49 80 15 20 14 175 163 121 119	Why is that child alone, where are the parents?
119	177 145 79 110 24 172 147 159 23 53 119	Peace, Love and Fishnets!
119	185 203 63 94 151 137 70 113 155 187 119	The designer is obsessive about fans
119	6 150 47 21 78 126 115 99 211 92 119	The boy is obsessive with comparing
119	183 128 19 57 71 209 73 147 141 95 119	Could be an unstable day to fly
119	175 103 57 97 102 94 210 5 80 137 119	This reminds me of a scene out of an horror movie. I like it.
119	208 61 9 122 157 202 106 20 101 128 119	I just know I am going to side swipe that gas tanker!!!
119	41 21 46 102 33 59 66 141 208 80 119	If I don't get on land soon I fear i'll drown.
119	151 189 213 7 25 149 174 84 182 210 119	That boy needs a shirt! He'll get sunburnt!
119	2 96 166 93 157 48 35 73 165 63 119	The listening device is on.
119	149 59 167 85 115 8 163 10 64 151 119	That room looks very unclean.
119	199 122 209 210 53 10 144 129 68 75 119	All I can think about is all the cat hair!
119	21 11 112 86 187 56 94 154 164 78 119	He can't be sleeping, he shouldn't be alone, oh no.
119	112 203 71 136 33 150 131 115 204 55 119	He should have his mouth closed for a picture.
119	211 198 118 205 17 45 105 123 152 142 119	I really hope that kid doesn't get hurt from that anvil, he looks like he may want to touch it, I hope he doesn't!
119	5 207 112 130 52 31 54 132 164 128 119	I would never attempt this even if someone paid me to do so.
119	25 106 32 134 12 146 49 27 152 127 119	I love parades! The are so great. Parades,parades,parades,parades.
119	84 1 41 131 76 42 202 95 54 15 119	I can't sleep until I know that this cat is alive and safe.  Please tell me someone rescued it.
119	122 24 32 205 36 131 151 14 143 129 119	Those lights are entirely too bright, I'm sure they're blinding everyone.
119	60 146 210 196 200 20 54 1 8 118 119	I am so crazy about mascots!
119	150 115 113 170 116 75 20 212 108 8 119	hos hat does not match his outfit and it hurts to look at
119	124 62 171 152 148 151 82 48 36 38 119	This whole display makes me anxious.
119	145 65 204 19 45 134 185 154 195 182 119	This is dull, I don't like dull colored food.
119	28 149 169 91 121 155 9 83 95 112 119	This needs to be cleaned badly.
119	87 109 22 6 71 100 191 3 115 77 119	Hopefully he makes a home run!
119	40 20 97 160 125 116 206 26 61 75 119	This sand needs to be smoothed over... The bumps and curves make me stressed.
119	114 139 72 34 199 25 147 103 9 64 119	Is that guys red tie straight?
119	87 169 129 12 200 93 202 124 154 159 119	I would do anything in the entire world to be able to live in this city.
119	212 197 181 117 52 208 160 185 12 60 119	The sky cant even be seen
119	195 171 193 210 117 49 85 170 22 131 119	I want to be there right now at this second.
119	45 74 208 108 160 88 125 70 191 24 119	What are the white things all over the photograph? They get in the way of the subject matter so much! Plus the whole photo feels unbalanced to me.
119	135 196 84 22 66 2 176 73 41 16 119	I don't think I would be able to sit still during this presentation, it would drive me crazy.
119	189 158 155 174 170 33 4 105 50 178 119	Alot of green in that picture, did I mention green?
119	193 41 202 130 179 191 71 188 176 77 119	I wonder who goes there,what happens at that rock and who stays
119	140 160 69 67 214 130 127 116 25 57 119	Those clouds look like a form a geoengineering.
119	58 180 91 137 38 6 215 176 75 172 119	The could fall and crush my head
119	135 16 32 80 208 73 195 49 65 15 119	I need to find out where she lives and her phone number.  PLEASE CALL ME!
119	91 141 14 142 154 94 117 129 162 185 119	That red key stands out and is so ugly - it should be white like the rest
119	30 163 71 161 24 73 152 74 96 205 119	Poorly aligned image. Large open space to the left draws attention.
119	159 131 56 60 117 186 202 80 5 29 119	Dont let him eat the chips he could choke!
119	19 33 20 76 112 170 177 6 9 212 119	Wait I have to count all the birds
119	5 69 65 1 35 134 16 62 205 215 119	The train probably isn't on time, I hate when my train isn't on time, I try to get to the stop at least 30 minutes ahead of time so I'm never late for my train and then they go and do things like this.
119	192 127 10 86 80 150 153 121 59 139 119	I don't know if I would be able to get over my anxiety to do this.
119	59 43 113 159 192 133 76 49 139 89 119	I LOVE the skater in the blue helmet. She's my FAVOURITE. I've seen her every event. SHE'S THE BEST!!
119	181 39 95 109 118 93 63 114 103 24 119	Those are some really really nice clouds and a nice hirizon I like them.
119	77 4 180 149 167 47 186 172 66 113 119	Those statues look like they're going to come to life and attack me!
119	127 82 31 209 199 25 148 17 192 81 119	Those clouds need to be photoshopped to be symetrical, and we need to mirror the rocks on the other side
119	51 109 208 195 104 68 172 15 144 154 119	I can't have anyone else on this boat but me!
119	39 144 169 55 139 133 145 204 151 174 119	why would they not light the whole porch before taking this picture!
119	21 115 181 121 96 53 13 138 182 85 119	did you use the flour that i forced you to look into
119	149 157 124 41 136 147 20 108 140 153 119	I just cannot stand that they put signs up all over the place in the outdoors!
119	176 52 203 79 125 23 139 69 142 63 119	Someone please help her tie the bandana for its correctional purpose.
119	146 182 152 6 84 112 41 60 212 7 119	The way that the grass is patchy in this picture irritates my OCD I can't stand to look at it
119	47 9 147 138 59 192 133 194 73 11 119	Those are eyes behind them watching us!
119	206 21 82 186 196 118 86 4 189 13 119	unstable golf course
119	194 31 139 7 164 49 196 114 52 35 119	I have knitted a 2d replica of all the Pokemon.
119	77 67 167 174 23 179 109 97 64 31 119	I need one of those cars, so much, right now.
119	159 162 214 55 166 87 46 131 118 191 119	He could easily be followed, someone should make him run someplace safer.
119	18 101 120 206 73 102 201 154 7 144 119	The alignment of these letters makes me want to rewrite the sign everytime I see it.
119	129 24 154 121 100 101 65 141 192 14 119	Don't go in there! you may never come out.
119	207 130 61 182 94 38 115 14 29 178 119	Guys, just take a look at this picture. You see that grain? That awful texture all over it? It's like sand. It really gives me the jeebees. Shouldn't technology nowadays allow for cheaper access to a good camera? Lordy, look at that...
119	14 22 12 108 47 136 196 97 202 93 119	Just seeing this gives me anxiety! The rockslides are such a major concern.
119	65 201 32 114 12 143 108 192 174 100 119	There is too much stuff going on on the walls. It's going to give me a panic attack.
119	170 146 1 102 6 27 114 195 112 117 119	The car really needs to move over more, it's RIGHT ONE the yellow line and completely off center!
119	105 192 31 210 213 145 152 135 140 81 119	I wonder what those swirls are above that mountain? You think they're chem trails and they're trying to poison us again?
119	202 136 170 147 63 142 38 143 196 68 119	Why is it called penny arcade when they are all made of chocolate?
119	146 189 153 57 83 39 36 201 196 137 119	I wonder who that statue is of. What sport did he play? What was his number?
119	74 104 12 41 135 167 56 70 118 85 119	why is there no water in this dam? what is pollution so bad that we cannot event get water in a manmade dam?
119	28 208 93 173 86 159 78 4 151 202 119	You cannot wear that necklace with that dress! dont!
119	204 86 66 99 138 198 62 172 75 149 119	Let's us hug for the next week straight.
119	35 170 76 56 68 184 138 51 181 112 119	That tie should really be tied a bit tighter, the knot is pretty low on the neck for it to be considered dressing up
119	58 128 39 166 43 164 96 31 184 77 119	Why isn't everyone wearing blue? It would be better if everyone was wearing blue.
119	151 125 19 166 156 209 161 4 30 199 119	This is most definitely a deadly flower!
119	99 35 95 59 11 210 38 180 204 136 119	why would they put so much on the grate at one time, that is not safe
119	51 23 112 187 11 120 118 17 135 139 119	Good night, what are you drinking? what club are yo in? did you get there early?
119	19 17 135 114 144 159 155 48 9 170 119	Can't hopscotch on those blocks.
119	196 34 197 185 32 21 60 77 157 49 119	I would love to just count every rock that outlines the base of that tree and then order them in a precise way so that none of them overlap. That would be perfection.
119	60 62 172 46 128 204 81 130 52 105 119	This is a major accomplishment for him! Great job for all your hard work!
119	135 78 18 150 118 41 136 120 146 88 119	I would love to steal this building, I love the design so much, I need to have it!
119	68 55 58 82 166 77 128 57 17 41 119	Paul Bunyan, meets the basketball diaries
119	140 165 61 44 16 22 132 213 96 196 119	This engine is going to explode!
119	181 206 57 83 157 10 35 177 29 132 119	Being in/around cemeteries always makes me feel so weird, like the ghosts are still watching me
119	87 15 177 21 187 91 111 150 24 109 119	this is green, OMG i cant believe its so colorful
119	109 66 139 62 184 201 150 148 124 56 119	Why is there cardboard on the window?
119	196 148 72 141 76 174 162 209 200 146 119	GET ME OUT OF HERE NOW!
119	48 73 198 49 126 141 108 171 129 83 119	An unstable life is horrible for women, sometimes the root cause is lack of money!
119	58 135 95 90 157 54 42 50 97 176 119	I love the angle
119	198 134 9 74 83 202 5 78 209 37 119	theres a lot going on... interesting
119	83 129 196 154 76 65 19 146 43 174 119	some are obsesessbie about biking
119	15 100 68 193 110 120 6 61 159 127 119	it looks like one side is looser than the other. The braid should have continued all the way down.
119	195 72 110 128 43 177 10 143 90 206 119	I wonder if that rain is cold
119	142 180 51 31 97 169 188 75 21 76 119	When I look at this image, I feel like my eyes are blurry in my head.
119	186 128 199 22 18 38 2 54 19 141 119	This picture is too blurry it's giving me a headache. They should have held the camera more still. It's nauseating.
119	66 153 42 166 60 135 7 102 106 87 119	I really hope they drink all of that, I mean, it's sitting there just going to waste while they take selfies!
119	32 141 137 175 21 24 41 208 120 50 119	I have a much cooler dragon figure in my collection

119	84 134 16 87 7 102 214 32 105 147 119	This guy really needs to make sure that his microphone isn't so close to his face, it could cause feedback, and give other people germs, and just make him look stupid!
119	38 69 102 183 65 121 27 64 78 92 119	Holding this dancer looks inviting.

120	163 116 106 215 213 203 46 208 5 132 120	This is exactly what Jesus had in mind.
120	37 46 26 138 72 176 169 40 57 132 120	That looks like the pefect place for the hyenas from The Lion King to take over as their next dwelling.
120	41 121 13 81 186 3 136 85 66 55 120	The people are dressed up funny

121	179 163 202 193 38 100 37 60 132 29 121	It is smart to make earphones with ironman on it
121	106 87 11 86 79 191 68 8 6 124 121	It is smart to put up a wall
121	156 206 64 10 185 179 114 143 58 139 121	Banter between friends
121	79 12 34 58 10 134 108 114 80 202 121	That purple tie is very styleish and gives the speaker a positive impression.
121	8 160 63 178 42 38 76 53 9 123 121	What do you Meme?!
121	37 154 49 120 78 187 171 9 84 100 121	Draw a line through all four planes and you can get a lower case r.
121	44 149 88 50 90 117 46 181 60 168 121	I wonder if I am the only one that knows how to get in and out of this cave system.
121	125 192 172 21 148 19 42 2 158 13 121	She made sure to have those sunglasses for when the sun got in her eyes.
121	57 73 117 20 136 198 184 103 32 135 121	gorgeous colors, nice day!
121	122 7 139 164 169 99 168 119 202 133 121	I hope that photographer was further than he looks.
121	44 70 42 64 87 38 91 104 117 157 121	Who is this pool really built for?
121	162 180 153 144 17 68 139 95 159 81 121	This statue would be most welcome in the finest of museums.
121	31 199 10 46 186 32 141 204 119 50 121	I would move the cabinet before I fix the floor.
121	142 159 113 59 152 182 211 5 66 115 121	Would you look at this bowl, it has such a genius design by having a small leg on the bottom to help support it from falling.
121	82 85 40 205 172 191 210 21 161 197 121	The baby is so smart
121	77 201 149 6 124 209 113 42 91 139 121	Watching the beauty of the sunset clears the mind.
121	120 144 142 35 146 211 77 199 186 213 121	Ingenious looking geeks
121	1 5 191 98 74 100 57 213 132 173 121	Tilting the camera does not mean that the flags will droop.
121	71 166 139 7 184 155 73 149 102 6 121	I love watching all the creatures visit the stream!
121	44 9 102 43 35 112 170 214 198 202 121	hmm, I wonder if that person at the red doors plans to dive into the water.
121	111 40 66 154 150 135 45 52 68 215 121	I bet I can guess where they're going.
121	100 145 196 139 186 212 140 92 153 36 121	I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking at, but I'm certain I can figure it out eventually.
121	17 89 180 204 21 150 98 77 5 126 121	Such a playful boy.
121	141 92 202 213 204 105 88 178 193 186 121	I'm pretty sure 1 nice sized microphone would have been sufficient.
121	86 201 4 144 212 196 108 29 96 49 121	It's pretty cool how that hung that old plane there for everyone to admire through the ages.
121	41 161 74 8 181 205 188 54 135 95 121	She must be looking for crystals.
121	32 25 27 100 193 53 199 140 59 111 121	X marks the spot of an ugly foot!
121	17 148 37 31 57 101 201 43 142 109 121	The girl is so smart
121	133 190 206 114 20 81 64 112 59 90 121	Did you see what he did that was an awesome play!
121	140 19 187 95 138 87 153 43 40 53 121	His ballet stance is incredible.
121	77 11 65 153 209 201 186 130 134 55 121	I am sure this lookout tower is 100 feet tall.
121	130 183 157 1 158 26 128 21 16 65 121	This chick is about to steal the base!
121	69 107 87 139 26 201 97 152 211 74 121	He's trying one of everything, good idea bud!
121	33 132 174 203 205 63 15 171 144 173 121	This man could benefit from a dedicated training plan.
121	25 105 135 60 158 62 110 120 119 128 121	Green is the color of money.
121	10 158 71 49 104 73 139 186 47 46 121	A spider making a web near his prey's food source. Clever Girl!
121	17 154 166 75 45 66 124 152 63 209 121	I can't even tell it's cake!
121	6 196 40 95 180 189 127 31 64 46 121	his shirt should say "I;m single and always will be" LOL
121	50 157 195 208 99 150 154 214 192 48 121	As the bird strikes its mate to get frisky
121	26 183 184 94 67 113 212 65 187 25 121	Quite beautiful, I wonder how many hours it took to complete such work
121	126 131 104 97 195 53 35 56 61 175 121	A car could fit in that alley
121	166 30 15 62 8 85 108 116 99 66 121	I think this bird might have strayed from his pack.
121	106 203 82 37 85 209 103 101 73 38 121	I think I've seen every inch of this town, there's just nothing to see.
121	51 186 41 213 39 18 91 203 106 181 121	This is where the hobbits are at.
121	33 124 105 3 61 109 103 207 193 192 121	Is that a tattoo of himself on himself?
121	180 164 65 144 89 44 176 56 15 157 121	Do you think that Visa wants to advertise here or what?
121	94 58 89 18 144 162 205 157 61 106 121	Feeling a little GREEN today?
121	75 136 138 10 126 98 35 32 204 3 121	See how he gloats
121	201 55 126 189 214 177 155 60 180 195 121	That statue appears to be hiding his facing and counting to 100 while we find our hiding places.
121	186 123 52 83 155 34 91 188 100 145 121	Skis. Human tires
121	164 193 165 190 15 133 150 54 215 36 121	Just row with it.
121	49 145 55 102 5 195 208 205 137 170 121	They really pulled off the fall theme in this pic.
121	131 39 189 137 21 163 179 94 111 90 121	Judging by their body langauge, they're not a couple.
121	10 38 138 100 69 23 58 209 78 181 121	how clever it is to tackle a problem in a unique way.
121	199 176 128 65 56 210 148 104 213 17 121	The engineer of this gate was a mastermind.
121	166 2 125 158 42 213 123 114 135 113 121	The way the sun shines on this scene makes me want to get someone to find it so I can go there.
121	119 169 102 113 20 94 47 196 204 86 121	(On the other side of that sea, there's a blue chair.)
121	106 179 125 195 95 207 119 192 197 188 121	I think that a lot of amusement parks could learn a thing or two from this venue.
121	78 66 195 186 40 31 75 3 63 87 121	I had no idea that Humpty Dumpty was a rapper.
121	199 143 173 175 127 145 188 77 108 148 121	They're probably thinking, "let me just rest here, no one will  notice."
121	124 48 32 145 46 51 66 149 107 117 121	Where is he going to park his horse?
121	141 132 62 194 79 30 59 192 69 63 121	These veggies are so much better than sweets.  Let's give tthem a try.
121	59 41 152 180 11 199 9 213 30 38 121	The lights give the building a special touch.
121	5 204 96 141 9 210 178 179 45 181 121	This reminds me of Michael Scott from the office
121	168 184 156 150 146 170 106 145 81 70 121	His socks don't match his shoes.
121	204 77 130 107 104 132 164 206 94 148 121	The tower is tall.
121	143 88 171 63 213 31 45 37 169 38 121	If the game is find a man in a green hat, I've won.
121	93 88 201 196 6 120 23 86 54 10 121	This is a classic Brazilian dance - that looks like Rio.
121	174 156 35 139 43 152 60 181 59 5 121	Use this as firewood to keep me warm.
121	35 51 8 60 95 54 131 164 30 78 121	This is a very old monument to ancient times.
121	147 158 117 72 83 205 174 129 130 146 121	To fly is to always be free.
121	7 158 132 146 51 143 12 153 92 193 121	All these cops means I can rob the bank.
121	182 186 46 36 199 177 52 183 148 106 121	It's like a salad burrito.
121	211 132 149 33 200 81 208 57 83 50 121	Must not be too important because there are a lot of empty seats.
121	6 79 10 178 66 73 47 173 152 114 121	mokopa can be used to make a very refreshing pickle
121	213 103 82 166 112 44 170 21 11 149 121	A house on the water us worth two in the bushes.
121	106 180 56 29 91 96 131 85 211 60 121	I bet that tree would be a nice bridge across cold water.
121	90 181 9 13 117 17 132 122 98 104 121	All of these singers graduate from the my alma mater and have exceptional voices.
121	7 201 93 33 80 45 43 158 204 89 121	Welcome to my hidden garden. If you know what I mean...
121	63 11 150 78 138 162 124 183 62 159 121	This machine isn't great, it's just sew-sew
121	130 163 180 209 107 210 13 14 72 164 121	The sky looks like it is eating the trees.
121	77 127 52 161 114 207 205 186 213 182 121	He must be part of the blue man group.
121	90 183 118 151 6 51 206 146 144 172 121	Architecture is similar to the library on my campus! Beautiful
121	166 180 21 95 15 96 139 195 143 86 121	I bet they can't see me over here in the dark.
121	87 64 113 196 214 135 174 61 51 124 121	That building has a lot of years, it would be wise to leave it as is.
121	198 159 142 3 101 72 157 54 123 31 121	Those kids seem really smart.
121	122 8 28 137 17 134 113 13 151 19 121	Where did the ball go?
121	7 113 204 22 198 177 191 180 209 86 121	Nothing like seeing your base of power!
121	68 175 103 191 15 128 152 196 159 146 121	Well done taking that picture at 372 km/hour.
121	52 128 184 32 209 94 188 104 85 96 121	Looks like he's contemplating the precise angle he needs to roll to make that 7-10 split.
121	180 57 159 22 189 29 178 62 38 43 121	Last one to look at the camera picks up the check
121	199 5 104 85 32 120 67 46 181 61 121	That boy can climb better than a monkey.
121	91 206 12 58 94 144 175 164 73 75 121	this giraffe looks like it has spotted its dinner
121	37 29 115 91 205 207 93 15 94 203 121	CGI is getting more and more realistic!
121	110 5 71 53 68 84 46 174 24 186 121	i believe the on who wear spectacles are genius
121	36 144 73 131 115 153 44 180 165 68 121	This train looks like it needs replacing. I don't think its good idea of using such an old engines.
121	69 190 39 106 183 191 152 212 53 27 121	Both runners will be looking to use any advantage to gain ground.
121	215 91 154 8 59 20 179 206 79 6 121	This woman practiced for a long time for this moment.
121	162 47 172 61 88 197 10 2 70 39 121	wow, that looks like fun
121	64 91 113 72 193 31 87 15 199 102 121	we are either maing enterances for folks of all body shapes or we have found another use for duct tape.
121	68 119 148 31 156 63 124 97 78 12 121	i love surfing it is clever to have this fun
121	115 160 45 68 194 197 162 190 137 124 121	This photo reminds me of an M.C Escher painting.
121	55 95 161 75 51 30 168 188 96 142 121	He must have a lot of money.
121	56 171 203 9 68 12 6 34 162 194 121	the reflective nature of the building created an amazing view
121	107 205 163 200 110 209 207 152 12 61 121	The guy photobombing could have done a better job at a different angle.
121	66 195 158 174 83 70 41 105 4 75 121	Someone forgot the song is "99 red balloons" not multicolour package :P
121	202 49 64 18 76 28 31 119 124 77 121	This baby is cuter than a cat on caturday!
121	36 139 116 95 20 108 60 13 92 144 121	They don't look like they are going anywhere special.
121	16 1 15 165 4 195 47 146 147 78 121	If the room suddenly foods, he'll be prepared for it.
121	90 110 20 165 197 173 91 191 42 176 121	With this one hard push, your shoulder pain will be eliminated.
121	60 169 184 80 194 165 21 130 172 185 121	That's one way to be fit
121	30 182 39 101 52 109 120 198 53 132 121	The man in the middle is smart.  Alone is the way to go.
121	92 72 192 153 158 198 96 201 45 14 121	The doors on this place are genius.
121	21 125 200 184 100 7 131 23 19 201 121	Lets flee this place and have fun
121	207 67 105 4 18 110 57 146 171 90 121	This is why man created belts.
121	96 28 119 3 116 145 89 202 186 26 121	At that angle and trajectory, he should be able to hit the ball at correct velocity.
121	81 50 141 55 182 128 106 192 126 65 121	This is a very helpful establishment for the needy.
121	7 74 197 5 202 128 47 56 113 122 121	Now that is a genius way of displaying information for the group.
121	18 198 13 68 4 139 70 54 159 25 121	Bigger wheels are to have a better traction in the mud
121	198 120 179 118 151 183 102 182 9 96 121	Although its really barren out there it's so pretty
121	52 169 80 40 131 97 47 134 204 122 121	The size of pool fits his height perfectly!
121	74 38 43 113 128 6 64 34 40 107 121	The green color is interesting.
121	122 64 25 200 197 27 68 101 174 215 121	I sure wouldn't want to get stuck out in that field.  There's nothing for miles.
121	8 27 80 3 17 53 208 39 81 14 121	The building has a overhang where i guess you can hang out.
121	63 13 192 35 184 71 50 173 21 214 121	Just bring a vacuum clean and voila, fog gone
121	159 18 189 87 42 110 151 170 188 17 121	I wonder what image they'll put on that green screen
121	136 31 162 98 186 122 164 148 1 198 121	And then there was light!
121	54 29 78 134 70 189 23 50 89 75 121	This season of Power Rangers has been really serious.
121	118 139 16 29 20 101 43 152 88 48 121	If I make 2 plates now, I won't have to come back.
121	171 140 90 45 117 199 76 124 80 120 121	She almost had me fooled with her ingenious disguise.
121	135 1 192 177 8 61 128 215 79 198 121	Blocking the shot until the last minute is such an amazing thing to train for!
121	128 194 89 201 67 146 28 50 126 88 121	I wonder if they are waiting for someone to perform in the empty space.
121	16 12 200 157 84 181 104 65 41 123 121	I think this snake is trying to spell out a message.
121	97 67 195 38 34 126 142 205 44 82 121	These poles keep me if the sidewalk
121	205 17 139 148 145 72 124 114 144 177 121	My boat wouldn't fit in this tiny port
121	75 145 153 210 60 104 144 147 157 214 121	I'll fix this quick
121	5 16 194 42 56 57 143 62 115 31 121	What a large vessel. They look like they move so slow from this far away. I bet some people are amazed at how it can float, not knowing that it weighs less than the mass of water it's constantly displacing

121	168 122 70 176 193 177 33 65 175 63 121	Is that a tape deck, or are you just happy to see me?
121	96 165 199 186 175 58 39 180 67 38 121	This game needs fewer players and wider goals.

122	172 73 162 67 156 76 72 24 89 171 122	They should help each other win, I would.
122	145 155 60 198 200 78 126 162 61 106 122	Caleb has worked so hard. Hope he had fun!
122	148 16 141 37 181 150 44 38 169 97 122	I am proud of your photography skills. You are a skilled person!

122	45 8 186 44 85 131 36 38 68 185 122	We need to save the fish!
122	10 34 4 133 126 194 48 120 152 68 122	How many people bled and sweat to make this roof?
122	121 22 51 186 21 161 210 167 142 112 122	I'm at the bar, listening to this band and buying my friend drinks because she broke up with her boyfriend.
122	89 9 211 97 61 154 56 59 29 104 122	I can tell he knows how to enjoy life.
122	57 198 38 75 83 18 88 107 157 51 122	I feel bad for this little girl. If she were just a little taller she could see out of this window.
122	145 32 168 166 62 140 134 11 36 58 122	It can't be fun living in such a dreary place.
122	59 6 109 153 134 66 74 131 142 178 122	I feel so bad for those flowers! That style of typewriter was made with heavy amounts of lead. Everytime it rains, those chemicals are seeping into the plants and ground around it. Poor wee flowers.
122	39 187 207 63 121 151 71 130 133 210 122	The water brings a peaceful calm mood.
122	69 9 2 11 21 143 187 102 20 152 122	Dirt rally racing is fun
122	211 88 29 111 161 160 179 158 39 187 122	I can be difficult to raise children these days with the possibility of them falling off swings.
122	111 147 203 20 33 213 40 164 3 17 122	That's not a very flattering angle, I feel bad for them!
122	50 36 164 155 54 198 147 89 67 64 122	These children have been working so hard to put on this play.  It's a shame they are being setback by audio issues.
122	172 42 152 88 123 161 205 2 78 121 122	A lady who's weathered the storm.
122	70 215 2 148 74 51 168 207 124 144 122	Precious kitty is just begging for attention.
122	42 210 44 133 32 107 163 150 87 171 122	She is a great tennis player.
122	84 154 150 121 8 87 148 110 12 197 122	I hope these poor women don't have to wear those heels all day, I'm sure they're in pain!
122	132 17 43 84 108 4 38 70 200 169 122	All the villagers have sadly been chased from this beautiful site!
122	163 31 167 145 82 203 66 153 148 103 122	I hope the bird isn't freezing, that water looks cold!
122	4 132 176 32 2 166 112 98 119 126 122	That building is probably all those people can afford.
122	164 41 214 79 98 150 27 123 143 78 122	What a quiet place, hopefully they make enough to stay open.
122	124 116 21 185 22 182 175 34 105 45 122	Hope that horse has water and food.
122	143 54 171 15 177 42 11 212 23 77 122	I'm so lucky not to have to make this trip in a car, I'm really feeling for all those bussers right now.
122	34 181 173 68 39 187 57 137 119 155 122	These palm trees are hurting in the sun.
122	175 132 153 129 123 168 130 15 71 90 122	Hopefully he can afford contacts.
122	162 202 163 161 112 90 212 126 105 189 122	i feel sorry for the women who is with the man who owns this vehicle for his ego is so big, she must have a hard time
122	107 34 86 73 26 3 161 69 56 191 122	I think they missed the essence of the photo.
122	204 155 40 174 106 41 3 2 134 166 122	I feel a pang of sadness for the people who had to build this.
122	169 31 86 149 17 176 60 27 52 80 122	I'd hate to be the rock under a waterfall.
122	6 18 119 82 130 173 72 110 8 103 122	I really feel bad for people having to wait for hours at this station.
122	57 207 161 37 140 104 48 119 200 51 122	As I eat my hamburger, I feel bad for the folks dieting here.
122	98 180 138 31 193 104 52 198 116 208 122	I hope whoever worked hard to dig up those gemstones were properly compensated
122	179 141 81 56 173 162 180 203 48 191 122	The cat looks friendly
122	53 142 71 82 193 190 35 198 172 90 122	The people are trying to get motivated to workout
122	40 96 180 214 35 30 175 209 53 179 122	The man looks like he has had a long day
122	148 74 189 2 105 213 55 119 126 17 122	I feel bad that these kids do not have a playground to play on.
122	41 183 182 42 135 154 200 204 86 51 122	I remember my early days as a child playing Teris.
122	46 158 113 169 131 80 60 116 156 45 122	I wish her the best of luck in her future.
122	207 28 60 99 56 87 134 55 199 14 122	It's hard having to use public transport
122	213 182 120 116 7 140 32 69 215 179 122	It must be so hard for her to speak in public.
122	181 65 125 172 46 69 91 170 3 179 122	The river flows beautifully like the souls of cildren.
122	193 197 134 68 39 30 167 97 59 67 122	I feel bad for the girl not having a good time
122	180 3 137 211 170 47 75 49 133 182 122	I pity the painter
122	119 196 87 22 174 20 203 103 132 193 122	This is a really nice photo of you two.
122	174 47 202 173 66 8 189 91 70 187 122	I hope they have a safe flight.
122	69 188 2 74 18 53 52 67 143 76 122	These dogs do not have a home.
122	83 112 148 34 63 30 172 199 91 130 122	I would pick up after them
122	203 71 65 18 195 60 77 211 191 194 122	The darkness must represent a sad or tragic event that occured
122	10 197 184 145 4 23 129 58 28 101 122	This subway station bench seems lonely.
122	192 144 182 17 181 93 110 71 171 38 122	This poor man looks so tired. He should probably get some rest if he can stop working
122	148 215 67 79 205 2 170 213 42 24 122	How unfortunate for the people of this town that they seem to not have much in the way of a beach.
122	143 60 189 14 47 212 140 55 169 57 122	I hope he is not dying
122	28 55 80 211 91 98 174 190 189 94 122	This is great painting. I believe the painter should be paid for such a good piece of art.
122	204 75 38 101 119 209 37 164 102 128 122	If a person were scared of the dark, this scene might be frightening. I feel badly for them.
122	179 105 10 106 42 142 52 20 153 169 122	what a great family outing. It is great that they can still get together for fun times.
122	14 63 41 17 159 195 138 37 169 143 122	Awwwwww The poor baby wants to get out of his stroller.
122	29 25 44 59 192 121 195 23 60 174 122	It's a shame some people don't have real homes and have to live in tents. My heart goes out to them
122	152 105 211 30 209 16 3 61 2 18 122	I pity any tiny fish that has to survive in the dark depths of the sea
122	193 44 110 85 120 189 185 45 20 211 122	This looks like a very sad situation.
122	103 186 51 211 144 65 145 55 167 100 122	My sister and I used to laugh just like this many years ago.
122	205 117 182 77 103 46 195 38 91 180 122	looks like an angel!
122	97 201 156 211 155 136 66 51 108 117 122	i dislike animals
122	69 104 70 209 42 78 36 15 170 187 122	I wonder what her dreams are
122	138 144 168 105 194 147 22 17 173 135 122	I get so emotional over the state of these old buildings.
122	52 39 162 62 119 205 164 54 78 3 122	I can only imagine the amount of pressure this man is under.
122	206 181 47 9 151 28 35 155 61 163 122	Oh, how awful!
122	121 43 154 180 55 204 93 158 97 171 122	I wish I could help fix those blinds in the back!
122	101 163 148 51 47 200 17 116 5 203 122	Finding friends was easy for some of the tour group but difficult for others.
122	71 146 3 50 33 158 20 152 213 151 122	I feel bad that the lady is all by herself.
122	40 184 157 85 114 33 15 116 69 46 122	I hope this baby gets some sleep soon, she looks tired.
122	1 29 63 3 192 210 176 39 88 147 122	i hope they are having a good golf game
122	146 73 39 15 46 125 88 86 213 14 122	Group pictures are a great many way to memorialize times well spent.
122	139 30 212 21 85 95 79 41 107 124 122	I feel for the person who actually pays for this.
122	68 184 54 210 96 93 215 128 67 33 122	Those poor sailors are about to tump over. I sure hope someone can help them.
122	173 56 119 141 159 83 89 48 24 190 122	I'm sorry you were kicked out, hopefully there is something fun to do on the outside!
122	159 142 42 30 92 1 2 91 116 13 122	So sorry the race didn't go better for you! Hope the bike is fixed soon!
122	147 74 120 139 202 82 6 181 39 206 122	I hope the glass doesn't reflect sun into people's eyes.
122	113 121 209 71 64 73 109 92 104 198 122	I'm so sorry for your loss.
122	67 63 136 5 162 182 74 64 114 80 122	I feel sorry for anyone getting left out on this trip.
122	24 91 121 3 47 87 6 65 152 137 122	Ive always been good with kids, I have a younger brother as well.
122	157 90 123 174 141 10 32 13 215 131 122	Awww, I love a good wedding dance!
122	190 187 156 176 70 171 88 110 199 149 122	Poor flower is dying...
122	53 47 111 161 134 121 27 102 140 87 122	I admire her courage, but feel sorry for her sense of fashion.
122	98 124 106 10 79 172 213 54 147 195 122	I bet that bench is comfortable for all the moms walking their babies in the park.
122	113 34 192 126 141 64 13 173 8 103 122	The plaster work looks just as it did on the day it was built
122	150 14 173 164 45 143 131 136 134 30 122	Raising a baby is such hard work, hope it goes great for you!
122	15 34 19 114 132 85 16 93 28 173 122	I have tried biking uphill before, that is no fun.
122	73 148 53 172 64 151 170 34 23 184 122	I pity whomever spent money on this.
122	208 38 185 83 126 31 17 62 132 90 122	I feel bad for the people down there.
122	74 136 154 5 89 151 33 41 103 170 122	Poor little critter -- what kind of place is that for a wild animal.
122	89 1 39 147 95 127 7 206 4 46 122	Many times I feel bad for tree, as they are static and lonely!
122	106 162 44 100 173 48 188 199 64 147 122	I am sad for the tree sap.
122	25 151 109 39 71 178 48 162 94 101 122	I bet it took a long time in the hot sun to carve out this stone.
122	212 127 160 33 187 135 22 57 207 176 122	Poor guy, I too want to scream to the heavens when the bartender cuts me off.
122	115 71 79 108 92 123 103 2 126 99 122	This is what my mouth felt like after eating a ghost pepper.
122	19 195 150 212 52 172 121 58 175 167 122	This poor baby has nothing to do but people watch.
122	30 200 181 211 62 1 41 210 79 70 122	I feel for them.
122	103 31 215 204 201 171 14 88 48 181 122	That float looks amazing!
122	160 2 193 150 135 115 86 180 123 63 122	Those poor folks in the valley are probably tired of the cold, gray weather.
122	119 102 46 81 109 183 212 201 49 184 122	Awww, it's getting rained on.
122	87 65 92 35 116 129 119 124 125 105 122	Those trees are beautiful.
122	6 148 149 152 132 80 151 76 166 173 122	I hope the guys who's armour that is lived a long and happy life
122	90 193 188 73 106 181 34 172 176 100 122	I hope these two are rehearsing for something and not lonely and alone by themselves.
122	11 187 156 117 182 126 188 181 186 95 122	Poor thing can't keep a beat to save his life.  Bless his heart.
122	64 10 66 65 97 52 130 153 145 82 122	I feel sad for that flower.
122	46 12 121 82 157 187 129 153 27 43 122	Can't imagine how long and how much work it took the people at the factory to create such a shiny piece.
122	128 42 55 190 44 57 143 165 115 130 122	I feel bad for anyone who has land out in the midwest with zero natural resources
122	167 10 103 171 166 75 61 132 85 4 122	I feel bad for that tree surrounded by ugly buildings.
122	209 191 104 86 27 19 20 53 126 29 122	Man it looks hot, hope they cool down.
122	132 206 142 22 114 92 25 69 65 180 122	His back must hurt.
122	7 147 66 121 55 139 11 144 178 101 122	Aw, he must be blind - let's see if we can't help him.
122	183 192 150 101 114 42 185 6 142 188 122	It just wonderful to see a bunch of excited and young women engaging in team building activities.
122	37 64 181 214 51 25 103 185 47 65 122	How cute! i love this fountain!
122	64 164 159 72 191 68 39 89 209 27 122	It must be hard trying to make it as an abstract painter.
122	155 188 33 211 13 114 72 180 112 65 122	I feel for the loss of her happiness.
122	114 140 21 129 199 208 3 57 162 13 122	I hope that the dancing doesn't hurt your back too much.
122	180 6 185 65 183 210 51 21 15 13 122	I can't believe they make her stand there and pose in such ridiculous positions.
122	51 64 24 95 57 111 19 208 204 192 122	It's so sad that this pig has to live it's entire life with dwarfism.
122	191 142 203 97 32 156 49 129 50 160 122	These building really show the human creativity.
122	149 176 140 69 191 56 76 180 161 118 122	I feel you boys! i was young once! enjoy!
122	15 95 83 113 155 37 84 44 143 5 122	She looks lonely. I can share that
122	142 159 166 203 111 59 125 186 116 102 122	It looks so lonely..
122	210 175 195 49 71 124 2 192 81 22 122	Looks like a tragedy. I am so sorry for their loss.
122	185 177 165 175 64 102 200 60 103 148 122	I hope they're habitat isn't being destroyed
122	114 110 43 96 184 75 157 147 9 168 122	I am not aware of this book but it looks to be scary.
122	130 114 79 80 135 155 50 149 108 58 122	I think he's coming from a funeral.  How awful. Poor old man.  I hope he is doing okay.
122	177 137 165 123 31 198 82 193 32 94 122	Those poor people taking the train so late at night.  I hope they get home soon.
122	18 17 118 144 30 109 159 73 173 192 122	Monument, Arts where vacation take us
122	88 215 142 97 105 141 197 149 118 86 122	Hope he doesn't crash
122	174 95 31 82 203 87 179 144 88 75 122	I feel sorry for whoever didn't win
122	52 166 17 133 26 131 124 85 161 141 122	I hope it didn't rain when they played that game.
122	47 80 10 66 197 204 182 44 29 187 122	Those kids may not have parents...that is so sad.
122	138 31 168 43 56 211 169 95 52 108 122	I would not care if someone chose to lose their clothes here. Seems like a very private spot to strip at.
122	34 110 167 76 111 214 178 74 118 18 122	Supporting the troops is admirable. All those families who lose someone; its so sad.
122	193 29 31 1 213 12 56 77 19 13 122	This must have been an old tree, now dead. too bad.
122	46 26 66 94 96 70 69 106 131 38 122	Wow that tattoo looks so bad, I really hope they can get that improved or removed.
122	98 29 86 52 50 200 73 174 120 15 122	its very sympathetic game
122	97 115 53 91 209 116 79 24 47 165 122	Whoever wrote this must have taken a long time.
122	106 136 171 192 47 135 22 196 167 123 122	It's so sad that she looks like she really wanted some cake and icecream as well.
122	84 21 136 81 7 15 121 90 116 30 122	I can understand how it would feel to be in this desolate place. You're never truly alone though.
122	74 85 35 108 154 183 89 70 184 135 122	I can only imagine the days of the wild west, when most of America looked like this with no roads and an untouched wilderness.
122	102 3 207 75 30 64 160 98 43 128 122	fun, delightful, calm
122	144 142 93 104 157 8 87 135 61 183 122	I feel for the people who built this tower.
122	195 54 136 90 171 62 56 115 84 113 122	I feel bad for whoever is in charge of weeding this garden!
122	23 149 184 180 174 79 212 120 166 106 122	I hope they had a good time and are warm enough,
122	189 161 31 29 66 138 209 188 109 185 122	I feel for the building maker.
122	43 97 138 21 23 14 111 61 72 41 122	Sometimes we feel lonely in a group.
122	71 74 111 142 127 150 155 198 63 2 122	Oh, that purple stuff will stain.
122	173 24 213 7 61 162 116 63 46 20 122	We have lost a great soldier of our nation, rest in peace.
122	70 60 211 38 199 170 143 192 205 86 122	You can really feel the emotion in the painting of the boys face.
122	52 210 4 2 110 80 44 95 109 14 122	That poor dog just wants something to eat.
122	204 79 166 199 198 191 34 147 35 61 122	I hope this kid does well
122	157 212 153 63 65 68 76 79 179 174 122	This shade of green reminds me of all the people in the world who are suffering from preventable disease.
122	191 174 150 120 187 155 38 200 101 109 122	I wish that the room was more decorated and lively.
122	47 154 3 23 134 76 210 130 64 30 122	the town has less people since the kids graduation
122	198 28 185 2 16 163 151 212 148 147 122	It looks like the guy is thinking about how he feels in recent break up.
122	22 93 155 152 133 205 82 114 71 123 122	That embrace looks very special.
122	156 13 50 5 17 214 120 112 9 189 122	Christmas is a nice time of the year for everyone.
122	5 76 91 64 212 180 186 69 145 32 122	This poor playground looks abandoned. I wonder if it feels lonely.
122	27 131 169 120 194 212 176 118 85 19 122	I hope the snow doesn't pile up too much.
122	172 3 98 53 106 5 167 189 17 90 122	I feel for all of the family members and loved ones in this photo.
122	185 119 19 6 151 126 112 71 106 74 122	THE PEOPLES ARE SITTING ON SOFFA
122	8 6 119 16 4 113 54 53 48 179 122	Blue is a cool color and i like it.
122	206 119 81 64 69 129 89 86 66 204 122	Awww the poor lady lama never gets any camera time.
122	115 53 210 42 83 29 139 101 133 191 122	Some animals probably appreciate having that habitat.
122	90 106 94 139 31 178 138 114 41 1 122	I can understand why people like this shade of green.
122	67 175 153 148 126 209 193 147 96 33 122	It looks so cold for them!
122	15 19 34 45 210 197 48 55 192 171 122	I hope they have enough water
122	140 36 96 54 209 108 13 46 48 70 122	I bet they want more cake.
122	147 48 133 42 127 138 120 37 40 2 122	I saw these at a funeral once. What a beautiful color
122	17 101 213 53 203 158 126 88 209 31 122	I feel so bad for the people that have to hear what this guy has to say.
122	173 134 149 167 95 212 141 8 14 25 122	Aww that poor plant will never survive stuck in all that rock
122	27 188 77 177 57 141 75 63 176 24 122	Part of this property is quite overgrown, I hope the owners have not fallen on hard times.
122	209 120 170 93 199 65 79 127 96 3 122	oh what a shame that it's broken.
122	6 199 160 53 163 96 52 109 208 13 122	Despite the harsh conditions that this fllower goes through, it has managed to flourish beautifully.
122	203 198 184 72 155 103 75 207 14 68 122	I bet some gardeners spent a lot of time working on the plants around the gazebo.
122	92 156 66 152 153 135 192 56 64 111 122	I feel bad for these people having to shop this way
122	78 123 77 4 98 161 147 193 195 116 122	Growing old is unfortunate
122	153 182 162 15 47 171 88 77 177 51 122	This poor child is trapped on an airplane over night.
122	193 101 213 31 79 131 32 128 20 51 122	Poor guy lost his brother on this bridge the next day.
122	125 191 193 140 165 135 10 26 178 121 122	They look so bored
122	2 197 146 81 187 190 169 154 133 152 122	Beautiful photo. I would love to see it as a greeting card.
123	196 82 160 127 191 70 77 179 183 59 123	MOM AND SON ARE STANDING IN THE BEACH
123	177 151 124 66 180 26 203 114 93 39 123	This photograph is a good example of the rule of thirds.
123	75 129 205 168 59 100 72 90 180 60 123	The person who made the vase was very thorough.
123	37 146 44 105 65 107 36 32 143 161 123	Looks like an indigo
123	189 213 145 2 173 175 37 120 172 48 123	That car seems to have some damage.
123	1 173 5 112 54 25 176 67 140 157 123	this plate is not meticulous
123	119 166 55 5 150 56 113 180 130 135 123	he's going to want to make sure those boards line up, the look a little uneven.
123	200 117 119 183 174 92 213 148 129 62 123	It was at this spot where I counted out the many tomes the author inscribed.
123	95 120 177 77 44 169 55 92 48 65 123	I believe this historic site is one of great importance in the EU.
123	203 73 141 115 13 126 5 143 26 150 123	The man is very precise about where to walk the dog
123	100 171 154 116 16 146 72 207 185 117 123	that's very religious
123	23 145 59 7 109 16 211 80 87 193 123	The pictures are very thorough
123	170 76 53 49 157 88 153 20 160 140 123	I am sure you had fun at the party. I see your friends in the back. I don't know all of their names. I would like to meet them.
123	146 168 166 37 182 157 98 73 165 169 123	The tree placement is precise
123	121 110 125 94 114 66 176 109 36 8 123	While the dish may be delicious, the color palate of the nuts and vegetables is unappealing.
123	35 178 3 18 187 14 17 55 119 142 123	His stance is perfect, he'll certainly hit the ball.
123	156 35 147 31 40 209 191 143 36 186 123	You can see their reflection in the glass.
123	199 58 201 140 166 88 95 67 13 148 123	Very handsome young man with those chubby cheeks, sparkly eyes, button nose, and sweet grin.
123	31 22 169 194 86 11 175 141 214 51 123	The piano is a skill that requires immense amounts of practice.
123	31 120 192 46 60 26 64 23 71 7 123	Who are those people catching?
123	128 58 129 211 209 80 25 179 121 204 123	The guitar should be strummed string by string. Never missing a note.
123	23 214 43 180 205 160 181 212 97 27 123	A photograph of a photographer done in an artistic way. You have an eye for photos, thank you for posting.
123	95 117 174 109 51 47 44 208 31 164 123	They put a lot of fine details on this sculpture.
123	198 99 43 155 75 54 58 5 52 61 123	The bottles must be very thorough
123	9 212 185 114 18 108 184 176 71 105 123	He is sitting there looking as if he is contemplating his life. The car does not appear to be moving.
123	105 157 37 81 55 91 93 125 103 131 123	They look so happy and pleased. Those smiles and connection they clearly share is so strong
123	14 23 195 170 40 196 118 114 93 155 123	This is a neatly arranged noticeboard of a white rectangle superimposed over an America flag. It looks like the type of display one may encounter at  funeral service.
123	193 147 113 164 3 43 131 158 120 4 123	I lost my phone 30 degrees due south of this tunnel.
123	132 94 102 182 163 100 164 53 51 159 123	I'm trying to see what chord he's fretting.
123	144 135 155 31 61 188 76 192 99 54 123	This is known as a dragon fly.
123	133 56 170 103 197 41 4 163 89 187 123	While I enjoy the perspective of this picture and the subject matter that includes the buildings, the overall theme is lost because of the washed out color.
123	202 174 184 134 40 164 181 167 148 56 123	I see you are riding that wave at just the right peak! Great timing!
123	183 192 54 150 52 86 215 152 198 7 123	The blue coloring of this moth slowly mottles to brown at the edges.
123	148 177 209 34 86 208 109 8 201 14 123	The usage of the font Comic Sans for the name of "en voyage" was clearly a mistake since it looks messy.
123	125 143 11 102 165 95 10 41 17 214 123	The baby is clean, swaddled, and has had all its shots.
123	212 112 50 149 172 63 87 191 37 169 123	I wouldn't eat this meal because it does not fit in the plate. Try again, cook.
123	124 4 46 207 180 12 82 143 215 178 123	This church is located nicely for the parish.
123	122 194 15 78 53 99 56 76 114 132 123	This shows a great display of standing up to discrimination. Those candles represent those that are suffering for who they are. My thoughts are with them
123	26 136 205 167 116 142 155 201 122 11 123	What an interesting insect.
123	202 146 72 62 37 205 108 61 69 28 123	It is lovely the way they are crystal clear and the background is blurry. It gives a chance for the viewer to see the girls beautiful red hair that is nice and shiney and to see the mans crisp blue shirt and his warming smile.
123	214 50 197 146 64 108 59 165 7 125 123	The detail on those columns are top notch.
123	166 108 168 53 122 80 189 86 62 54 123	What a clean building, I wish mine was that clean.
123	61 98 22 128 64 209 51 147 59 170 123	Oh this needs to be extingushed fast so no one gets hurt!
123	183 121 132 158 3 108 23 4 41 190 123	Those stairs are actually different heights.
123	8 144 53 49 44 28 203 210 130 13 123	Her style matches, although the colors vary.
123	188 179 147 97 65 122 154 131 75 25 123	wow beautiful place and people
123	4 197 7 35 126 6 164 207 116 107 123	the dance moves have to be exact
123	108 109 147 146 55 13 214 202 209 71 123	There are two people in the room

123	144 103 202 139 104 32 55 36 84 16 123	The photo of this building is very well angled.
123	176 131 137 65 184 136 94 81 158 186 123	This is a beautiful photo. It looks like a very peaceful place with the stone building and fountain and the restaurant off to the side.
123	148 159 62 207 163 84 171 149 112 20 123	You can tell the man on the right is the center of attention.
123	9 30 171 7 12 97 96 44 145 86 123	This looks like someone was trying to make binoculars out of a few pieces of trash.
123	62 18 17 43 158 48 101 68 93 169 123	This photo is unacceptable. Christopher's hair isn't combed properly, and there is sand on his shoulder.

123	189 107 18 68 174 173 39 146 204 184 123	The fact that the edges of the glass balcony don't line up with the walls is irritating.
123	177 36 134 81 12 70 174 157 182 58 123	There are 18 pieces of that candy to be wrapped
123	18 205 142 148 70 199 73 117 166 74 123	They should really check their bike chains, they look a little bit dirty but even that is unacceptable.
123	209 28 52 148 213 140 37 102 27 157 123	It looks like these people wanted to get into this baseball game.
123	110 41 112 80 134 119 201 133 178 69 123	I just love your wine grass and purple dress.
123	118 58 76 13 55 156 133 141 21 162 123	I love the attention to detail within the costume.  You can really see it in the flamingo
123	26 126 125 27 163 140 79 98 88 42 123	Would having a walk in the rain be a good idea?
123	199 12 16 112 176 172 151 141 80 33 123	Old farmer equipment
123	45 145 30 127 70 209 192 56 21 141 123	Now this is a man. He's got flowers, a scarf, and a smile.
123	135 20 168 39 111 102 118 108 88 23 123	The smile she has on her face could be more genuine like his.
123	180 210 127 139 155 116 196 29 115 164 123	That one plant is slightly off center they should fix it.
123	126 157 215 191 209 30 205 60 24 94 123	Who would sleep on the cold,dirty ground?
123	178 116 71 148 78 140 38 154 39 57 123	Need more light in the picture
123	28 186 160 29 124 155 150 176 27 126 123	The cheetah should not be confused with the leopard, as the two are very different.
123	188 189 129 198 186 91 106 165 45 157 123	This must be a large traffic jam, always happening in large cities when people are leaving work.
123	11 138 118 89 61 86 145 47 188 42 123	I love the way her hat, scarf and jacket are all colour coordinating!
123	194 35 137 198 15 168 75 13 158 204 123	I have counted each of these leaves.
123	44 83 158 67 208 82 188 16 212 91 123	it must be cold and windy there
123	48 100 24 176 101 58 103 177 111 85 123	All I can think while looking at this photo is that guy should have a highlighter!
123	96 102 130 90 183 83 100 184 124 8 123	I don't play with people
123	73 179 132 192 157 127 29 101 35 21 123	This looks like a good firm handshake between these two gentlemen.
123	36 26 174 6 4 17 124 34 90 39 123	Gotta make sure to shoot them right between the eyes, otherwise you might as well not even be shooting.
123	102 76 163 197 183 45 174 74 104 172 123	Her hair looks nice and pristine, just like I prefer.
123	49 57 151 36 161 97 35 129 100 126 123	This is an engaging moment, the signing of the certificate. Things are official and complete.
123	38 175 183 73 144 141 89 212 126 62 123	a sharp bend
123	207 45 141 73 61 194 68 40 12 215 123	The jagedness of certain rock parts really makes this picture pop

123	98 194 49 76 168 72 149 19 18 90 123	A man speaking on a different type of solution to life.
123	89 193 6 130 40 167 205 85 132 135 123	There's too many random strewn about on the table, I'd sort them nice and neat!
123	148 38 8 69 68 205 18 137 146 126 123	i hope that monkey has enough space in that cage. if its too small , they should be reported.
123	64 212 22 187 166 53 58 86 98 54 123	that just bugs me that the top of her head is missing.
123	104 50 69 106 85 14 191 33 145 24 123	sunny, blurry, calm
123	201 60 78 62 14 126 88 4 187 90 123	The park manager pays particular attention to detail to ensure the park plaza is always clean and inviting.
123	46 1 94 24 160 10 7 6 168 205 123	The image came out exactly as I hoped. It took many hours to adjust the aperture to reflect the perfect amount of light.
123	114 194 78 2 25 63 190 20 27 66 123	His suit is very dapper for this event.
123	147 45 175 138 131 152 165 18 20 72 123	He will fall hard into the water.
123	184 76 198 214 94 117 186 114 30 160 123	There must be a lot of people in this race.
123	125 13 79 213 177 8 107 153 112 150 123	This is very careful architecture.
123	101 104 36 53 116 87 77 153 151 188 123	Though it is a morbid scene, I really appreciate the arrangement of flowers. They really balanced the number of roses with amount of greenery perfectly.
123	35 202 37 180 169 188 159 20 53 201 123	The water looks so peaceful.
123	109 122 6 24 44 79 33 102 59 72 123	Lots of blurry lights
123	62 204 106 181 30 179 136 46 140 145 123	Must scoop up every piece of snow

123	64 76 200 185 176 12 124 130 5 63 123	Each fold and curve in the fabric of their garments hits the light in the perfect way each time.
123	206 42 146 64 139 190 48 38 204 26 123	Interesting cosplay... from the leather boots, leggings, shorts, leather jacket, to the blue wig
123	19 71 63 109 3 139 82 173 60 178 123	This is more than a dafety hazard. Each one of those metak bars look like it is on its last leg.

123	19 204 41 22 154 49 45 136 119 17 123	They arranged themselves so methodically for this picture.
123	29 24 34 28 50 203 85 36 175 13 123	Detailing is an art form.
123	209 91 132 190 70 21 174 18 8 95 123	I think I see some brown in this
123	7 178 98 125 116 21 77 79 203 104 123	That concrete work is really smoothly done
123	107 37 32 110 109 1 79 172 148 214 123	So many details, it's hard to focus on each one

123	196 164 194 191 214 40 33 29 193 169 123	There are approximately 37 perfect right angles
124	206 102 185 141 164 46 72 37 184 160 124	Thats a nice day but it looks too cold.
124	103 157 128 86 12 19 13 29 15 2 124	Amazing art but very dirty.
124	56 162 175 119 78 137 213 153 32 71 124	very different designs between the ceiling and the structure.
124	74 93 171 84 100 177 144 215 77 59 124	Fun game but baseball is boring.
124	20 80 55 167 141 81 135 18 27 9 124	The people have apposed the offer.
124	66 54 191 169 126 166 92 39 71 29 124	Berries are delicious, but for the birds.
124	56 12 81 51 164 170 140 156 11 103 124	Nice place but super dirty.
124	39 92 35 200 27 74 57 175 30 90 124	Good job on your head shot! Although you probably should have worked with better light.
124	35 113 81 205 146 98 149 57 162 13 124	The views are opposed to the normal
124	150 75 37 84 68 154 174 136 212 183 124	You can't really be that tired.
124	29 136 125 165 89 94 115 110 100 22 124	He might get hurt, ok he can play
124	205 159 197 128 171 75 109 129 59 149 124	smokey, cautious, dangerous
124	100 155 14 139 190 40 24 175 172 84 124	This is a nice church but it smells.
124	205 101 57 150 90 127 191 120 176 131 124	The best cleaning seems to happen in the dirtiest water.
124	23 74 82 35 72 129 202 60 9 100 124	I like all cars, just not this one.
124	87 8 199 59 181 101 80 205 159 65 124	Blue is my favorite color but I like purple here the best.
124	70 183 81 108 41 55 192 94 47 111 124	Those buildings don't belong there.
124	50 12 43 151 45 15 213 202 172 106 124	Why doesn't the floor and the wall match? If you used the same wood, this would look a lot better. Also, the framing of the pic is crooked.
124	20 100 32 191 183 110 84 40 79 87 124	This picture looks amazing with the light fluffy clouds, almost like a painting though it's really dumb since you can't see the sky or tips of the mountains.
124	111 175 146 36 137 195 208 104 75 145 124	I know that is a giant frog in the middle.
124	215 132 130 16 168 203 113 186 200 100 124	I hate street art. This is a wonderful piece of work.
124	171 47 50 206 121 40 11 72 46 165 124	He should never drive without his hands on the wheel it isn't safe. He should at least use his knee.
124	117 103 144 164 15 32 163 183 120 58 124	I would love to visit this place, but I am not a fan of walking and there are no cars for transportation in many parts of the city.
124	88 63 55 30 194 49 143 1 187 113 124	Why do they have to have different color tiles, its not very flattering
124	147 87 46 32 26 155 100 164 86 18 124	They said no rain today. Cloudy
124	5 75 178 145 13 105 10 87 138 215 124	This bridge made it possible for people to cross.
124	21 119 18 32 79 157 47 82 108 90 124	Those are pretty smiles but they are kind of ugly.
124	19 159 109 147 22 62 46 141 100 74 124	this is a boy
124	90 73 114 168 43 62 177 203 170 158 124	Sweet smile, yet is it true?
124	102 77 99 165 6 149 138 120 1 7 124	Standing in the road is never a good idea.
124	74 67 21 184 198 97 153 25 142 195 124	Why are there so many dead trees in the garden?
124	100 59 167 64 202 11 44 172 40 32 124	The old statues are looking new
124	94 48 150 85 73 195 42 15 203 121 124	Oh why does she still have the tag on if she bought the shirt?
124	133 66 147 144 208 104 31 108 28 9 124	How is he completely dry in the snow?
124	127 146 59 154 75 25 83 12 61 129 124	I think the train track no longer functions.
124	70 118 55 24 15 172 58 135 62 106 124	I am undecided on if I like the plane
124	172 95 117 107 149 106 98 199 131 163 124	This day looks warm but the water looks so cold.
124	125 82 177 131 105 110 70 103 191 185 124	This cop car should be catching a bad guy.
124	101 166 150 180 86 17 37 27 177 191 124	A dry or autumn season
124	164 4 162 126 5 156 3 19 215 90 124	A cute bear
124	208 73 130 87 77 52 22 81 89 8 124	I thought this was the way to the beach but once I got to the end of the path it had just looped around.
124	86 141 190 163 195 31 16 162 77 174 124	Nice muscles on the trumpet
124	191 104 40 43 71 29 65 96 86 202 124	Why is this train paused? It should move at all times.
124	1 178 6 94 39 48 52 92 30 137 124	Many people may think this bird is pretty, but I think it's pretty ugly.
124	97 159 72 187 50 157 61 121 2 19 124	i like veggies but not green beans.
124	177 48 138 183 154 134 1 102 8 60 124	THe flower is on dirt
124	193 9 102 99 103 82 170 37 1 116 124	There is grass on bare land
124	104 140 43 89 126 152 203 17 171 44 124	Cats but they're people?
124	20 65 64 180 125 56 115 97 192 162 124	I can't say I do and i can't say I don't like the collors
124	110 16 6 162 112 97 210 82 200 156 124	I completely disagree with the topic of this article.
124	187 147 213 29 99 5 96 204 3 118 124	I hate pubs - but wouldn't mind going here!
124	165 20 68 106 166 105 211 70 215 75 124	That's really gross...
124	24 49 107 159 150 20 75 123 58 25 124	Light can only escape if we let them.
124	129 209 146 165 184 67 58 108 40 28 124	I don't really like this statue. Personally, I prefer statues with babies on it.
124	125 77 35 129 164 205 122 17 120 24 124	What is that squirrel doing anyway?
124	209 16 184 169 196 163 70 79 178 206 124	These safety lines take away all the fun and enjoyment of this sport.
124	176 45 101 136 178 135 88 32 34 171 124	It might be daylight here.
124	110 55 149 52 106 54 39 153 58 197 124	Why walk when you can ride. Get in the car !
124	137 211 39 213 177 75 113 152 118 97 124	This doesn't look fun at all
124	86 57 84 27 40 169 135 201 29 104 124	This is wet or dry.
124	81 20 117 177 118 157 141 29 27 214 124	He was the best president but not.
124	147 134 172 132 48 207 190 203 34 126 124	Where is mom in this picture? Is she helping?
124	202 123 96 95 36 130 90 159 167 37 124	Those bulbs look like apples.
124	89 178 118 45 71 191 7 25 166 105 124	No, we're not going anywhere.
124	137 27 54 60 92 77 34 69 138 36 124	she looks alright but a little tough on the eyes.
124	26 78 52 142 115 178 86 170 162 197 124	people say elephants throw dirt on themselves to rid of bug but i think they are praying to their god
124	172 6 88 194 31 57 175 181 80 130 124	The house has a modern design.
124	177 34 101 153 26 78 10 55 97 195 124	Who is going to go out dressed like that?
124	128 15 115 58 5 8 174 54 202 181 124	This picture looks so good and clear even though it's super blurry
124	104 189 179 121 195 7 185 119 184 113 124	He looks smart but not.
124	149 129 76 206 152 178 133 70 111 131 124	I don't think they won
124	105 200 94 206 62 78 59 34 185 176 124	I would love some good candy and nuts.  Then again, these are in a wheelbarrow.  I don't want any food.
124	59 208 60 83 141 27 107 176 87 100 124	This is a fancy restroom or is it?
124	82 180 186 7 136 99 185 109 4 134 124	Looks nice and simple and kind of a mess.
124	214 17 102 29 178 165 187 177 188 167 124	What a tall steel bridge; it looks sturdy but I bet it isn't up to code.
124	3 90 72 7 73 126 10 177 162 80 124	He is walking the wrong way for succor and sustenance,
124	172 102 152 40 153 11 199 193 167 156 124	I don't think beer is good. Beer isn't meant to be tangerine flavored.
124	199 206 32 15 69 173 154 35 131 148 124	Everyone should play team sports, but women shouldn't play basketball.
124	114 120 79 10 51 7 62 83 44 123 124	He looks cute...except for the fact I'm staring right up his nose.
124	70 117 86 208 125 133 105 16 169 143 124	This is not a good picture, but it also kind of is.
124	193 57 99 206 10 14 21 147 170 214 124	The crane is tall, the crane is short.
124	181 9 168 6 47 197 36 154 115 139 124	Maybe rocks and maybe just chunks of cement.
124	61 15 86 185 78 175 44 126 67 79 124	I want to pretend like life is not interesting, but I just took a lot of time setting up this filtered insta shoot.
124	38 4 171 210 17 34 160 10 6 20 124	This many notes will not help this person, only confuse them.
124	71 85 105 142 139 89 31 209 215 75 124	I don't think this bus holds as many as you would think.
124	90 46 132 93 129 72 50 209 38 55 124	Sun is not the right for water.
124	162 95 44 92 63 210 112 9 140 54 124	Fresh? Frozen in a truck? which is it?
124	12 36 163 92 27 186 128 9 162 215 124	What a waste of good real estate.
124	157 211 206 176 171 193 20 86 83 70 124	More is better in most cases.
124	180 109 49 99 119 35 194 5 84 1 124	Butting heads will solve all of our problems.
124	170 177 62 131 93 20 66 187 114 106 124	That glass wall isn't really glass.
124	66 47 174 64 140 10 166 115 100 89 124	This place looks abandoned yet there are cars in the parking lot.
124	103 112 197 82 88 22 41 134 69 68 124	The world is exploding in fire while this jeep drives off untouched.
124	97 135 63 215 167 46 74 199 144 126 124	In reality, she's the beast, and this image isn't as accurate as you may think.
124	128 200 142 35 108 113 110 83 174 163 124	I keep telling myself to exercise, yet I don't.
124	158 203 39 20 201 211 44 4 147 69 124	I love this building its so unlovable
124	182 189 186 127 121 162 178 104 139 164 124	If you are so sleepy why are you out and about?
124	175 118 186 81 69 121 38 130 6 60 124	She looks very pretty but I bet she is mean
124	99 186 62 153 104 146 66 191 188 179 124	I know the world loves soccer, but th only interst I have in the game is watching th refs throw flags
124	172 21 5 214 164 162 155 83 163 125 124	I know you said those are poppy plants, but they assuredly are not.
124	160 53 1 176 141 83 130 164 132 148 124	I want to like those people, but I can't -- they're wearing shorts with winter hats!
124	165 132 42 211 191 76 166 172 135 91 124	What a violent game! That referee is getting too close. Knock him out of the way!
124	149 3 131 42 183 49 4 14 115 126 124	That bass player should really try guitar. Its far better.
124	53 172 15 31 72 38 149 169 203 95 124	That robot is human or is it?
124	144 166 63 149 18 207 194 188 114 54 124	This tree did not get snowed on
124	194 157 126 103 38 153 117 154 156 161 124	Ugh. It's so sad that mountaintop removal keeps stripping those hills. Soon, we'll have none left. Tourism doesn't help, either.
124	67 113 58 111 101 140 163 196 93 33 124	It was a beautiful event. Let me tell you what could have made it better.
124	149 157 3 36 89 46 196 90 70 25 124	This looks like some place that I've been to, well a little like it
124	120 26 105 12 98 53 178 102 91 14 124	If humans wearing clothes are people, then are dogs wearing clothes also people?
124	90 96 101 131 113 1 122 180 46 8 124	How many guys does it take to dig a hole? I would think two, but maybe three?
124	193 101 210 28 36 14 63 24 122 130 124	It's a man-made building but covered in nature, can't get more contradictory than that!
124	62 51 145 30 25 115 165 206 55 37 124	This looks scrumptious, but I think green tea is disgusting.
124	167 87 43 32 141 15 5 214 170 144 124	Athletic but wearing a shirt too small.
124	135 190 152 201 200 209 83 202 26 34 124	What is he smiling about? Nothing good, I'm sure.
124	49 93 205 186 195 200 54 198 33 121 124	Hope both the red team and the white team wins so at least one of my teams win!
124	195 38 12 68 117 105 46 26 2 119 124	They probably just use him for moeny
124	139 197 97 99 17 81 20 170 176 13 124	She looks amazing, but that dress is horrible.  She needs to do her hair better, too.
124	174 155 177 197 170 191 201 41 62 28 124	Clearly the gate doesn't do anything to prevent crime. That door is filthy.
124	166 93 109 65 150 125 202 41 59 42 124	My favorite genre of TV is Science Fiction. My least favorite tv show is Star Trek
124	183 15 108 37 191 169 161 50 143 139 124	This is a moist environment.
124	204 73 148 50 70 79 39 112 120 157 124	Not a waffle cone
124	16 126 198 21 161 160 107 29 53 112 124	No, that's not a balloon, it's a blimp.
124	149 62 198 122 197 212 164 80 69 25 124	i would roll in the grass but i hate grass.
124	127 104 111 141 156 84 125 99 214 39 124	I prefer dry vacation destinations.
124	22 29 53 159 149 200 113 60 92 127 124	I like blue but its my least favorite color.
124	145 196 13 17 69 8 38 2 49 95 124	I don't like his music, but he seems like a good artist.
124	23 167 40 25 10 30 71 54 41 66 124	That brick is a nice color, but it's pretty ugly.
124	77 199 25 135 171 155 154 205 160 170 124	The water is sharp!
124	22 104 167 182 91 150 83 6 154 72 124	I much rather visit a big city. I love giant skyscrapers and the bustle of society.
124	104 93 195 130 36 156 84 194 7 42 124	I hate hair like this. Just screams attention.
124	93 58 79 78 50 90 128 52 141 182 124	I promise that this is the best purchase you'll ever make.
124	34 105 132 180 214 18 19 5 163 22 124	She is sad or is she?
124	116 214 86 203 59 46 82 9 121 4 124	This doesn't look good. Why would someone make this.
124	150 33 57 65 121 197 93 177 172 101 124	The men loaded the plane ready to jump instead of waiting to put them on during flight.
124	39 200 202 12 132 128 209 55 28 137 124	I don't know how people enjoy skiing - it looks like a lot of work for a dangerous sport.
124	84 184 16 40 17 197 70 125 109 168 124	I do not like blue yet I really like the blue cup on the table.
124	178 90 91 165 173 5 151 209 63 79 124	Red is my favorite color, but I hate it,
124	198 118 3 46 37 82 212 108 203 177 124	The guy in the green seems like a great person, but I don't know if I'd want to spend any time with him in the same room.
124	137 140 149 199 20 215 113 118 152 185 124	Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?  Not me.
124	23 51 14 160 44 96 22 174 214 120 124	The group of girls look pretty, I guess they are not too bad looking
124	91 132 159 43 47 56 69 9 93 198 124	This kid needs to stop wasting time posting stuff on the internet.
124	145 51 144 213 190 5 39 205 47 33 124	This isn't lasagna
124	164 80 172 82 154 186 174 25 185 162 124	This home is beautiful.. NOT !
124	212 189 134 54 161 63 160 190 211 51 124	A rainbow without the rain is contrasting with the river!
124	189 103 87 8 120 76 20 152 202 127 124	Reveals the talent
124	64 84 195 212 109 68 139 186 113 83 124	Some of these words are backwards. I hate crosswords like that.
124	82 190 60 91 7 95 162 199 185 83 124	That's kind of pretty but looks fuzzy, it could be poison ivy.
124	175 32 26 50 193 151 119 142 61 174 124	I like shooting stars and all, but I would rather see something that could inspire me to dream more
124	4 50 13 83 137 178 190 102 171 77 124	Now why would you show me such an ugly, skinny bird when i asked for a pretty bird?
124	82 29 213 105 125 39 199 61 98 162 124	This young child is smarter than all of us.
124	130 118 95 208 128 133 129 202 47 76 124	is this a mirror image or 2 people dressed the same?
124	138 173 119 3 115 155 120 28 93 172 124	Those stools look uncomfortable, but I really want to try sitting on them.
124	9 89 146 20 66 4 95 180 103 28 124	i dont think that boy looks much like his dad at all.
124	177 200 151 158 22 159 16 183 119 59 124	Is she standing or is she?

124	130 97 28 117 76 121 101 95 47 179 124	What great ballroom dancing
124	67 195 58 57 155 77 169 26 117 48 124	I bet he can't even play guitar. He looks like he can though.
124	45 145 120 175 8 130 169 182 31 43 124	These flowers say spring but the bushes do not.
124	68 176 28 114 50 179 46 204 112 200 124	They having an important conversation or not.
124	17 112 108 55 39 34 79 129 49 41 124	He shouldn't be holding his guitar like that.
124	85 50 31 173 77 60 100 27 172 55 124	dangerous, fun, sporty
124	47 66 156 206 60 151 143 54 42 14 124	These are not football players!
124	34 103 22 49 73 6 204 19 102 199 124	Cupcakes are not love, they are hate.
124	43 80 41 152 20 37 140 147 179 25 124	War offered us a chance to examine our conflicting morals
124	91 105 50 138 95 179 79 213 167 112 124	Why couldn't this have been a black cat?
124	134 85 106 190 61 136 113 189 14 73 124	Maybe I'll ski on the right side.  No, I think the left side is better
124	18 46 19 122 89 72 25 39 3 106 124	Her dress is short
124	59 173 211 194 191 131 141 40 3 176 124	the flowers are dead but will bloom in the spring
124	156 215 91 148 160 127 98 202 40 183 124	One of these don't look like a dutch pie.
124	111 159 202 118 28 36 184 146 10 93 124	He looks attractive and homeless.
124	161 157 82 11 110 204 76 154 128 41 124	This animal is cute but looks like it would stab you to death with his horns.
124	55 170 128 7 156 157 66 37 161 158 124	I would be here if I was paid, i am a big volunteer person.
124	186 163 47 73 20 196 206 31 25 120 124	This is supposed to clarify but it doesn't.
124	129 172 103 162 168 60 19 102 151 139 124	He's half way out of the door.
124	176 190 9 200 171 196 194 83 160 212 124	The image could be gray or black and white.
124	1 43 27 35 3 50 139 65 60 53 124	do they need to have two flags in this picture?
124	179 19 53 94 111 80 69 66 78 85 124	Those people look like they're dancing the Charlston.
124	48 189 83 182 146 164 54 42 179 201 124	Don't get in the boat, just let it go!
124	189 46 203 174 70 94 95 44 45 167 124	Looks really nice but terrible
124	68 172 63 10 113 119 210 177 91 92 124	Children hate shadow puppets.
124	127 132 106 82 5 99 176 198 11 7 124	I love native americans!! I don't like their hair style thi
124	200 112 147 156 123 59 151 145 74 94 124	The village looks like an interesting place to visit, but I prefer staying on the water.
124	189 70 62 98 87 204 101 55 21 140 124	All the cars are facing the same way, except the ones that aren't
124	162 81 133 207 31 117 106 167 172 184 124	I like how the colors match
124	203 142 4 189 178 52 64 109 87 73 124	I have a guitar just like that. Er, I mean a piano. Wait, uh ...
124	4 162 155 72 89 163 114 18 45 122 124	Those red cows are the color green.
124	59 29 144 121 77 71 65 57 150 20 124	It's important to stay warm in cold climates, so they really shouldn't be wearing coats.
124	69 33 17 199 127 165 197 213 93 115 124	Why are they doing this,its 2018
125	198 112 30 49 120 177 89 3 16 107 125	The waitress was open minded when I ordered the drink
125	9 147 146 172 189 32 116 193 150 130 125	The innocence of the holidays is so refreshing to see! Oh, unless this is a very ancient Elf?! Oh my, she better get back to WORK!
125	101 9 26 43 5 134 63 114 175 153 125	This would be a great location to start our own community. We could be free of traditional goverment.
125	210 78 45 182 137 37 200 174 176 26 125	It must be late since no one is out.
125	97 120 177 4 91 110 188 92 123 121 125	The city has so much opportunity you can move here and start fresh with no past judgment.
125	204 50 164 104 81 19 205 24 109 184 125	Fall is a time of death and new beginnings
125	11 1 66 131 103 198 80 203 12 215 125	These kids have questions
125	136 147 114 121 12 19 4 181 96 162 125	I bet this clock stops working a lot.
125	195 139 215 214 95 138 197 131 10 203 125	This is a picture of purple, the color of freedom.
125	107 213 25 5 159 16 169 193 40 178 125	That would look fantastic tie-dyed.
125	168 175 27 92 48 104 152 161 69 123 125	What lovely drawings, must be an artist in the making!
125	137 187 15 9 122 61 57 73 132 197 125	Cities like these, make me think of futures to come, where megacities will likely reign, and the suburbs will cease to be.
125	47 127 207 144 19 50 102 110 82 87 125	Take a left turn, and follow the green car.
125	17 57 190 98 108 102 185 69 100 120 125	Growing your own plants and food is empowering.
125	76 212 211 65 18 139 199 1 78 214 125	Oh what a beautiful ocean. So relaxing.
125	192 190 186 90 145 187 41 116 163 103 125	I wonder what is happening on the island in the distance.
125	166 25 108 97 16 129 82 152 66 35 125	This image is so blurry it's like being on a trip.
125	143 200 63 41 26 170 147 2 62 142 125	Walking barefoot on the beach and pondering my horizons.
125	85 56 181 82 22 136 214 83 147 208 125	What a lively business, i'd love to go here!
125	95 213 174 108 60 196 50 140 165 168 125	I cant wait to publish my own book
125	103 56 6 150 99 84 206 213 181 199 125	What an innovative sign.
125	56 165 62 44 136 60 42 91 5 35 125	Ooh, I look forward to all the wonderful circus acts tonight. So many talented artists are acrobats.
125	140 201 212 79 163 196 123 37 214 159 125	How many people have climbed this over the years?
125	32 155 177 110 102 160 137 201 208 40 125	I love how the patterns of these hand woven rugs remind me of the times we used them to make love under the open skies.
125	103 110 157 99 34 105 124 64 180 193 125	We should be more like dogs.
125	18 16 209 98 5 110 38 184 99 132 125	If only I felt so light I could walk on a bush.
125	68 161 131 25 154 157 101 198 168 207 125	You can tell these guys have spent a tremendous amount of time perfecting their craft
125	202 184 30 198 123 159 131 211 139 109 125	Looks like fun for a workout!
125	134 168 118 2 66 15 11 206 169 124 125	very interesting and opens up a part of the brain that is awarding
125	162 87 172 177 161 25 165 213 173 188 125	Everything we build crumbles to natures immense strength.
125	104 136 153 88 38 12 208 159 167 87 125	It's amazing how so many different colors and materials can be captured in one simple photograph of a piece of wood.
125	52 107 21 93 127 95 105 152 69 172 125	The wonders of modern technology are all around us!
125	48 207 2 203 6 188 103 61 184 197 125	I can go a little faster, there aren't ant cops out.
125	133 210 105 172 205 195 22 206 179 14 125	Why can't different kinds of birds just hang out at the pool together?
125	86 13 99 126 184 100 8 119 180 39 125	This could be a clue to a passageway.
125	42 165 194 139 160 142 138 177 18 80 125	This man may never get drunk.
125	143 160 118 26 15 154 37 169 84 205 125	That boy is so brave for growing his hair out long. Two thumbs up for not conforming to society!
125	159 169 196 153 84 155 40 183 142 74 125	Yeah what a diverse band
125	81 207 24 102 36 195 182 173 18 189 125	Another rock to climb
125	127 50 35 184 178 169 9 204 88 140 125	Walking is good for the soul.
125	141 78 111 136 117 112 211 152 61 144 125	Absolutely love this shot! I can imagine how good the waves feel against her legs :)
125	24 86 184 73 174 102 36 148 78 124 125	Organized sports, what a ridiculous activity. It would be better if they were disorganized sports and everyone could play whatever game they wanted.
125	136 179 82 166 165 174 92 117 172 156 125	This is complicated if you don't free your mind to the task.
125	60 55 209 133 52 26 176 85 16 214 125	That looks so spooky to me
125	126 122 103 56 50 84 34 145 193 52 125	This river view makes me want to write a poem.
125	18 165 100 44 33 199 126 136 119 92 125	I wonder how fast the train is going to go past this crosswalk.
125	68 183 109 141 39 76 127 89 13 160 125	I wonder why there are vines on the building?
125	74 162 160 110 8 91 132 153 193 143 125	Are those windows meant to move? I bet those are also solar panels, somehow.
125	118 74 153 18 114 161 21 138 141 2 125	we should be able to fly any flag and do what ever we want.
125	71 12 183 83 213 161 193 137 56 169 125	What a bunch of free spirits!
125	91 68 200 6 203 110 84 130 30 85 125	The orange is in it to win it with that high kick!
125	117 205 189 87 166 200 46 173 194 95 125	all of these nations together gives us hope for the futre
125	25 141 55 100 120 195 32 24 166 210 125	This bridge makes me want to write a poem.
125	36 140 156 162 16 141 105 45 3 134 125	She is a free spirit.
125	156 149 166 132 62 199 140 210 76 54 125	I want to just sit here and write a poem.
125	35 32 110 174 214 36 176 25 173 59 125	This must be a sign of power.
125	37 140 172 91 161 25 188 67 8 115 125	really nice image
125	135 54 27 189 137 82 46 31 58 55 125	This hotel room looks clean and sparse - a good place to relax and unwind.
125	130 152 196 108 212 17 207 120 156 172 125	I wonder what may have been here before the cafe, as it seems to be such a historic and charming city block.
125	147 176 140 215 19 80 34 117 187 198 125	Glad there getting some fresh air.
125	176 55 119 132 7 207 142 23 213 115 125	The way she looks with such confidence shows that she is dressed for herself, no one else.
125	134 115 117 16 189 172 151 140 185 142 125	This could be my opportunity to crate an amazing painting.
125	206 91 158 88 169 162 119 28 71 141 125	My beliefs are my own.
125	41 54 178 25 106 146 122 14 95 185 125	The plants are growing ever forward and up, just like we need to be!
125	185 1 84 207 160 180 61 22 7 196 125	Love this, world peace and love!
125	99 21 29 35 44 14 153 175 213 56 125	I'd love to create a mural with this design.
125	7 181 116 165 126 131 38 134 157 30 125	Health food and good budget go together.
125	193 44 194 5 155 61 167 22 137 168 125	A tiny kitchen for this tiny home is a fun, liberating way to live life free of possessions that tie us down
125	54 4 46 60 51 132 81 100 111 48 125	Each house is a different color, just like each person is a unique individual
125	16 151 170 81 104 105 77 173 122 131 125	It is great to to see heterosexual couples still getting married.
125	67 138 88 192 150 58 201 130 77 115 125	I wouldn't want to travel in that snow.
125	205 168 169 130 87 120 144 10 18 187 125	The ambiance here makes you dive into your world of thoughts and just wander around them
125	124 173 204 160 179 64 201 183 10 19 125	Very interesting piece, so much to be taken from it
125	214 195 161 113 93 178 107 198 169 73 125	You never know who might come up with the cure for cancer.
125	116 174 114 208 57 105 181 204 51 39 125	What an interesting hat you have there
125	82 131 110 213 167 145 148 25 24 43 125	Looks like they're having a good time. I wonder what event they are at.
125	174 43 3 18 116 81 109 158 132 29 125	I love wide open spaces.
125	133 161 195 112 20 147 21 209 84 188 125	I love a cherry red car interior!
125	185 107 79 109 165 90 134 81 97 142 125	If this were powered by electricity, it would be a handy little car
125	183 106 149 36 102 60 75 179 27 17 125	I think this place is full of serenity.
125	41 13 33 101 108 183 193 49 74 32 125	It baffles me that these religions still uphold all of these archaic rituals and traditions that serve no purpose.
125	70 185 12 82 88 188 204 210 183 67 125	We're losing the race, pedal faster.
125	113 142 133 24 192 72 169 155 152 29 125	It is nice to see young people getting involved in social topics especially to stay healthy.
125	124 102 170 68 109 183 114 155 54 1 125	The guy is taller then the kid
125	190 64 85 198 94 189 169 11 179 172 125	These boys will grow up to be great leaders.

125	139 92 18 8 72 129 82 126 131 166 125	I am as freethinking as the storm.
125	118 133 177 126 131 148 74 58 14 212 125	Dinner date out
125	43 133 46 126 81 141 143 47 100 127 125	A massive game of Jenga
125	109 140 137 154 102 47 67 127 182 126 125	I wonder what all of these people are doing here for. If they truly wish to be there and what their overall values are no matter what they might state in public
125	153 194 99 142 174 27 112 22 106 184 125	Beautiful to have trees in there. much better place

125	2 132 172 78 141 131 81 179 126 77 125	That place looks dry, you can just see how little moisture there is on that dry, rocky ground.
125	113 209 197 164 140 92 12 119 31 85 125	This could be nice after after class coffee spot.. for a fee, of course.

125	198 158 109 61 52 75 202 70 133 87 125	When I see purple, I imagine that I have just taken drugs or something.
125	34 50 69 213 68 8 79 166 58 26 125	Chances are that chair fell off a vehicle that was hauling it.
125	46 8 111 113 100 140 57 167 15 50 125	Never stay within the lines.

125	43 81 12 84 36 123 185 101 132 28 125	Travelling open's the mind of the soul.
125	95 187 71 215 123 199 181 79 50 68 125	These trucks are moving through snow and ice conditions and yet each one is piggy backing the one in front.
125	184 47 145 126 208 156 192 120 79 61 125	This would be a great spot for a pool.
125	107 143 164 36 80 141 88 2 83 91 125	These barrels are lifeless and have no intuition.
125	99 188 127 170 48 173 191 107 11 145 125	So is the projector not turned in.
125	200 24 101 128 188 76 63 38 51 16 125	Shouldn't this be closer to the road?

125	47 165 15 118 104 196 147 188 99 12 125	This place could be anywhere in the world. Globalisation has made it's way into architecture and how buildings look inside
125	182 153 34 100 43 38 139 105 16 29 125	Taken from an objective angle

125	58 81 21 92 128 32 34 72 195 59 125	This guy is a trash fire.
125	39 116 55 121 199 88 3 165 168 152 125	These two look like they are having a rap battle.
125	36 110 58 12 199 71 185 139 114 109 125	That man has a very hopeful and loving expression on his face.
125	191 27 50 154 213 183 132 9 99 160 125	Imagine all the fun you can have at a place like this. Fishing, boating, drinking, good times
125	134 90 212 7 112 202 156 128 210 16 125	The toaster also is a commentary on the way man is chained to processed food and rituals of our days.

125	29 183 56 146 119 151 85 171 207 108 125	I could find me an island to move to.
125	169 166 198 3 200 4 41 15 44 95 125	If I want to run across this snowy sidewalk than let me
125	96 134 101 34 15 20 88 72 123 67 125	I think these trees died a long time ago.
125	14 21 108 207 175 24 63 143 186 26 125	I am not sure if I like those sunglasses on her.
126	181 136 39 170 104 157 73 114 82 171 126	Hiking is a good way to spend a work vacation.
126	140 194 12 115 125 162 137 171 61 119 126	I could make money off of doing stunts like that
126	59 118 49 29 203 180 138 121 127 24 126	Someone has left the light on in that house and is wasting all of the power.
126	70 117 65 149 163 103 75 145 136 31 126	I bet you could sell that!
126	159 215 8 206 10 65 108 194 170 139 126	This man is here to do a job and get to his exfil.
126	42 100 162 137 62 30 85 191 211 139 126	The building facade is not crown owned.
126	178 35 49 100 128 116 43 133 110 9 126	Those children will probably grow up to be successful in business.
126	31 36 156 208 115 86 189 94 214 30 126	I think there could be money to be made on photographing this.
126	82 75 182 116 215 143 138 204 47 81 126	This protest is peaceful and it is accomplishing their goal
126	40 153 127 74 132 171 52 14 134 182 126	This wall needs to be cleaned
126	112 43 118 198 153 29 155 140 81 73 126	Attending seminars is a wonderful way to grow with your company.
126	16 19 144 106 42 133 155 170 47 211 126	It's just a wall.

126	62 148 192 40 69 142 188 13 215 57 126	This is the farm outside of Wellville.
126	25 41 99 151 21 19 67 72 197 27 126	This seems efficient.
126	181 81 151 155 72 140 54 63 58 196 126	I wouldn't hire these two
126	143 10 24 132 209 159 1 179 59 88 126	Opinions through modern art

126	12 163 125 38 69 103 58 65 119 204 126	There is a red bird in the bushes, maybe find out what kind it is and if it benefits us.

126	162 166 118 140 197 92 77 58 123 14 126	I bet the local costume-supply store made a killing that day.
126	23 62 30 80 143 108 118 59 94 65 126	I could promote that group and earn a lot of money.
126	201 174 140 166 19 96 180 16 207 41 126	We could build a hotel here.

126	193 146 132 138 152 172 184 28 5 130 126	This artwork could be used as a sign if it was a little more readable.
126	26 92 42 149 192 122 143 121 142 182 126	Walks on the beach are a nice change up from working 40+ hours a week in a cubicle

126	203 115 23 89 188 17 132 19 209 108 126	I'm assuming this is part of a clock?
126	42 156 144 40 196 192 212 22 172 92 126	These men skating should dress more appropriately
126	37 81 123 5 179 193 86 55 125 124 126	You come model for me, I'll only take 5 percent.
126	53 180 140 21 96 33 186 62 50 188 126	It's very economical to ride your bike to work. Glad they put these parking spaces here so you can do just that!
126	144 202 47 54 161 63 172 187 69 65 126	The child is able to sit up earlier than most children develop this

126	176 86 142 47 31 208 92 206 143 152 126	The child appears to be unhappy
126	100 122 160 55 113 188 114 159 30 105 126	I need to attend one of these seminars.  He is great!
126	63 194 174 163 210 164 213 139 184 1 126	Someone should hire a team to do this work.
126	166 46 74 96 105 92 31 41 161 164 126	Those boulders need to be moved.
126	81 56 99 36 203 195 129 32 78 95 126	That is such a waste of water.
126	194 90 203 140 171 184 27 168 29 137 126	Is this going to make me money?
126	40 138 43 161 42 163 131 190 124 65 126	This tower is cost-effective.
126	179 184 120 3 205 155 18 136 61 190 126	Someone should sell that lamb.
126	15 211 113 14 102 202 160 67 26 92 126	I wonder how much money these trolleys make in the city, maybe I should invest in a trolley company...
126	73 138 214 51 163 15 70 182 142 66 126	We can probably sell this.  People like kid art these days.
126	59 166 153 123 141 185 157 58 117 155 126	This structure is beyond repair - far more advantageous to just demolish it and start over.
126	147 85 29 21 197 110 196 141 145 72 126	This old building could be demolished to make way for a big better mall.
126	162 29 127 129 52 149 71 25 80 135 126	When scouting out new properties to invest in, the crows calculate the garbage can to vehicle traffic ratio.

126	190 170 210 88 176 31 181 155 107 25 126	Spending a wonderful afternoon at the Beach.
126	129 181 161 143 117 183 77 215 34 170 126	I hope those tunnels are to code
126	174 7 13 134 143 48 213 203 83 119 126	They should hire better graphic designers. Having better signs will make things much smoother for them
126	192 16 7 209 135 106 14 15 168 47 126	Looks expensive but sometimes you need it to get the job done
126	17 136 179 117 85 187 119 20 168 177 126	I don't know if you can make any money doing this
126	93 214 106 176 97 146 7 155 166 88 126	His face looking at that cupcake is like a worker looking at his paycheck.
126	77 53 11 35 191 178 161 100 212 21 126	I would be interested in investing in this group of talent.
126	52 104 160 20 93 161 71 65 101 1 126	I can't afford to be a clown for a day, I've got a business to run!

126	9 2 76 188 98 131 7 155 49 44 126	I could use this scenery to calm my mind so that I can think strategically about my next endeavor
126	142 57 198 41 7 39 149 83 128 116 126	It's a sunset. It looks like every other sunset. Not to be rude but.. there's enough pictures of the sky out there.
126	140 17 42 21 90 184 215 116 59 152 126	Buildings like this can attract a lot of people with a lot of money.
126	129 148 91 152 16 181 127 163 4 97 126	Very important to have meetings to share and convey your opinion on a matter
126	55 127 30 118 73 63 78 156 107 68 126	I show up for work every day at my office shown there.
126	92 79 26 166 175 28 6 144 43 20 126	The number of tourists in the area are reaching a maximum.
126	96 50 3 90 156 185 184 148 27 147 126	Such a place must be attracting a lot of tourists and bringing in so much money.
126	202 112 143 13 114 190 151 69 41 172 126	We can frame this and sell it as a Hallmark card... think about it
126	64 171 150 165 180 5 194 28 9 8 126	I'd like to take my clients out on a boat like that! It'd be good for business!
126	87 167 211 76 34 72 108 157 85 89 126	These people must be getting paid a decent amount.
126	155 165 209 137 120 200 78 106 146 124 126	Track can be used for the Olympics to make money.
126	145 198 113 11 106 89 214 169 63 180 126	Children need to grow up and get a job.
126	27 111 163 193 160 43 35 120 113 140 126	It's a magnificent bird but I wonder how much it would sell for should I capture it and put it on the market.
126	12 38 62 16 93 33 155 66 137 21 126	I like how artists express their feelings through art when drawing on such a plain paper,they always think about whom they will sell it to.
126	38 21 66 68 86 46 169 43 200 65 126	I'd purchase this color for my pantry. In fact, I already have.
126	59 90 66 43 76 214 171 186 201 104 126	She is a strong businesswoman.
126	181 19 27 3 98 76 52 194 146 154 126	How can i make money out of selling such like flowers?s
126	100 45 75 151 11 24 139 86 102 158 126	That is not the most efficient use of bricks.
126	155 203 90 154 1 37 52 110 19 137 126	looks like a drilling operation?
126	106 179 114 39 62 80 1 13 110 172 126	it is nice

126	165 179 91 100 140 49 212 123 101 171 126	We can renovate this building.
126	135 157 95 82 114 111 96 166 198 101 126	She has extraordinary playing skills.  I wonder what her background was.

126	154 94 77 156 67 36 53 83 80 160 126	The two women look like they'd make good employees.
126	35 124 129 101 4 109 96 135 214 204 126	I wonder how this would look as the back drop to a business card.
126	149 174 190 116 54 32 178 81 176 162 126	I'd have to schedule well in advance to get approval from corporate to take my son somewhere like this.
126	8 34 119 16 196 100 86 78 132 137 126	Important to schedule time to do the things you need to. Whether it be for faith or family, make the time.

126	21 1 158 56 77 11 79 67 66 188 126	I do believe that whomever did their power point presentation did a very professional job.
126	206 146 42 200 109 34 33 31 191 9 126	This show should bring in a lot of revenue
126	95 192 9 41 155 83 12 116 75 25 126	You could build a lucrative resort here.
126	132 106 105 95 134 108 203 180 211 101 126	Here we have the best service
126	122 32 213 95 123 109 42 112 20 16 126	Could use a bit of an upgrade asthetically
126	83 148 158 143 175 20 137 208 144 154 126	Take whichever is more efficient
126	38 76 145 88 144 56 168 202 2 159 126	Does this really have any use?  We must move on to more important things.
126	86 189 144 6 26 143 153 186 170 209 126	This looks like a good place to throw up a billboard.
126	154 65 196 55 50 88 77 164 145 186 126	This could likely be marketed into a cartoon.
126	77 68 67 192 162 107 117 167 89 4 126	I could probably park a foodtruck here and make bank.
126	2 28 139 142 18 78 188 176 17 163 126	This is a possible venue for our upcoming team building excercise.
126	180 107 206 171 88 178 194 214 183 51 126	What a bad intellectual move.
126	84 78 82 29 92 6 116 93 196 125 126	A red square. How interesting.
127	23 138 201 117 74 214 9 88 12 31 127	Cosplaying is so stupid, they look dumb.
127	77 8 135 94 215 83 195 52 82 85 127	The man on the floor is annoying
127	66 73 173 11 133 164 29 44 13 157 127	Insects are so gross, why are these people looking at them? Dumb.
127	164 145 199 194 68 48 115 207 132 69 127	This line is too long, there are too many people
127	59 115 189 21 214 184 136 91 124 105 127	These screens are so bad for you!
127	206 87 154 213 128 22 149 151 143 44 127	I hate things like this.
127	205 142 5 38 17 198 96 57 71 166 127	The sandwich isn't perfectly cut.  I know this for a fact.
127	70 13 68 143 172 16 89 173 165 205 127	I can't stand people who show off when they are running! Go away!
127	120 15 9 114 47 119 42 167 63 67 127	The water looks really wet!
127	148 106 84 24 140 160 107 201 177 79 127	You see, if you look at the light from the left, you will realize you should look at it differently.  Listen to me, I know.
127	162 83 179 82 80 157 167 75 68 46 127	There is a lot of buildings, I will count them one, two.....
127	183 211 47 73 74 10 129 141 25 41 127	TERRIBLE Horrible music, horrible picture. this concert was so freaking boring and this picture is even worse! Take It DowN!
127	94 54 207 176 56 189 71 48 197 34 127	Refs can be so annoying
127	178 145 6 26 9 182 125 116 48 118 127	Throw Mama from the train, I dare you.
127	207 163 64 183 147 66 128 22 165 28 127	AGAIN?! Y do U post pictures of the WOODS? So STUPID. Take it down down take it down down down take it down
127	16 95 176 177 59 74 28 5 66 211 127	w00T I loooove the 0ld spaghetti fact0ryyyy!!
127	165 12 103 83 102 212 169 193 33 155 127	This is obviously a foul that wasn't called.  I don't know how the refs can be so dense.
127	181 172 21 129 42 68 202 200 47 207 127	This sign is posted every where
127	51 138 112 5 7 49 137 57 152 189 127	Hurry up grandpa!
127	82 46 107 188 185 125 181 62 84 189 127	this isnt even a picture
127	46 188 27 150 107 194 6 112 183 208 127	I really wish this chick would stop talking.
127	18 83 47 208 97 186 65 26 74 213 127	That umbrella is completely unnecessary, its not even raining!
127	16 6 157 72 18 114 41 146 54 109 127	Where are you at?  Are you here?  Where?
127	122 64 112 30 209 121 185 176 54 139 127	That looks so gross
127	212 47 31 16 93 159 83 155 211 24 127	This guy always manages to get inside of every single picture I try to take.
127	35 151 38 210 13 94 52 71 206 104 127	I can't stand it when people try to write in fancy letters.  Why can't you just be normal.
127	99 195 48 5 190 17 194 124 43 193 127	this food is undercooked for me
127	49 66 196 132 180 162 199 93 84 99 127	I hope he burns himself on that fire.
127	49 71 162 203 92 163 15 156 173 54 127	The sun looks so horrible in this area!
127	36 83 85 203 7 46 91 6 42 135 127	I would NEVER pay 10 dollars for that!
127	139 185 119 201 34 84 30 130 54 23 127	This does not look like a very festive party setup.  More work could have been done.
127	129 96 94 208 110 128 85 12 64 133 127	Of course it had to be overcast.
127	62 76 61 71 68 60 29 118 81 64 127	Hurry up and take the picture already!
127	151 89 30 214 111 104 91 191 26 132 127	What is he doing? Disrupting nature like that.
127	103 100 78 170 208 188 39 26 30 175 127	This band is horrendous. His voice is so bad I have to leave.
127	177 26 211 34 1 156 191 18 96 99 127	I dont understand that at all
127	113 37 36 129 180 197 200 24 63 115 127	Those lights are so unncessary
127	104 165 208 59 109 98 108 204 116 58 127	If only people spent as much time being kind as they do creating stairways.
127	177 186 128 187 117 154 183 179 157 87 127	This store takes so long to get your order.  It's like they are busy or something.
127	170 91 8 186 53 159 85 33 121 120 127	Who takes a picture of a moth? That's so dumb.
127	41 125 211 7 133 35 108 212 116 137 127	ugh i cant stand it when people take up all the bench space
127	28 39 155 121 1 134 33 126 54 93 127	Oh, look at me, I wrote a bunch of stuff on a wall. I'm so artistic and cool.
127	174 196 25 167 146 10 8 50 114 2 127	PING! PONG! PING! PONG! PING! PONG! MAN I LOVE THIS GAME
127	3 172 38 170 187 66 154 69 189 191 127	She looks so cold,i wonder what she is reading.
127	161 190 12 205 139 121 63 82 165 145 127	The people sitting look really uncomfortable.
127	2 117 172 211 153 33 59 86 22 190 127	Overpriced garbage food
127	145 195 46 199 110 201 134 11 55 175 127	What a cool boat!
127	45 5 171 186 172 33 111 26 56 59 127	God, why do those dang things have to be so loud!?
127	202 53 196 19 184 204 113 98 150 26 127	Why do people still waste money on these stupid kid's toys?
127	45 137 122 185 111 38 44 109 201 110 127	I hid his wallet underneath all this.
127	108 184 165 111 41 100 173 110 42 68 127	That cycle is much too loud
127	85 129 95 189 160 94 73 38 87 72 127	These women look like they've swallowed lemons.
127	111 9 43 5 146 138 86 19 143 100 127	What is this disgusting thing in the drink?!
127	131 118 125 69 89 175 64 96 100 140 127	Smog over that city is just gross and unacceptable.
127	59 69 77 141 128 142 13 64 178 63 127	A hyena could ambush this chicken and surely have a nice meal.
127	191 87 215 180 100 118 116 25 86 192 127	Old people are sooooo boring. I'd rather poke my eyes out than talk to one of these dudes.
127	123 157 37 181 171 201 33 61 72 58 127	Is this car in a race?
127	208 1 67 181 26 183 136 122 108 103 127	The only way this scene could be worse is if they played the Space Jam soundtrack at high volume.
127	24 155 1 204 121 166 168 8 71 89 127	I hate that picture, that landscape is awefull, really bad, really bad.
127	118 21 67 65 138 117 8 112 96 95 127	I talk and talk until people lose interests.
127	133 33 44 117 32 79 84 162 149 95 127	I'm annoyed that I can't read these foreign languages!
127	82 93 88 213 215 190 122 101 185 182 127	She is dressed like a fool!
127	76 113 78 41 72 178 205 68 9 200 127	Ew get it away!
127	178 23 89 64 14 71 85 58 210 86 127	I hate cats!
127	49 128 148 78 175 67 39 211 19 149 127	Those people are terrible for their actions!
127	13 154 106 82 140 77 189 193 6 94 127	Yeah, I wonder how much money was wasted on this "dream house"!
127	66 96 88 42 89 188 143 165 61 101 127	This may be a functional design for the aircraft, but I find it ugly and disturbing.
127	137 16 79 205 113 38 206 177 144 100 127	Me too! I want to join!
127	102 155 173 168 70 139 39 177 178 205 127	Why would you take a picture from outside of the fence because it ruins the whole scene.
127	75 154 143 164 175 108 25 19 199 28 127	if i cant read it i dont use it....bring me worchestershire
127	43 146 82 76 52 27 142 36 184 65 127	Can we visit this place? Now? Please?! Please?! PLease?!
127	50 197 77 119 61 6 23 89 53 190 127	The sky is blue
127	71 126 197 116 95 2 76 147 54 25 127	Is that an electric meter and a hamburger? Anybody knows how these 2 go together?
127	132 89 159 196 210 59 173 211 66 25 127	Now, someone is asleep on the job. How does a signage get so badly neglected to this point?
127	204 183 47 135 164 99 121 97 34 157 127	This land would look great mined.
127	36 90 114 113 21 54 94 76 103 53 127	What an ugly bunch of weeds. Yuck!
127	195 126 61 10 129 213 102 201 58 181 127	what is so cute about this it is just a stupid fish
127	1 176 77 128 120 105 206 155 66 117 127	All these devices make me feel a bit dizzy.
127	113 110 4 214 71 3 91 202 106 73 127	All those trees are going to fall over and their day will be ruined.
127	137 107 148 3 110 64 157 189 192 213 127	You call that art?!
127	139 203 208 151 181 70 108 135 175 31 127	You don't look like you're having much fun, and why's the picture so dark
127	159 196 137 67 200 194 158 4 145 211 127	No matter what you say, I don't believe this is beautiful. It looks crowded and disjointed to me.
127	91 214 157 34 87 82 54 178 78 10 127	I cannot stand looking at this guy, he's so childish!
127	149 35 109 57 189 142 172 208 171 203 127	When I wanted to photograph nature, I wasn't talking about her backside.
127	115 16 17 68 67 150 8 138 163 174 127	This is an artsy bullcrap picture, so lame.
127	124 63 114 136 17 157 113 19 81 152 127	lifeless street street without life and highly significant
127	109 56 98 41 204 148 65 214 88 74 127	I hate when people stand right in front of you without moving.
127	168 47 131 46 141 8 171 58 121 128 127	I can't stand that noise.
127	195 58 151 80 123 9 162 36 91 50 127	Sit in a chair, girl, you're getting on my last nerve.
127	71 69 213 120 19 13 150 186 78 152 127	I CAN'T STAND TO SIT IN A ROOM FULL OF STUPID PROPLE
127	213 159 59 208 209 25 142 149 190 169 127	This guy has no talent.
127	129 135 157 113 209 11 80 175 195 89 127	Please us a coaster for your glass!
127	204 42 166 65 72 123 173 89 120 90 127	let's do pushups in front of that car.
127	147 165 117 213 140 28 21 83 81 55 127	This art is so convuluted...
127	47 77 49 28 204 53 87 85 144 46 127	I hate this color!
127	19 92 30 24 33 143 205 71 194 209 127	Look at all this sky pollution. Stupid people always ruin everything good about the environment.
127	128 182 183 87 180 108 205 184 113 27 127	These cards are unappealing I hope you aren't thinking of buying them.
127	89 16 41 12 81 196 146 22 26 82 127	An object making
127	30 60 151 48 160 67 74 37 65 88 127	Is it some kind of requirement that smart people have to wear stripes?
127	156 167 173 62 34 187 163 190 201 161 127	Your snowman looks dirty. Clearly you didn't try to hard to make it white. No one wants to eat yellow snow, did you know that?
127	96 45 195 176 198 137 82 144 209 37 127	Ugh, does the ocean HAVE to have waves!!
127	45 29 15 194 160 27 65 130 206 89 127	How dare the sun ruin this picture
127	114 182 106 61 204 27 144 200 187 57 127	Oooh girl, someone should've given her a full size mirror to check out the back of that dress first!
127	144 190 134 171 66 15 23 125 165 27 127	Fedoras + flannel = not classy.
127	200 182 53 140 12 169 145 85 117 1 127	Not sure if this is a home or a bonfire being prepared, either way I don't like it.
127	37 12 94 206 10 56 15 162 77 136 127	I can hear how bad it sounds from here! I play much better.
127	3 34 147 29 85 72 102 164 188 106 127	Those bright lights are really obnoxious and ruin the photo.
127	67 207 153 174 7 134 120 142 10 22 127	This color agitates me and makes me anxious because I can't tell if it's purple or blue.
127	154 36 116 71 57 188 210 21 212 146 127	Someone clean this street for me.
127	81 158 149 132 157 150 40 204 138 67 127	The painting on the glass are so boring
127	62 200 98 133 208 186 101 197 119 32 127	Her look irritates me
127	79 69 148 185 135 45 87 162 116 165 127	I mean the architecture is nice, but its not as nice as my own house.
127	155 17 130 144 137 164 83 158 40 9 127	It's probably really hot over there. Just looking at this makes me want to sweat. Ugh!
127	214 7 52 164 71 83 60 68 87 144 127	These people are pathetic.
127	203 199 102 2 148 100 167 83 108 50 127	She looks like an ugly cow in that dress.
127	71 203 80 169 1 185 138 131 118 11 127	Get off the stage!
127	50 149 172 215 174 212 30 126 191 119 127	skiing is pointless sport.
127	84 134 12 130 25 165 139 98 46 147 127	Everyone leave the room so i can lay down now!
127	76 12 167 178 187 196 180 2 103 84 127	The ancient ruins of a failed culture
127	170 8 199 116 93 207 57 162 106 190 127	Cool car bro, but what's the gas mileage on that prehistoric heap?
127	64 66 198 166 18 48 122 13 191 196 127	This is a dumb picture
127	88 181 205 114 152 100 133 159 214 92 127	I hate the sea, can we go?
127	26 152 2 5 77 82 39 172 173 136 127	Wow, what a beautiful scene. It is so so pretty
127	17 200 192 87 28 212 183 160 75 168 127	GAD that green seating is hideous.

127	1 174 202 22 112 197 85 123 137 204 127	This really annoys me, as soon as he was laid off he should have gone and got another job doing anything and everything. He could have sold off as much of his items as he could and live with the bear minimum until he could get himself back on his feet. Why does he think it's okay to hold a placard begging!
127	100 206 54 46 141 173 162 38 47 113 127	Get your hair out of your face if you want me to take you seriously.

127	106 91 11 137 164 37 69 44 21 40 127	Why do they put numbers on the side of those planes?
127	13 186 170 3 117 203 81 88 67 32 127	No windows and no door knob. Seems little prison like.
127	27 123 96 139 105 167 179 97 125 102 127	The elephants aren't even good at painting. They should give up.

127	70 1 199 116 42 196 37 132 49 201 127	Why are their outfits not matching? It's taking away from the shadows. Man,,,
127	133 198 166 59 110 62 164 92 193 102 127	Ahaha! Sri Lanka, do they even HAVE SCHOOLS THERE?

127	37 150 195 29 108 26 93 104 125 215 127	These grown men look silly in their tight shorts.  They shouldn't leave home dressed like that.
127	58 85 124 53 87 180 6 96 205 214 127	Let's smash that thing
127	184 51 10 150 48 100 183 52 62 117 127	These windows are so drab and dirty.  I would never enjoy being in a place like that.
127	49 118 204 60 42 12 101 145 106 96 127	Would it be wrong to launch a spitball at them?

127	177 40 108 76 33 17 165 77 14 3 127	Modern "art" isn't even art.
127	161 45 69 116 189 75 3 98 72 175 127	Some people in this world are so weird.  I would never go out of my house wearing that outfit, and I would never decorate a bike like that and ride it.  Some people just amaze me and not in a good way.
127	146 37 109 162 211 202 71 10 22 150 127	Why are you still trying to win?

127	206 69 60 23 128 150 57 68 199 170 127	Gross, what a disgusting oil slick of a meal. Some simpleton put in too much grease.
127	113 150 78 168 125 80 79 92 107 159 127	Was this picture taken in a dark room during the civil war? Nobody needs film developed anymore!
128	111 124 50 169 99 109 98 168 108 174 128	This looks delicious, a nice family meal I think!

128	174 124 9 22 11 10 206 210 24 118 128	This was one of my favorite concert experiences.  The  singer is such a nice person.

128	132 48 14 7 143 92 56 207 15 71 128	Folk need to make sure their ferrets aren't eating foil, we need to protect our furry friends.

128	60 210 90 45 108 21 115 189 152 64 128	My hometown is a seaport and there is nothing like the view from the hills overlooking the coast.

128	60 137 166 168 61 4 77 50 118 71 128	A great time of year for the family!
128	52 56 122 168 178 80 191 155 177 44 128	The painting makes me feel so good inside.
128	187 147 86 143 133 169 134 54 56 161 128	The yellow reminds me of sunny days, which are my favorite
128	185 176 60 155 10 157 210 133 105 56 128	I hope they can reuse this space again one day.
128	99 88 59 103 104 108 86 53 161 64 128	What beautiful majestic bird.
128	108 185 160 64 134 194 6 83 16 32 128	I bet he bought that toy for his younger brother.
128	37 158 118 98 174 40 132 192 41 206 128	Great group of kids all bonding :)
128	20 132 145 25 148 169 138 182 163 200 128	That looks like a cruise ship with people taking a deserved vacation. Bon Voyage travelers!
128	79 138 126 182 36 68 30 135 38 11 128	The birds is so lovable.  I just want to keep it safe.
128	171 40 69 175 144 59 97 19 8 187 128	I love to see kids like these learning and having fun.
128	199 45 91 116 126 62 133 171 187 174 128	This couple loves each other very much. You can see it in the body language that she just wants to be close to him.
128	195 197 167 60 174 127 151 23 35 56 128	He looks like a nice boy!
128	167 163 93 184 73 111 48 181 180 80 128	Everyone on that ship needs a hug and glass of tea
128	85 172 154 148 206 158 163 189 146 210 128	I bet he looks back on this day with really great memories.
128	140 46 79 23 34 61 163 71 177 26 128	What a welcoming light.
128	191 52 57 176 196 114 146 90 201 188 128	That's a true American hero. I wish him the best.
128	13 43 32 42 1 118 79 41 29 127 128	That is such an inviting and pleasant environment. I would be flattered to be included!
128	197 192 12 123 2 191 8 145 125 44 128	This phone is the product of people working together for the better.
128	6 94 57 139 154 145 60 180 96 39 128	A lovely evening at the beach
128	17 191 23 18 137 53 182 143 114 32 128	This statue is the smoothest I have ever seen.
128	83 89 114 93 210 123 152 40 88 41 128	I wish I could go spelunking, there's so many magical things inside caves.
128	84 35 138 161 208 77 8 102 86 151 128	Nice looking brick front
128	176 19 186 166 167 147 31 79 91 95 128	A nice place to visit.
129	47 1 162 173 135 22 76 91 168 58 129	This looks like a perfectly dull workplace.
129	173 112 116 135 88 45 69 204 111 51 129	the weather is rigid
129	40 153 194 73 38 144 63 30 131 115 129	Can't say I'd want to go to that underpass.
129	8 90 104 192 165 27 157 176 186 40 129	That truck is far too big.
129	63 119 213 106 133 110 69 209 187 30 129	Bowling is not fun at all.
129	123 149 12 114 162 207 67 57 167 160 129	Why would you take a pic of a wall?
129	24 161 177 72 102 9 37 116 48 30 129	You must walk under the bridge.
129	12 202 48 153 63 19 6 10 166 205 129	That coach is stern with her players.
129	75 2 51 207 184 94 103 132 108 68 129	Why are the cats in the house?
129	137 198 32 25 126 65 8 145 185 78 129	Such magnificent and rigid water falls
129	39 101 209 120 34 175 154 163 210 100 129	She should wear looser clothing.
129	198 36 158 35 73 81 94 2 121 24 129	Just another day at the office
129	12 158 92 79 124 23 78 39 156 52 129	tense, creaky, solid
129	104 125 163 55 85 154 41 198 141 175 129	These men look drunk and disgusting.
129	69 72 83 143 213 120 112 48 84 23 129	That's an acceptable outfit.
129	14 102 88 89 117 196 97 19 113 81 129	Pink flowers are one of the most vibrant found in the wild.
129	69 172 84 39 143 80 194 30 183 88 129	Lovely couple, lovely scenery
129	43 155 164 166 56 152 58 21 17 150 129	Even the buildings on the beach are lined up neatly in a row.
129	27 137 195 131 8 191 186 17 185 148 129	I'd be interested in visiting this location for sightseeing activities. How can I find out more details regarding the logistics of transportation and accessibility.
129	79 115 189 57 183 36 185 98 109 162 129	He doesn't look pleased with what he's picked
129	92 100 37 152 189 167 26 34 52 42 129	It's a bunch of colored yarn.
129	127 51 185 103 83 78 76 100 33 170 129	Looks like an ideal nature vista. Good for a walk, but no extravagant frolicking for me.
129	31 35 67 72 141 37 117 10 162 177 129	I would not want to stand in the hot heat in this uniform.
129	26 117 58 1 122 124 2 96 93 115 129	This movie seems strange, I don't want to watch it
129	140 207 36 28 166 95 101 128 209 108 129	Another concrete jumgle.
129	181 46 62 3 213 161 25 153 17 44 129	I do not understand the purpose of this pose. It lacks logic or definition.
129	61 127 107 90 26 193 3 162 134 185 129	I will never quite understand the use of gargoyles in architecture.
129	154 25 145 167 65 138 40 76 60 50 129	Not as cool irl.
129	149 183 114 72 115 58 170 172 80 169 129	I hope the rail doesn't break.
129	31 61 10 69 127 182 196 212 194 54 129	This is not a good flower
129	41 102 21 5 32 6 49 12 33 193 129	This tower must take long to clean.
129	156 165 6 26 22 52 63 40 116 161 129	This is strange art.
129	3 130 73 44 26 200 82 166 58 96 129	Everything is so symmetrical, nothing is exciting.
129	67 196 107 162 119 64 206 161 180 110 129	They should at least have people in this photograph.
129	210 164 20 34 150 18 28 151 105 44 129	It would please me to dine in this restaurant.
129	85 198 87 9 131 15 44 169 8 171 129	Those two women are awkward.
129	135 210 155 131 38 209 183 19 213 111 129	The people look boring
129	194 81 148 144 98 79 1 8 106 46 129	The glasses are there
129	210 203 191 41 101 84 182 110 43 148 129	The animals are dull
129	48 46 52 211 68 45 144 170 137 1 129	That is a lot of green.
129	82 2 73 33 208 201 108 114 164 182 129	Musicians play their music very loudly.
129	69 94 56 64 39 136 148 175 47 63 129	This seems like a town where pistol duels would occur. A dry town, that I would not like to be in.
129	166 75 102 22 132 98 85 43 134 154 129	Dandelion puffs cause weeds.
129	2 108 53 196 149 131 171 210 141 192 129	The sails are sailing. The water is blue. The sky is murky.
129	156 22 152 168 171 17 117 8 163 79 129	Metal arm cuff perhaps?
129	68 4 125 19 78 53 201 48 24 132 129	Smiling is unnecessary when you're wearing a suit and tie.
129	183 56 7 214 25 109 32 137 121 92 129	No dancing happening here.
129	50 213 77 25 45 79 192 10 9 8 129	THIS IMAGE IS TOURIST PLACE
129	16 187 96 115 147 159 17 28 12 160 129	The grass is green in this picture
129	161 56 12 112 70 11 134 55 204 198 129	This stuff looks really odd.
129	178 122 162 72 105 59 141 64 153 214 129	Am I standing straight enough?
129	50 114 137 74 84 111 153 49 15 8 129	Guess we won't see the view
129	138 142 113 59 114 24 58 139 179 72 129	The humble bumble bee is nothing more than a stumble of genetic misalignment.
129	8 11 126 32 119 200 148 138 211 165 129	Buildings are sturdy, like you have to be to stay alive in this world
129	196 31 215 79 42 13 46 203 49 27 129	don't speed on a boat or you should get a ticket every time.
129	79 179 107 156 86 63 9 127 6 39 129	he isn't going to win
129	12 124 130 91 28 16 203 71 50 205 129	Barkeep! Another round of libations for my companions and I!
129	99 27 145 71 215 32 75 3 79 43 129	Lots of boats
129	192 71 141 49 114 63 109 35 30 131 129	Can these guys be a little more formal?
129	151 28 29 112 106 205 117 215 195 192 129	nice and rocking party
129	159 117 46 49 122 118 138 205 105 70 129	This color relaxes me to sleep.
129	148 115 37 122 15 84 197 113 133 107 129	Please don't lecture me sir.
129	134 202 45 188 198 38 110 162 130 96 129	This car is blocking my way.
129	75 4 107 172 159 118 195 12 42 192 129	Halloween is the devil's holiday
129	69 31 205 204 56 116 87 99 50 7 129	These flowers are out of place!
129	44 93 40 148 122 111 103 154 81 115 129	Elephants are meh.
129	180 16 83 3 29 121 79 202 188 41 129	I will never go here because I do not want to get wet.
129	163 123 207 69 43 54 23 203 81 147 129	group photos look forced
129	136 55 145 120 15 79 34 20 60 16 129	Meh. Just snow. Looks cool I guess.
129	105 180 81 184 110 47 122 85 211 114 129	Graduating isn't that great of an achievement.
129	69 2 51 167 46 121 88 76 43 155 129	That is a nice family.
129	199 9 172 74 134 75 81 18 130 194 129	Kid, you're gonna get wet if you keep going down those steps!
129	134 114 21 196 214 123 93 140 83 195 129	Roller Derby does not interest me.
129	106 158 157 116 142 73 114 168 89 103 129	This is Sol. It is a beer.
129	206 175 93 96 133 20 187 181 48 190 129	I couldnt sit there and take a picture so late at night
129	141 16 39 96 65 112 165 156 132 67 129	He's probably going to fall.
129	28 33 47 154 133 144 105 63 103 35 129	I would not want to work in such glamorous place. Even if they offered me millions
129	58 119 142 161 29 159 100 156 127 114 129	The sky is just a bunch of colors.
129	120 125 96 145 171 212 169 180 164 102 129	Wow. This. Looks. Good.
129	63 103 211 122 213 65 72 39 140 100 129	Mountains are rigid.
129	126 135 15 110 29 23 134 143 104 19 129	Seals are mammals
129	181 174 63 67 114 61 19 194 164 81 129	There's an archway of leaves there
129	146 100 144 103 123 101 194 20 96 90 129	I bet he was asking for the bloody nose.
129	138 139 165 42 82 178 124 109 108 212 129	I would never want to visit here.
129	119 114 155 93 180 142 138 128 141 35 129	A rigid structure is always stable!
129	59 103 142 127 174 8 36 50 200 179 129	That place looks very crowded and uncomfortable.
129	193 178 112 51 102 35 15 124 84 45 129	Could've found another color to paint some roofs.
129	12 18 26 176 150 126 112 207 21 128 129	Red shed, on a hot summer day
129	207 149 194 66 170 140 43 210 198 213 129	I dont see the point of wearing fancy clothes.
129	42 106 182 166 30 51 70 46 73 9 129	I can't tell if it's the photo that's slightly off-balance, or the tower itself. This is going to bother me all day.
129	127 97 91 136 206 48 155 211 73 122 129	This is a stupid montage, I know some software that can do way better.
129	110 155 63 6 14 79 180 145 67 44 129	He is a cold author.
129	193 36 69 157 167 130 95 59 177 178 129	This band is bland.
129	176 161 117 57 186 213 82 42 107 132 129	I hate the jungle, it makes me sweat so.
129	162 123 130 21 175 131 139 20 174 47 129	Where is this?
129	39 160 48 143 52 125 82 159 189 53 129	That water is too murky.
129	157 47 43 139 109 98 208 207 152 165 129	This photo has great composition
129	15 40 140 66 148 159 206 184 98 119 129	Why did you write words on your leg?
129	130 194 94 124 139 33 163 190 142 30 129	Water. Hydrogen and two oxygen. It's nothing impressive, even if the picture is a bit easy on the eyes.
129	156 203 162 101 144 215 198 9 50 154 129	This car is old.
129	71 211 177 53 135 130 77 123 78 42 129	This seems like a really boring event.
129	167 175 181 165 92 112 8 178 29 35 129	That man should put a shirt on
129	170 185 157 92 114 75 117 125 47 145 129	This trip could be uncomfortable.
129	40 92 191 166 109 136 9 85 73 131 129	Oh. Gosh. Tiger. Can't move.
129	119 155 168 109 142 175 32 93 101 146 129	Anime characters are pleasant to look at.
129	36 133 37 158 79 41 5 100 175 54 129	Who would leave this out like this?
129	93 142 75 169 77 74 67 78 84 185 129	Her smile makes me uncomfortable.
129	130 27 67 95 131 63 215 15 40 4 129	He is a bore.
129	141 75 118 123 39 63 191 35 139 133 129	Hockey is a ridiculous sport.
129	151 82 23 190 106 40 177 90 193 162 129	A pointless display.
129	43 60 90 156 189 16 71 40 39 83 129	Just another watch wearing person. I cant see why he still needs a watch this day and age.
129	132 51 3 146 189 101 37 41 52 141 129	I've already planned the day here, I do not wish to change my plans.
129	165 199 200 128 91 158 14 20 150 15 129	I am not impressed.
129	151 33 60 50 3 66 67 166 36 58 129	This looks like a nice dinner.
129	195 148 115 51 175 118 26 172 75 21 129	I swear, you see one monastery, you've seen them all.
129	39 121 101 86 174 112 7 80 132 46 129	I don't think the city has changed much recently
129	209 192 5 143 29 11 167 80 141 67 129	I just hate the crowded streets so much.  Nothing they do helps.
129	139 191 145 98 108 66 81 144 69 9 129	These people are standing around.
129	211 64 54 134 116 209 159 70 197 182 129	the dirt road ruins the house.
129	92 179 190 37 23 124 87 205 1 71 129	Looks way too hard to do.
129	105 58 13 161 202 132 113 177 90 112 129	Cool sign but not for me
129	70 195 97 126 103 12 205 90 68 60 129	I just don't like dancing
129	4 119 126 25 212 179 148 86 61 167 129	The decorations on the wall seem excessive.
129	124 60 76 77 71 89 203 148 99 162 129	Looks old and worn
129	34 30 122 145 171 45 183 5 59 18 129	What a boring wall.
129	158 57 119 92 109 54 75 11 36 186 129	Cultural sites should be protected and people shouldn't be allowed to touch or walk on the location.
129	56 65 84 54 35 204 104 80 168 111 129	Why are those women standing so close to that man?
129	47 152 186 160 50 211 214 203 78 39 129	I am not a fan of the beach.  It's just far too sandy.
129	55 147 215 92 142 8 41 45 26 152 129	I don't think they will be able to do much to change the issue.
129	196 180 155 117 182 77 21 159 113 173 129	That kid seems to be having a good time
129	202 135 99 177 114 118 11 205 155 139 129	The popularity of the gift item
129	6 174 41 172 204 210 58 212 148 178 129	I love that architecture, no matter how much people argued with me about it there's no way I'd change my mind!
129	4 99 144 50 35 170 36 142 57 97 129	Such beautiful architecture, no way there is any cooler style to me.
129	197 210 169 96 80 111 214 154 162 166 129	The lights on the water is all I see.
129	103 35 154 66 19 67 148 165 183 120 129	I love the flag, but not a fan of the yellow cowboy hats.
129	1 175 104 206 16 64 78 155 111 89 129	Someone like me could not get up and do this on stage.
129	127 105 138 103 94 123 210 150 26 54 129	This doesn't seem to be saying anything to me.
129	135 136 157 92 149 154 37 66 158 174 129	A hard hug show the strong bond between the couple!
129	67 98 189 208 62 83 118 52 43 178 129	A sturdy rock this is.
129	182 13 199 63 26 145 153 32 4 22 129	This coast line will have water on it every day.
129	138 28 195 78 35 176 191 166 17 209 129	These girls seem to enjoy the company of this guy.
129	77 41 53 189 5 169 190 126 60 82 129	what an awful mess. if my builders did this , i think id cry
129	17 51 207 134 93 73 32 36 125 69 129	I wish wind does not blow them off,looks pretty good
129	125 148 88 155 68 156 94 71 147 164 129	clever, exciting, fun
129	201 189 38 152 101 50 124 17 202 93 129	Green is blue color
129	42 102 206 30 20 34 78 38 65 150 129	Jacob always seems so happy, but he's done nothing with his life to warrant that.
129	106 83 26 97 43 93 164 65 116 5 129	Whatever will they think of next?
129	77 23 165 13 177 150 119 147 166 102 129	I do not think that is a suitable scarf to be wearing in this instance.
129	87 164 193 189 5 44 144 126 157 95 129	This colour makes me feel awaked.
129	50 210 27 13 88 9 124 141 164 185 129	This is a large city
129	30 208 126 3 20 106 192 206 201 64 129	Looks kind of dirty...
129	22 90 24 139 42 183 153 78 182 185 129	It's pretty stiff
129	192 64 110 45 136 199 176 38 139 164 129	I like seeing green
129	170 49 215 120 71 207 85 193 9 202 129	No one likes round candles
129	87 147 105 66 200 13 180 76 48 159 129	ugh the people around here do not drive well
129	34 50 153 195 192 53 19 191 100 85 129	The petals will soon fall off and make a mess.
129	119 141 58 27 8 174 191 185 114 214 129	If you are afraid of heights this isn't the funnest.
129	18 190 159 7 66 39 208 138 57 195 129	A clearer picture would be helpful.
129	23 171 107 68 47 40 136 114 66 135 129	We need to stay right in the middle of the stream so we don't get stuck.
129	92 154 15 160 132 115 122 25 167 102 129	Do not disturb the guard.
129	196 154 204 14 118 17 75 58 136 146 129	He's trying to smile through the pain.
129	119 20 69 103 80 146 204 153 108 30 129	This is a baby sleeping in bed clothes.
129	186 206 46 45 60 57 81 116 118 101 129	I don't like being called out on it, but yes, that is he after having too much Kashi cereal.
129	185 91 64 37 70 75 59 128 213 62 129	Girls, girls, girls, always showing off their fashion
129	69 61 122 167 98 23 120 160 41 78 129	I don't really know how to dance.
129	11 66 185 121 191 142 126 174 83 199 129	This does not look too special. Anyone could do it.
129	144 38 121 166 212 196 102 211 74 206 129	So greasy and unhealthy
129	124 207 6 168 182 59 26 191 169 58 129	Outdated transportation method
129	153 82 80 186 27 135 193 149 47 3 129	She doesn't look like she's having fun
129	20 175 26 28 72 3 189 186 99 49 129	I guess I should go to bed too
129	101 121 46 155 134 76 55 159 212 143 129	Indoor gardens are not proper.
129	66 26 199 141 12 58 52 37 125 156 129	Bad lighting, weird faces..
129	65 142 30 53 11 81 205 165 61 191 129	come more closure
129	88 80 143 164 187 107 45 196 151 137 129	Too many people in one place - not enough room to move around
129	84 136 81 93 144 44 43 52 119 167 129	That's a tiny drink.
129	29 196 172 5 169 118 106 150 174 68 129	We have some typical architecture here.
129	168 194 169 69 126 15 6 146 60 175 129	Why would anyone have a stuffed bear indoors. I just don't see the point.
129	152 1 2 7 126 131 64 56 182 110 129	I stepped in it and I am not happy.
129	35 213 141 42 95 23 10 26 190 164 129	Their running techniques need some work.
129	111 144 51 77 3 30 191 5 123 35 129	Why are you still playing with legos
129	59 4 105 205 116 210 211 200 23 198 129	DIFFICULT TO GETIN
129	9 127 161 43 96 16 185 120 61 105 129	These guys backs must hurt.
129	174 13 193 179 1 140 100 198 23 63 129	a natural scene
129	49 85 46 61 213 145 191 176 101 182 129	This can't mean anything.
129	50 121 158 154 44 45 30 107 73 69 129	This is just a regular restaurant.
129	90 54 5 55 50 45 208 164 157 74 129	I don't know why this picture was taken.
129	41 197 169 127 158 155 122 59 159 69 129	I like his haircut.
129	150 162 3 203 213 5 38 190 64 74 129	The snow is okay, I suppose. Walking along those trees looks boring.
130	29 9 201 77 72 113 145 99 136 198 130	I bet it is really hot on top of that mountain.
130	47 175 123 212 143 215 30 26 150 10 130	I would hate living so close to other people
130	39 9 75 61 26 10 145 160 211 159 130	This is ugly, why shabby blinds?
130	184 56 71 6 7 202 129 13 88 74 130	What an evil machine, to pollute the earth.
130	2 160 109 63 83 150 56 54 147 151 130	this picture looks a littel miserable on how it was done
130	162 50 24 73 100 99 139 209 151 97 130	I really wish I wasn't looking at this photo, or anything for that matter.
130	146 215 50 125 63 102 155 21 57 89 130	The man looks aweful
130	159 24 104 82 172 39 129 124 150 153 130	The darkness in this city is like the darkness in my own sad life.
130	27 77 134 159 16 62 146 34 138 100 130	Why would I want to go into the park? It will be crappy.
130	4 177 154 40 118 146 9 199 21 173 130	why would they do that!?
130	81 69 109 113 112 153 73 136 171 8 130	They dance together now, but I can't help but think what their divorce will be like.
130	49 72 94 110 185 27 199 16 102 115 130	menial, Inconspicuous, inglorious
130	21 40 77 13 108 64 165 47 46 166 130	Someone wasted their time stacking this.
130	141 98 78 172 190 7 55 122 125 161 130	Most people find joy in places like this but I find joy in nothing now.
130	123 40 36 110 97 90 189 114 166 91 130	the player in the green shirt is suffering from poison ivy
130	114 62 163 81 23 154 148 171 34 109 130	Poor girls looks like she is lost in the woods.
130	10 30 148 89 4 178 207 87 121 66 130	menial, sad, wretched
130	147 4 60 61 138 186 128 203 210 195 130	Well this seems unnecessary, a show of "force".
130	183 151 64 68 163 69 109 134 140 2 130	If only I had the guts to go to the beach by myself.
130	175 206 22 26 67 199 135 19 59 119 130	This lady on the right looks like she's having a horrible time!
130	171 189 127 43 110 70 102 47 106 141 130	I hate seeing people out having fun like this when I'm just stuck in at home by myself.
130	31 107 83 93 119 97 66 207 101 65 130	I seriously hate this bar.
130	92 105 215 192 21 57 39 132 166 66 130	Ugh! I hate shopping!
130	57 11 60 163 198 140 114 178 119 8 130	This car will get towed, I can see it now.
130	145 199 64 49 180 191 194 207 19 101 130	Poor kids, not even a proper bowling alley :(
130	195 100 40 135 144 118 211 30 62 181 130	Parties... What a waste... As if I knew, I just stay cooped up inside all day.
130	76 133 145 210 170 18 123 160 171 213 130	This guy looks to be having some fun, unlike me.
130	144 109 13 105 183 100 116 207 72 141 130	I really dont care about their body language.
130	136 115 116 87 38 7 129 193 93 40 130	I"m sure this remote doesn't work at all.
130	165 46 28 80 51 170 44 195 63 26 130	The flowers help me cope in the worst of times.
130	62 173 135 15 18 145 100 109 90 34 130	He should go eat, people don't know how to take care of kids.
130	120 202 174 113 43 95 65 184 171 62 130	This kid looks like she wants to eat so bad!
130	9 69 208 145 184 190 115 78 211 160 130	I would hate to be here, it looks too hot.
130	123 205 199 147 22 25 86 77 169 85 130	I hate doing pullups, this is one of those places.
130	21 155 104 80 69 44 36 192 50 212 130	He's going to get only a few bucks in tips for all that.
130	11 180 78 164 186 163 59 125 214 153 130	The place is so run down, it would be a crappy night spent there.
130	120 4 110 114 44 147 8 176 181 33 130	There are too many lights and I don't know who could be there.
130	73 152 85 177 97 36 15 94 93 208 130	What boring colors, I wouldn't go here.
130	50 92 54 39 136 66 103 76 74 82 130	Lame motel. looks terrible.
130	71 204 142 112 214 183 132 206 108 18 130	This is how I feel when people call me beautiful
130	162 23 112 165 113 34 62 131 76 31 130	This is the most boring conversation ever.
130	28 167 48 127 175 162 104 150 102 159 130	What a drudge of a remodeling job.
130	204 141 63 134 115 142 102 195 183 109 130	That place looks boring
130	9 98 35 122 132 142 203 155 139 206 130	The canyon is just a such an awful place to be in the summer its just so hot.
130	41 204 71 169 108 199 103 119 173 69 130	and I'm supposed to EAT that?
130	39 14 186 215 82 202 155 171 13 192 130	Oh that looks hot and quite unpleasant.
130	108 169 143 82 9 25 14 159 174 17 130	There is too much food here. I would rather go somewhere where there is better options.
130	87 112 2 208 31 129 26 145 154 25 130	This is dinner tonight?
130	93 134 136 1 137 15 22 132 192 16 130	What a bleak scene
130	36 12 208 53 199 163 117 161 30 58 130	He's not very enthused about dancing I don't think
130	126 107 88 158 202 114 168 21 192 98 130	I hate the way people treat horses now a days
130	91 43 54 24 27 47 176 144 119 68 130	There is no sunshine on the patio, so gloomy.
130	99 208 64 88 90 147 50 210 171 104 130	The dog looks as if it is living in a filthy environment.
130	64 9 156 76 11 192 78 117 113 214 130	A perfect little collage
130	138 197 141 37 6 156 173 62 116 119 130	Great, 6. It's the unlucky number before 7.
130	17 33 174 65 190 78 3 52 96 171 130	In hindsight, I shouldn't have told her I cheated while we were driving through the desert. Now I'm alone, without water or a phone. Oh dear God I'm gonna die.
130	2 200 4 102 210 94 127 109 34 38 130	This cat looks like it is hungry again.
130	23 213 184 71 22 129 29 34 65 125 130	This landscape too will fall victim to human consumption.
130	39 40 214 193 211 112 94 86 118 44 130	She reminds me of my cheating ex-wife.
130	138 95 185 84 66 85 78 105 43 67 130	this was my view all day while waiting on my plane
130	43 181 40 103 125 163 78 195 85 33 130	They are loosing, there is no hope for them to win.
130	100 11 132 115 93 31 67 149 37 140 130	What a terrible way to spend in afternoon.  Hot and in a crowd of people.
130	54 152 66 213 109 194 16 33 186 119 130	Ugh, road trips are the worst.  Boring and tedious and hot.
130	96 204 203 118 7 166 45 205 196 19 130	This balloon reminds me of a nightlight and I cant sleep with a nightlight.
130	110 145 73 2 205 72 101 150 174 19 130	it is a nice garden to see
130	165 42 183 136 3 140 24 202 142 131 130	It looks so hot out there.
130	212 27 84 16 183 161 126 207 3 4 130	Why aren't there more flowers!
130	69 189 114 2 91 72 16 39 109 146 130	These shoes make me want to puke.
130	6 42 55 77 18 11 161 174 182 110 130	A whole building being eaten alive by invasive vines.
130	27 71 101 93 145 65 10 153 207 125 130	This water just makes me think of terrible rain.
130	52 78 204 1 183 170 120 64 169 65 130	The backpack that is nearly as big as he is dwarfs his short, skinny frame. He has to balance on the balls of his feet to prevent the weight from pulling him backward.
130	103 117 61 196 90 199 126 206 150 59 130	I bet it is really hot and humid on that boat.
130	108 7 199 25 15 35 9 135 12 21 130	God, I can not stand this cake or this wedding!
130	73 120 162 188 2 97 5 169 66 14 130	I hate marching bands.  The practicing for hours on end is a real noise nuisance to the neighborhood.
130	32 19 186 145 14 185 25 153 173 182 130	IT looks so hot and everyone is getting sunburnt.
130	78 198 104 211 83 215 175 1 141 81 130	snow may be beautiful but it hurts just to think of it since my fall when i was a kid cold, and even more so cold and wet just cripples me
130	114 2 149 93 29 148 123 89 151 15 130	He was so happy then.
130	132 85 27 105 212 171 139 112 5 24 130	Those light are hurting my eyes i need to look away
130	29 101 147 166 215 28 109 124 157 159 130	The order of ukuleles are never ending.
130	187 165 200 89 2 17 20 47 43 138 130	These girls must want to go home.
130	23 35 76 180 55 62 185 200 78 98 130	Why are these peeople even around each other?
130	74 213 6 86 58 38 133 195 81 61 130	This just makes me sick. I can't even tell what it is.
130	131 188 176 194 112 206 116 25 159 161 130	I love this car...too bad I'll never be able to afford one...
130	95 101 63 194 71 69 62 144 35 199 130	That's gonna be a nightmare to drive in, as if this day could get any worse...
130	154 1 162 99 163 133 3 30 128 107 130	If I have to look at one more tomb!
130	59 73 24 23 81 72 157 7 213 178 130	How am I going to get around this tree? Life doesn't work out for me.
130	19 27 197 99 28 174 51 179 102 113 130	These make me think of my dark mood.
130	181 99 185 182 82 94 88 16 32 166 130	They look like they're having fun. I miss having fun.
130	151 145 15 149 137 202 39 140 213 138 130	I just wish this had been taken from inside the building instead of outside. You can't even see the colors very well!
130	32 91 86 206 28 21 166 93 116 145 130	I hate when my food is touching!
130	20 200 57 162 137 157 51 108 85 5 130	I will never have coffee again.
130	207 194 17 169 21 33 126 110 74 38 130	Boy do I have sun-stroke after today.
130	101 116 68 25 64 211 155 51 36 212 130	Oh how will things ever grow well here?
130	138 174 17 186 126 8 100 98 43 150 130	This noise combined with this many people would surely increase my anxiety.
130	202 87 8 80 74 57 72 212 168 86 130	That church looks lifeless and intimidating with the guards at the door.
130	10 92 157 176 127 174 38 168 183 104 130	Oh my gosh! I cannot drink one more cup of coffee today!!
130	85 12 181 67 6 135 213 140 88 56 130	I am so bored by this lake.
130	162 122 209 147 91 184 207 198 171 39 130	I am so bored of this view.
130	75 31 188 98 23 28 182 68 103 88 130	Cherry tomatoes are tasteless mush from California
130	144 35 33 96 212 7 179 183 76 158 130	I hate this kind of music!
130	74 94 145 30 124 165 156 19 142 191 130	You can see how uninterested he is from his facial expression.
130	178 113 66 128 207 18 47 195 138 38 130	Those plants will make you itch something terrible.
130	152 7 199 187 81 154 129 52 53 60 130	Haaah... this dog looks nice. I guess. A window into a world I will never be a part of.
130	106 145 120 122 64 67 31 143 29 112 130	That poor horse looks like it's not well taken care of.
130	111 3 145 93 172 98 35 105 31 63 130	I wish I could afford such a view. Once again, life didn't choose me as a winner.
130	182 49 212 88 164 15 177 58 187 106 130	Look how far away and small that building looks. I wonder if the train just stops right in front of it and blocks everyone's view.
130	155 80 113 159 122 57 144 91 201 41 130	This guy looks like a bore
130	128 176 196 160 21 133 165 5 115 20 130	It isn't good seeing an unpainted, unfinished sign.
130	74 84 102 37 171 86 51 40 18 126 130	Excellent tastings! That I envy, I also want
130	7 21 40 153 48 142 116 96 1 213 130	If I drove in a race like that I'd just die.
130	66 72 167 123 165 184 42 90 45 4 130	I hate this pig!
130	181 88 92 29 34 30 156 203 25 80 130	This is just saddening.
130	108 203 48 135 32 159 81 155 209 85 130	I don't like that there is no woman in that band
130	34 128 24 146 57 89 182 55 176 215 130	i think is not miserable.they are watching somthing
130	77 16 27 160 156 43 99 176 189 13 130	These need to be arranged properly.
130	210 174 128 63 37 41 125 186 14 144 130	I will never be able to acquire a boat that nice.
130	144 35 85 91 60 149 34 132 117 192 130	Poor dog look like he's not having a good time .ahh i would take him home !!
130	110 172 46 162 214 62 64 160 107 20 130	I hate looking at this. It makes me sick.
130	60 63 207 52 115 50 131 136 80 71 130	One evening at attic
130	138 188 171 140 29 77 26 145 168 8 130	I can't believe these people are actually allowed to run the organization it is awful.
130	20 39 122 81 157 11 191 71 209 101 130	I can't stand seeing nothing but mountains they are such a bore.
130	17 69 176 81 30 93 106 53 20 205 130	People need to get in doors.
130	197 103 203 74 21 80 32 155 144 114 130	I would feel so darn cold up there.
130	157 48 203 94 115 74 17 136 164 139 130	This is such a boring view.
130	8 17 148 19 196 202 155 46 133 30 130	Like hulk, i feel sad inside, im ugly outside
130	114 182 93 30 58 168 34 104 72 112 130	Parasailing looks like it would hurt something awful - the wind blowing debris in your eyes, the rope burning your hands, and of course the sand which is course and irritating.
130	50 61 193 103 98 169 202 85 36 125 130	I hate crowds... I'd feel awful being in the middle of that
130	189 84 87 45 92 58 24 62 69 142 130	Lord knows I cannot stand those godforsaken ducks!
130	139 159 152 90 143 49 23 100 107 37 130	The tree looks damaged... like me
130	71 203 178 108 109 181 122 11 179 151 130	He probably got a statue because he killed a lot of people.
130	74 47 69 116 40 107 121 160 190 127 130	I think it is clear who has the best priorities.
130	63 188 82 5 123 89 196 15 189 64 130	Seeing that makes me want to vomit.
130	120 93 213 56 173 31 133 87 121 55 130	This will be a long boring ride.
130	78 81 61 40 80 89 119 191 39 186 130	I'll never have anything as nice as this.
130	75 47 2 17 117 61 212 22 101 55 130	Is it over yet
130	210 164 213 102 180 33 168 129 198 21 130	I hate people that wear feathers. Why do they wear them, and such an ugly color. Why is it placed on some ugly crossword puzzle too. Could they not think of anything better
130	80 178 102 27 91 180 203 179 162 209 130	Why can't I ever go to a restaurant and no one is there?

130	183 141 51 181 118 185 59 155 123 83 130	This cat looks a thousand times happier than I will EVER be.
130	134 106 154 144 178 33 62 101 146 88 130	What even is this? I should probably know that, I'm so dumb...
130	124 99 59 168 53 11 12 58 152 171 130	I will never go to a place like that.
130	90 191 180 57 183 121 100 72 175 185 130	WHy are we out here in the heat?
130	31 153 61 128 123 60 179 137 215 18 130	Their arms must hurt so bad from rowing!
130	72 155 77 183 71 92 131 166 152 170 130	Pictures of smiling people always make me jealous.
130	121 13 151 38 189 201 202 6 49 91 130	This place looks sad because of that weapon like metal
130	156 39 127 105 17 143 49 126 207 196 130	My life is empty.
130	95 127 58 116 164 102 10 82 61 51 130	why on earth would you want to get invovled with this.

130	184 174 15 9 39 202 175 63 23 170 130	It looks so hot and terrible.
130	145 99 82 164 12 49 170 33 39 48 130	I wish I had a pet cat. I can't so I am depressed.
130	104 132 29 178 182 50 105 24 187 101 130	Lonely and grey, like my whole life.
130	207 160 161 168 29 180 120 51 6 116 130	The lizard does not look as happy as the girl.
130	186 121 80 34 188 191 207 2 167 92 130	Ugh, not another family dinner I can't stand it. Why do I have to see this stuff every day?
130	46 64 170 63 84 6 12 42 20 5 130	This guy's outfit make me sad that I cannot achieve anything in life.

130	181 116 68 20 12 66 23 200 184 198 130	I'd hate to hear that gong.
130	3 108 160 47 40 199 195 184 36 106 130	This jump could have been so perfect.
130	160 24 38 158 133 50 153 195 171 104 130	I thought I would enjoy our trek, but after the questionable breakfast that has upset my stomach, I feel like retching and just want to go home.
130	8 106 23 153 127 166 170 49 96 89 130	Here we go again, more monuments to our government that makes our lives a living Hell
130	171 39 156 155 135 69 119 78 165 42 130	Oh God it's a spider I hate spiders

130	174 71 79 136 57 108 135 42 36 211 130	Augh, it looks like its about to rain, so gross
130	90 123 184 31 73 5 147 10 209 100 130	All those plants and water are probably harboring bugs.
130	186 35 209 61 53 94 154 42 47 136 130	Those chords are just gonna tangle
130	102 16 58 172 215 94 122 131 149 177 130	This just reminds me of how dark and desperate life is
130	143 86 198 16 31 166 5 33 46 93 130	I wish I had a little house. I am homeless.
130	24 10 150 131 123 179 81 36 52 118 130	I would be dying from a run way before I even got the race number on.  She doesn't even seem to enjoy this.
130	62 34 98 9 65 68 212 180 28 18 130	I remember having a garage made out of plywood like that. It was right before my wife divorced me and took the house.
130	8 18 185 78 43 157 62 123 211 77 130	I ride a tram like this to work everyday and also back home and I usually write practice suicide notes.
130	63 30 154 27 118 23 122 134 155 49 130	What a dungeon this is

132	152 21 151 178 53 120 131 43 95 90 132	This pic is so terrible.
132	38 61 196 177 72 154 180 40 90 65 132	I'd love to see all of those structures destroyed.
132	89 29 150 73 189 136 134 113 98 103 132	That baby is going to fall into river
132	37 46 159 143 47 173 145 167 171 67 132	Hope that vase doesn't fall in the tub...
132	213 41 126 175 10 33 133 16 120 140 132	The fashion industry disgusts me.
132	88 81 212 68 69 72 50 156 114 213 132	Her hair is too long, it needs a cut.
132	121 57 2 54 177 52 111 14 172 176 132	That sign wont hold up in a storm, mines well throw it out.
132	79 96 31 209 8 82 14 53 137 107 132	I wish I could blow stuff up like this.
132	164 201 185 34 7 11 17 45 153 155 132	I can't believe they actually are using my old table.  I should go there and break it.
132	85 166 99 131 107 49 168 148 157 62 132	Guy with glasses is going to rip the paper and throw it.
132	131 79 199 207 69 60 9 119 210 134 132	I want to smash these drums up thinking about how loud that room is.
132	3 9 78 210 36 14 2 26 29 110 132	I would love to spray paint those trees.
132	175 136 40 131 144 56 69 211 87 103 132	Let's pull the curtain down.
132	131 103 138 115 198 37 49 43 203 118 132	I want to blast those statues into dust
132	171 95 176 159 178 94 51 128 166 16 132	This place looks like a mess!
132	79 210 72 65 204 61 97 91 145 194 132	He looks like he's about to wreck someone's world with a body slam!
132	107 129 186 89 48 105 202 8 32 171 132	The team looks like they are tire
132	211 214 142 28 109 125 208 170 205 32 132	Some kind of art depicting and explosion and chaos
132	65 189 49 167 51 204 64 43 164 162 132	I am thinking about running full speed into that crouching guy and knock him down on the ground. That would be so funny!
132	116 164 98 197 188 135 144 75 27 160 132	You see a beautiful waterfall. I see dollar signs. Strip mining is the wave of the future, my friend.
132	184 123 127 77 122 8 198 9 136 85 132	I want to set a little fire in this field and watch all that wheat burn to the ground.
132	162 108 161 158 14 202 93 113 26 83 132	If I lean forward, then back real fast, I wonder if the chair will break?
132	53 174 43 193 208 147 116 189 38 91 132	I am going to tear this strawberries cheesecake apart.
132	215 85 209 183 181 174 163 152 25 194 132	I desire to pour black paint all over this artwork.
132	169 15 8 154 184 12 203 159 156 79 132	The audience looks very unenthusiastic.
132	19 83 86 71 203 4 41 31 127 13 132	I would like to smash it.
132	149 183 135 90 145 127 19 30 6 113 132	what an awesome view
132	100 178 8 50 105 11 134 65 51 127 132	I want to bash those people!
132	177 60 143 180 77 4 190 18 172 108 132	The walls are closing in... must... escape!
132	59 141 17 153 78 189 103 181 143 139 132	I would love to pluck out those whiskers.
132	147 113 89 170 9 180 11 108 29 8 132	These are my kind of people! Party on!
132	7 33 81 52 74 151 34 93 79 30 132	I want to smash that microphone!
132	159 174 37 157 44 40 122 201 72 109 132	Might have to chop down those trees.
132	38 178 16 164 71 33 107 197 55 89 132	HULK SMASH historic building!
132	112 180 7 49 127 157 109 19 9 140 132	She better not be criticizing people
132	117 136 54 75 38 55 163 4 57 195 132	Let's take a hammer to it all!
132	65 69 67 51 117 146 162 13 21 112 132	This place smells terrible! I'm gonna burn it to the ground!
132	213 165 130 163 52 120 63 78 183 68 132	I could lit a fire in that room and destroy it all.
132	174 146 134 3 50 103 133 47 105 78 132	That's exactly the way I like to keep my desk.
132	12 176 20 187 213 44 194 88 189 77 132	You guys are losers.
132	186 84 130 193 19 104 39 15 192 81 132	I want to pull that sash off of her!
132	19 183 101 38 32 53 171 66 77 165 132	I want start a fire to melt this snow!
132	9 111 133 89 38 177 187 109 139 183 132	Just imagine how much better this picture would be with a strip mall instead of these flowers - they should be mowed down!
132	171 28 183 99 145 42 59 41 111 121 132	Even though this area is vintage, I'd prefer we tear the whole thing down; after all, nostalgia isn't the same thing as functional.
132	37 131 91 23 44 165 207 78 125 135 132	Heck yes, look at that.  They did some fancy artwork on that wall - think I'll just spray paint over it.
132	1 163 180 7 66 42 205 139 114 57 132	Why don't we just destroy that island, it's useless.
132	187 197 76 137 136 77 9 177 124 68 132	You will no longer get free healthcare old lady.
132	71 130 199 113 110 200 39 187 6 202 132	I want to smash that counter.
132	80 184 183 94 123 100 166 7 186 214 132	The fire they are playing with could easily burn down my enemies house
132	149 1 54 112 102 40 191 27 109 154 132	She is clearly not into you. Move on.
132	206 3 134 38 168 90 47 42 161 71 132	I hope the man drowns in all that water.
132	24 39 19 165 93 188 117 109 166 33 132	nice team work photo and it was taken at just the right time to make it look like the guy in charge is hitting one of the guys
132	207 126 97 174 134 63 159 205 73 55 132	I would come in with a big hit and make him drop the ball.
132	9 90 38 193 142 186 69 73 60 24 132	One explosion in the right place could bring all these buildings to the ground
132	205 184 176 43 152 80 163 35 144 63 132	I want to destroy the place they are at
132	39 51 27 59 144 137 115 201 81 101 132	They are leaving a big mess! There should be more strict littering rules.
132	37 45 18 151 213 126 15 175 83 46 132	I will beat you so hard that you will retire from sports.
132	6 137 99 28 120 86 51 156 62 72 132	That tree is crooked so tear it down.
132	147 93 87 92 131 203 48 103 145 91 132	This city will not exist one day!
132	142 124 119 195 12 148 151 63 32 61 132	Next time I see a green square, I'm gonna throw this computer through the wall.
132	156 113 96 12 84 164 129 120 78 167 132	This happy family will be at each other's throats by the end of the holiday weekend.
132	79 164 138 10 201 1 202 165 134 103 132	You think you've actually accomplished something, winning that?
132	127 98 89 92 93 190 69 116 208 40 132	I would break those drumsticks.
132	172 142 18 110 72 88 40 185 141 114 132	I hope they drop the marshmellows in the fire and they go up in flames
132	169 167 78 115 23 90 48 65 168 207 132	That building would look better as rubble.
132	113 146 30 209 34 76 100 103 168 115 132	Maybe an earthquake will destroy those homes and the land will reclaim this place.
132	80 133 81 215 43 146 17 178 166 114 132	He is the worst rider I have ever seen.
132	138 114 190 98 111 3 173 34 176 146 132	Give me a saw and a hammer and we'll make somthing happen!
132	188 47 37 89 27 82 139 135 10 114 132	I bet the person who rides that bike is a real loser.  No one with any sense of self respect would ride that bike.  I can't believe someone like that would even want to be seen in public.  They should just avoid everyone because they clearly don't belong in society.
132	126 182 63 15 115 170 148 39 11 32 132	Lets set everything on fire!
132	175 197 201 208 34 97 88 156 190 55 132	I would replace that with a nice shop
132	56 70 103 62 180 37 215 17 7 126 132	Who leaves stuff behind like that?
132	135 210 17 36 16 149 161 4 182 211 132	There's a bomb planted there.
132	57 86 152 157 8 12 45 60 168 198 132	I want to graffiti a mustache on her. It would be so funny!
132	28 4 20 177 33 76 113 59 98 22 132	this game is bomb!
132	1 25 127 171 28 49 153 52 140 55 132	I bet I could shoot down that jet if I had an SA-7B.
132	123 159 179 13 38 107 169 1 24 43 132	Those candles are prime for catching everything around them on fire.
132	65 109 127 72 194 140 89 50 96 113 132	I bet it would be really fun to set off some explosives here.
132	166 149 30 211 153 64 106 3 206 124 132	It's so pristinely perfect, I want to take a sledge hammer to it all.
132	43 49 80 98 193 183 51 212 131 143 132	It wouldn't take much to demolish this entire thing to build a housing community.
132	15 52 104 17 189 170 199 62 11 134 132	I would break that.
132	119 162 122 148 65 124 59 200 88 188 132	I hope after the toast they all smash their glasses on the floor! That's the only way to do it.
132	131 171 109 18 124 158 14 44 177 190 132	These seniors tore the trampoline to trick the freshmen.
132	198 140 106 111 87 181 143 101 202 189 132	I want to crush that flower.
132	137 83 77 148 210 15 213 18 208 127 132	Imagine punching out of those windows
132	59 161 37 149 96 118 131 119 105 102 132	I wanna break down the fun.
132	48 62 186 146 51 130 202 152 93 177 132	Is that a meteor coming for that city?
132	107 64 212 9 42 79 122 85 61 150 132	I love these cars due to the fact they are able cause damage with little repair required.
132	83 142 166 143 176 52 111 30 181 10 132	I'll wipe that smirk off his face.
132	17 64 19 134 138 7 133 83 87 63 132	He does not know what he is doing
132	179 120 8 92 108 184 31 135 115 158 132	That is the ugliest advertisement I've ever seen.
132	148 63 128 163 106 102 114 57 7 191 132	I want to destroy their fun time!
132	16 182 61 33 193 146 1 139 42 39 132	I want to shove them to the ground!
132	61 171 190 36 51 32 97 11 133 202 132	Id pop those balloons right now.
132	52 98 177 136 63 53 203 39 22 68 132	Where are the people to destroy these beaches.
132	14 199 214 168 204 18 184 46 48 107 132	Lets just knock it all down.
132	79 18 140 162 86 124 103 60 120 209 132	That thing looks like it will fall apart any time now.
132	156 38 75 24 123 211 48 116 16 186 132	I want to torch this backyard!
132	59 32 27 135 168 67 153 69 157 38 132	That car might explode.
132	203 212 158 206 193 62 14 168 72 73 132	It's true women get money just for looking good.
132	205 40 144 186 51 189 187 124 20 3 132	Be cool to see a fire get those trees
132	182 173 6 55 146 116 144 211 27 5 132	Wish a hail storm would come through that car lot and create some havoc!
132	201 67 85 179 141 157 43 129 207 124 132	The oceans will rise and swallows our coasts soon
132	94 199 171 39 200 126 152 9 74 102 132	I wanna see an earthquake here
132	42 28 182 23 144 69 29 148 6 46 132	I smashed a playground just like this to pieces.
132	106 29 81 3 50 40 37 33 194 75 132	Jesus, who can't even put up a canopy straight? I hope it falls on someone.
132	72 154 108 212 138 88 171 4 49 158 132	This looks like a party that needs to be broken up.
132	102 125 119 11 70 207 49 98 167 16 132	I want to break this deck.
132	79 95 198 109 23 107 210 71 82 148 132	The leaves make a mess
132	184 131 28 211 122 167 93 161 3 206 132	All of this wood would make for a great big roaring fire.
132	14 111 77 127 207 131 51 213 172 126 132	He looks ready to take down the world.
132	109 185 53 100 156 25 107 145 17 13 132	The bug eats the leaf.
132	182 12 21 61 33 41 190 113 123 131 132	I really hate kids.  People should stop having them.
132	123 207 20 206 204 196 134 74 169 115 132	Tasty meat pieces
132	24 188 32 89 16 71 25 15 59 42 132	Buildings like that just need to be burned down to the ground.
132	118 160 129 49 100 46 207 61 192 5 132	Because of human intervention, the river and lakes are polluted.
132	214 126 96 63 27 170 167 93 142 82 132	These glass panes will not last long!
132	98 71 185 175 193 45 50 2 162 208 132	Those tigers could kill each other.
132	117 55 69 49 50 195 20 144 198 105 132	Can you imagine what it'd be like if I car's gas pedal got stuck and it came FLYING through the store?
132	97 20 18 167 140 92 150 104 156 155 132	that colour would be ruinous for my wall
132	44 112 159 125 131 141 51 173 62 4 132	That thing will never fly.
132	50 95 168 140 159 51 49 14 19 116 132	This color of green makes me want to break things. Hulk smash!
132	185 27 43 2 101 25 61 63 118 184 132	He may look cute, but he's like a tornado in every room he enters.
132	123 73 119 211 122 96 131 53 111 87 132	I'd love to wreck this whole barn after what Farmer Mitchell did to my crops.
132	209 102 188 197 69 74 126 115 76 65 132	What a boring scene. Would love to go in and cause merry hell!
132	206 79 72 116 148 91 212 179 54 194 132	I want to stamp on that flower.
132	214 142 73 58 165 201 146 133 5 55 132	He should have a better typing postion.
132	79 203 97 144 182 32 123 47 121 191 132	Blast those statue!
132	35 104 167 58 174 188 51 146 190 103 132	Bad picture with no artistic taste.
132	173 72 197 109 47 213 65 205 164 57 132	dangerous, loud, fun
132	117 95 146 42 122 18 96 120 145 215 132	Lets tear up all those umbrellas.
132	16 205 59 170 120 103 54 206 177 56 132	Just a muscle car doing a number on the environment
132	129 65 79 76 177 50 202 148 57 123 132	I just despise 4th of July fireworks.
132	34 211 69 203 160 183 139 55 178 201 132	These rallies really burn me up and make me want to smack the megaphone out of his mouth.
132	129 72 187 6 201 18 14 210 41 159 132	I bet my dog could tear that apart in less than 2 minutes.
132	4 111 41 24 134 156 55 157 61 208 132	When you are caught doing something you always have to cover your mouth
132	90 2 6 180 178 187 183 48 102 154 132	kids are known for good as well as bad things

132	62 149 102 89 152 26 79 118 43 94 132	I wonder what the radius of the blast would be!
132	136 6 115 109 71 98 53 21 122 213 132	Don't quit your day job.

134	36 116 76 66 148 81 91 121 68 69 134	Parks are known for the green scenery
134	108 176 5 37 103 38 180 93 181 178 134	Wonder why animals were the inspiration here
134	150 189 116 118 95 44 31 181 172 103 134	They're all holding yellow shirts.
134	204 189 194 98 175 55 174 214 140 207 134	Looks like this wall is starting to fall apart
134	128 210 25 7 156 60 77 94 91 80 134	The angle of this picture is nice.
134	63 2 131 112 58 142 135 56 202 51 134	This has a velvety aspect.
134	53 182 200 158 126 208 19 122 7 206 134	I think this car has one too many shades of blue.
134	49 103 68 170 194 182 47 113 115 93 134	The lights are not just for show, but to help night flyers see what is there.
134	112 7 141 184 57 94 63 198 137 12 134	Her uneasy posture signals anxious waiting.
134	73 172 38 93 86 202 126 10 183 37 134	this picture is somewhat perceptive
134	87 155 208 126 37 91 70 30 83 4 134	Window seats are great for pondering.
134	149 213 120 36 99 174 207 48 12 146 134	The lady looks like she is smiling from her soul.
134	94 89 133 198 215 151 112 189 155 99 134	This background is supposed to make you trip

134	153 18 132 206 6 11 100 71 54 68 134	The men are very vigilant
134	53 22 204 143 64 5 108 10 97 124 134	It seems as if those sparklers are almost making words. Also those trees present a potential fire hazard.
134	123 172 21 72 103 10 181 80 208 7 134	This pool is not very big.
134	120 55 51 186 148 11 46 119 135 196 134	There people sitting in room is watching a video on the screen.

134	5 120 47 155 187 139 176 201 56 128 134	What a beautiful tree by what seems the Louvre. That tree must be really old.
134	107 13 49 196 132 78 72 102 79 176 134	Looks like someone has all the right ingredients to make a yummy dessert!
134	56 11 97 59 40 196 150 135 112 184 134	Does A40 merge with B4633?
134	19 186 192 152 23 57 118 76 11 64 134	Really classic silhouette on that guitar.
134	76 141 106 53 159 146 13 62 9 161 134	Can see some of the classic bands in the pictures in the background. would love to jam out in a space like this.
134	146 214 119 128 165 30 137 196 100 115 134	Once guieded ships

134	50 7 79 41 188 130 158 67 70 180 134	Taking a stroll around the city just for fun.
134	155 86 71 100 156 173 48 170 15 139 134	These girls have appeared to just moved into this place of residence as many containers are still on the ground.
134	104 96 56 53 85 17 140 63 125 79 134	What is around her neck in the background?
134	204 144 44 186 166 106 162 28 41 1 134	The canyons beauty lies in years of erosion
134	119 139 180 150 211 208 76 78 94 177 134	I bet these cats love this structure.
134	186 195 142 1 96 17 10 41 47 54 134	They're all trying to reach the goal!
134	149 124 156 112 165 140 198 86 48 99 134	i love this

134	179 79 141 166 207 153 17 151 10 61 134	What an adorable baby duckling. So cute.
134	59 95 38 182 67 114 121 50 175 88 134	The stone engravings are very evocative, gargoyles like this are meant to instill fear.
134	3 168 204 187 62 180 39 135 153 5 134	I bet this was a castle in the 1300's, where they used to torture people and witches lived!
134	62 139 41 208 80 88 10 147 52 119 134	This must be a Burlington city building.
134	207 50 58 191 144 132 156 184 188 47 134	The railings need to be repainted.
134	72 202 141 55 45 22 200 43 58 64 134	Nice edges on the roof, i'd like to live here.

134	81 36 19 6 30 62 173 198 204 46 134	It looks like the woman is not very impressed with the lad's mask...
134	7 45 16 59 99 201 17 135 170 82 134	Notice how this tower has six windows and not five.
134	191 177 59 122 83 84 205 215 208 56 134	The dog in the foreground really adds to the majesty of the landscape.
134	205 146 6 91 188 48 65 195 4 142 134	The tree will break the glass soon.
134	88 114 103 159 76 60 19 144 77 185 134	How close that water bottle is to the edge of the table is bothering me. Hope they didn't spill it.
134	10 46 193 172 123 165 32 133 19 194 134	God makes beautiful creatures.

134	33 207 170 175 150 12 107 143 52 83 134	Hand rearing birds is not as easy as it looks.
134	186 122 102 214 177 88 90 14 3 178 134	Seems like they have a good cause, though I can;t read it
134	47 8 168 109 136 80 155 144 40 76 134	They appear to be playing on a large protective mat for messes.  Thats a good idea.
134	168 165 136 188 90 14 104 151 66 175 134	The congestion of this road makes a great case for the necessity of expanded public transportation in bit cities.
134	82 71 175 207 155 47 174 188 149 93 134	Is yellow coming back in style?
134	4 12 142 185 39 203 21 166 114 19 134	This guy is ready to take a look in his mirror. And he likes what he sees.
134	95 113 96 21 157 112 145 133 179 62 134	Danish fire brigade at rest.

134	15 34 45 188 28 77 211 110 186 42 134	this seems to show a telephone booth going down a waterfall
134	135 56 1 39 121 202 116 11 183 5 134	Looks like a lot of works at the subway.
134	214 6 86 41 148 150 137 156 59 56 134	This must've been taken from an airplane window.
134	167 157 69 159 128 196 48 53 108 136 134	This animal has seen many days.
134	80 211 164 132 193 74 213 138 70 66 134	I think I can read this code.
134	162 203 143 175 181 185 200 210 57 50 134	I see she planted hydrangeas to remind her of her lover, always.
134	207 6 3 94 38 126 143 2 79 65 134	Look how the glass figures reflex in the glass table top.
134	79 212 46 69 164 4 194 82 1 36 134	i am very much concerned with greeneries around me. greeneries give comfort and fresh oxygen , so i would like to sit in open and greener places to do my work
134	17 208 90 161 41 51 206 81 150 125 134	It's not going to rain today.
134	123 214 209 96 46 173 75 2 132 54 134	They started in 1880 according to the sign
134	85 180 115 160 102 70 44 33 130 92 134	I'm guessing that is a security camera?
134	49 129 149 89 64 54 40 48 210 176 134	Not many tickets were sold for this event
134	141 35 66 41 25 153 204 215 214 195 134	What a lovely couple, and by that I mean the one on the left.
134	13 93 114 194 205 57 6 208 141 159 134	beach is what it is
134	210 117 73 158 132 197 13 164 34 196 134	The hiker is struggling to ascend the steep hill because his BMI is over 25.
134	161 100 28 205 67 202 90 184 154 104 134	That snake has a mind of it's own.
134	115 57 132 183 42 128 84 56 47 41 134	The pink and the yellow provide interesting contrasts in an artistic way.
134	159 185 164 140 75 192 108 153 23 92 134	I can only do my best.
134	151 27 79 154 71 75 153 105 198 19 134	The contrast on this picture is perfect.
134	191 6 194 113 67 68 13 182 169 107 134	What an immensely beautiful space
134	149 71 124 175 170 147 43 91 164 20 134	This river was once one foot deep, now it is covering trees.
134	36 199 125 92 90 86 88 47 148 120 134	The way they use the screen to get just the right light would be lost on some casual viewers.
134	146 175 95 31 176 101 138 156 34 18 134	these girls have got it going on
134	31 77 23 120 125 32 169 182 28 144 134	The color scheme here is very fitting. Blue and white gives a very official vibe.
134	21 23 155 203 121 120 103 198 88 19 134	The player is clearly upset with the referee's call
134	58 56 179 96 164 36 147 42 190 153 134	It appears to be a smile, but I can't help but detect a bit of a uncomfortable grimace.
134	187 25 152 14 12 88 46 93 17 76 134	That is a very nice orchestra.\
134	26 128 173 47 167 6 69 158 136 215 134	The cub waits patiently for it's mother.
134	210 66 37 72 6 50 102 88 19 83 134	The new bride prepares for her first dance with her Dad as a married woman. She may have left his name, but she will never leave his heart.
134	149 143 107 35 179 169 3 9 173 96 134	It looks like they've found their favorite author, based off the books in their hands and smiles on their faces.
134	102 61 42 131 35 51 105 210 72 49 134	If you look at it backwards, is even better
134	78 41 124 61 28 163 183 208 11 215 134	In blue lightss enjoying the music
134	10 2 117 133 49 54 122 212 47 40 134	I need to have 7 screens to get this right
134	179 117 188 192 18 198 204 84 200 25 134	If you don't look closely enough, you'd almost think those were fruits.
134	95 168 76 40 51 53 112 88 99 59 134	That's a strong dam.
134	121 166 37 104 100 87 27 58 96 177 134	He looks like a brilliant photographer and smart man.
134	17 89 167 178 131 156 177 36 16 46 134	I think the picture makes him look like he is jumping higher than he is.
134	1 114 128 62 110 108 30 205 71 70 134	I think she's a singer!
134	174 81 89 99 168 108 184 172 110 167 134	I finally understand why it's important to bottle water in glass and not in plastic anymore.
134	176 16 101 12 2 180 108 117 159 47 134	It looks like a beautiful hike that wouldn't be too hard to do
134	164 58 180 77 207 150 167 109 80 192 134	I wonder if they're married or just running mates?
134	199 125 16 110 55 47 119 155 210 118 134	This view of the port town is nostalgic.
134	9 93 87 116 208 77 166 126 79 148 134	This is a well-maintained yard.
134	90 62 17 75 11 7 71 211 193 52 134	This is a car from the 1960's.
134	45 180 88 169 43 195 158 138 77 22 134	The signs on the right are posted higher than the left just like the fence is higher.
134	213 143 168 117 35 208 85 65 101 183 134	She wants to be seen as beautiful and serious
134	41 115 77 6 153 3 120 5 174 59 134	Isobars, perhaps, or just the shadow of a fence? Hmm.
134	208 6 200 123 176 33 95 210 187 107 134	The silver used in this figure is magnetic.
134	119 67 38 47 156 178 97 140 24 27 134	The cat has blue eyes and tanish fur.
134	1 197 82 17 38 144 51 202 116 151 134	Jones Soda is an extremely popular soda in the midwest.
134	105 141 187 85 55 99 30 142 172 150 134	What a beautiful view, the dome peaking just above the tree line.
134	79 25 150 128 213 195 15 144 198 84 134	Choice between salt and pepper or the combination is sensitive insight!
134	200 173 161 42 169 32 66 83 88 15 134	What a sweet family.
134	8 163 137 87 156 57 105 22 191 95 134	The bird has a sharp beak and big eyes.
134	185 105 156 48 116 203 182 67 82 56 134	"The Embassy Trust" is obviously not American
134	181 18 20 105 196 132 112 15 92 42 134	That statue is a good representation of christ
134	178 99 86 133 7 92 21 127 18 204 134	Those houses are facing either east or west.
134	69 167 20 41 46 73 57 194 185 106 134	It is easy to understand why the are sitting outside.
134	56 50 67 26 210 9 96 119 186 92 134	Those are two cool looking fish.
134	38 184 142 19 7 155 164 60 211 186 134	That is a very tall tower.
134	104 214 196 140 11 183 43 48 123 149 134	There is no one on this street.
134	79 211 185 127 213 96 37 29 180 175 134	She needs a toothbrush.
134	170 31 138 5 145 117 27 119 208 92 134	I truly admire the simplicity the Asian culture lives by
134	83 214 32 192 130 89 24 112 194 168 134	Those are fires covered with meat and peas.
134	132 87 43 149 7 97 163 145 201 79 134	Based on the flora, this fountain appears to be located in a tropical or sub tropical country.
134	165 112 156 115 82 136 175 205 114 130 134	The .com on the back of the bus shows how globalisation is in effect. China, a once very poor country is now part of the global culture.
134	27 21 103 78 179 51 161 158 80 142 134	The human brain is capable of greatness if enough effort is being put in place by these people
134	214 54 1 208 50 9 69 205 10 114 134	That mother must be feeling such an overhwelming amount of love.
134	191 171 163 91 13 7 123 156 93 115 134	The man in the blue jacket has been here three days in a row; he must have lost someone recently.
134	83 31 37 45 153 113 48 208 33 180 134	Many chairs but no people.
134	111 142 153 99 123 131 61 110 3 31 134	According to the speaker is very bold and confidant.
134	65 31 188 209 85 121 61 194 79 7 134	The car is covered in art.  Just look at that butterfly!
134	95 34 98 113 83 35 26 206 77 152 134	It appears to be raining in the field.  They are wearing ponchos.
134	42 95 208 172 191 214 184 203 129 206 134	Looks like they're setting up for a cool event.
134	184 70 50 53 172 37 138 43 7 152 134	This is a very unusual grave.
134	165 98 120 53 175 54 171 71 151 198 134	The history this skull has from its past would be a story.
134	138 62 115 54 96 35 193 106 73 107 134	Ever wonder how and why nature creates patterns like this?
134	125 56 130 105 177 195 95 197 52 33 134	Does that measure something for the train?
134	72 136 60 6 127 113 208 67 191 89 134	Looks like a cool model
134	107 190 9 47 53 10 124 182 169 162 134	Interesting.  Looks like one of the fenceposts was replaced with a different type of wood and painted to match.
134	175 35 50 181 97 126 208 147 136 148 134	Somewhere like this is always so hard on the senses. Colorful bright lights and loud music, ahh!
134	25 203 115 158 204 22 125 77 106 91 134	She appears to be working within a lab/
134	26 37 100 193 73 145 81 85 146 50 134	Night is almost over
134	153 67 6 48 40 95 191 207 135 1 134	I noticed the roller coaster in the background is this place a carnival
134	213 119 139 149 163 25 169 154 70 43 134	The intricate detail in these figures is mindblowing.
134	174 139 73 132 17 80 13 195 127 125 134	That place has a stage and a big audience, so it's probably a big concert!
134	119 12 84 148 124 118 185 136 179 184 134	I think that might be cabbage under the fried stuff.
134	196 107 9 3 178 185 113 154 156 132 134	Photography taken with art
134	181 70 20 214 34 106 98 26 56 114 134	This must be awaiting a date for a sweet couple in love.
134	70 121 180 18 34 10 132 158 22 50 134	These stairs will need some cleaning before I attempt to climb them.
134	175 89 100 188 30 190 198 176 121 103 134	With such decorations, it must be Christmas out here.
134	169 84 125 178 24 110 92 7 167 187 134	Somehow there is an unspoken crtesy between pedestrian and vehicle.
134	194 22 147 41 39 90 25 17 125 196 134	This must have been destroyed recently.
134	146 80 131 190 56 84 67 160 177 175 134	This is not a map, this isa glass full of directions.
134	210 53 50 68 21 195 118 57 180 139 134	im glad their shoots have opened. That could of been a lot worse.
134	85 48 206 119 156 97 186 15 158 177 134	When you're at an airport lounge waiting for your connecting flight, it's a good idea to get some sleep and sleeping under the seats is always an option.
134	46 57 34 200 137 186 204 30 146 164 134	The foot prints are one foot apart
134	105 201 19 179 65 30 161 7 75 171 134	I like the thought behind the construction of this building.
134	127 130 45 191 202 184 78 205 79 210 134	I think you can come
134	213 197 112 188 163 139 150 160 68 107 134	The clouds in the background look like its about to storm. This guy should probably land soon.
134	168 161 14 75 106 178 118 65 210 209 134	Those two guys probably worked hard for a long time to buy those cars they are standing by.
134	41 113 30 99 21 179 159 136 157 65 134	This flower has a lot of pollen.
134	118 12 173 13 184 205 33 107 151 193 134	The is a nice looking shot, by an expert player.
134	24 59 15 146 145 157 121 187 174 169 134	The girl is a nine in a lot of Asian states
134	22 184 18 179 183 58 152 75 66 47 134	This is a city skyline up close.
134	137 93 70 2 47 173 124 131 214 149 134	There is so much talent being displayed
134	27 2 113 92 73 94 87 62 63 127 134	Looks like South America
134	33 84 163 70 139 146 157 34 9 188 134	Interesting points and curves.
134	7 113 137 48 41 44 92 171 77 22 134	She saw more with her enhanced vision
134	92 142 99 19 75 209 47 162 72 5 134	This may look like a normal sized crowd but it packed compared to other times of the year
134	52 212 115 121 106 25 116 105 12 126 134	How beneficial...it would really improve the environment.
134	190 54 166 128 186 158 13 57 105 1 134	i see the flag clearly and it means a lot
134	48 93 175 28 124 61 95 211 104 160 134	This sundae might be plant based and dairy free by the looks of it.
134	171 181 90 15 87 214 154 27 200 165 134	That must be pretty hard to do.
134	192 174 201 136 85 24 115 124 194 129 134	She looks like she's saying something.
134	163 70 3 22 206 77 4 178 72 209 134	The blue fence is nice but the lavendar to the right is beautiful.
134	146 46 163 90 137 190 179 192 159 161 134	Uh oh , we know whats next to come.Don't we.
134	5 117 52 2 202 58 193 104 112 192 134	I'm not sure what this means, but I bet it has a powerful message.
134	155 87 135 164 39 179 172 199 127 142 134	View of new office
134	215 27 157 99 169 140 200 193 116 41 134	The color of sky blue.
134	204 119 142 211 192 153 129 3 162 178 134	They need to get their message out, even if it's so hot out that nobody can hear.
134	181 192 125 169 53 42 46 153 162 154 134	The home of these deer seem to have suffered from deforestation
134	11 213 69 58 49 140 88 207 190 154 134	She's writing Obama's name!
134	72 141 137 86 176 29 30 16 129 117 134	There is beauty in light and dark shades of this blue
135	83 82 37 72 25 128 152 74 133 95 135	Dumb bird, I'd want to swat it away.
135	182 67 183 117 54 107 58 141 22 122 135	Yuck! I hate this restaurant.
135	165 127 25 79 143 13 168 83 208 125 135	What an ugly animal!
135	72 112 81 11 69 13 160 93 30 149 135	So many lives lost...All gave some, some gave all.
135	121 13 128 178 100 172 48 61 44 45 135	Her stature needs work.
135	197 168 67 177 52 202 26 64 169 32 135	There is nothing more pleasurable in this world than grabbing someone and scaring them.
135	126 193 172 127 63 202 64 138 188 4 135	This looks like a girl I could fight and win.
135	125 70 129 87 211 109 115 27 131 88 135	I would push her off of me.
135	147 195 7 137 88 199 213 84 136 146 135	She is squeezing that stone way to hard!
135	170 115 143 154 164 38 93 64 129 139 135	Another cold hostile day
135	62 202 166 46 9 210 90 1 28 193 135	Nerds make me angry.
135	201 162 20 199 16 28 50 86 56 170 135	When you post something about RELIGION, bad things happen. TAKE THIS DOWN, it is inappropriate and infringes on my RIGHTS. I told the MODERATOR
135	32 22 145 133 152 95 61 99 172 101 135	Tell him not to hump over so much! The bride is almost hidden!
135	131 54 165 81 150 204 56 115 177 108 135	Gotta have these!
135	195 118 8 45 17 117 130 90 39 207 135	What's the point of a book you can't even read?
135	168 21 65 67 177 20 7 102 18 140 135	If everyone pulled forward ONE more car could fit here.
135	179 153 58 41 101 31 139 168 186 190 135	Crush that snail!
135	37 35 112 190 147 23 156 166 24 212 135	toss the baby
135	203 1 148 68 120 179 79 183 192 143 135	Somebody should really try and fight you guys.
135	54 181 130 58 64 153 37 210 127 5 135	He must be playing rock n roll, where's the mosh?
135	85 5 141 29 180 58 144 199 210 191 135	I hate it when they build houses so close to a ledge
135	138 51 104 102 96 58 21 215 148 9 135	I'd like to angrily hurl melons at passers by from the top floor!
135	115 45 209 93 151 116 208 156 211 105 135	I did not want to pull on the tree because I knew it would fall down, but of course, like always no one wanted to listen to me.
135	192 46 152 88 182 194 167 72 174 213 135	Home, home on the range!
135	150 72 154 45 141 40 120 80 77 93 135	This is the best crab period.
135	105 162 33 82 65 125 27 64 136 212 135	Ugh, how about you use some color next time!!
135	98 191 185 124 138 174 118 36 22 186 135	I need to eat there right now
135	48 150 192 187 185 30 180 49 63 53 135	I effing HATE when shadows mess up my picture.
135	46 86 1 74 19 87 50 122 48 42 135	They should be running, not being lazy!
135	196 173 29 156 106 66 80 211 134 103 135	I can't believe these people went kayaking without me, I thought we were good friends.
135	16 73 195 36 71 43 209 96 65 130 135	I can't believe that went out to the party that late at night, that was really irresponsible of the,
135	145 99 33 26 18 17 9 134 191 62 135	Children these days are flipping gang signs and posing with menacing fish! What is wrong with our youth?
135	137 86 60 126 85 210 88 211 34 209 135	A guy in a brown truck cut me off on the road today.  I really wanted to chase him down and say something.
135	161 214 128 202 138 45 26 116 171 33 135	That girl in the red shirt needs a spanking.
135	54 69 200 173 23 96 100 210 118 27 135	I want to smush that bug
135	92 68 2 16 65 183 159 129 10 102 135	I hope there isn't any alligator's in the water because they will eat those birds.
135	197 162 188 112 210 10 165 208 191 32 135	Rock concerts like this always make me want to punch someone or something.
135	54 62 47 195 8 123 64 180 58 205 135	The man looks boring
135	74 165 91 183 4 84 96 61 199 209 135	Its just not pretty!
135	194 20 25 163 70 170 12 93 91 101 135	This building will fall at our hands.
135	96 45 128 106 90 17 182 69 122 205 135	I would like to street race on these roads, they do not look very busy.
135	128 129 188 115 152 16 15 198 82 120 135	Jump higher than me
135	29 137 128 94 124 21 112 197 162 152 135	I would climb this so hard.
135	75 124 49 4 187 180 78 68 33 100 135	I bet his guy can barely even play the guitar.
135	81 186 198 132 214 2 202 158 123 54 135	the night is for winners
135	165 119 174 8 186 127 200 215 110 107 135	This is a really dumb and dark thing to look at!
135	190 30 99 201 144 167 1 184 214 65 135	The foliage in the front pisses me off
135	122 35 213 137 113 17 128 14 158 172 135	I want to rip the sign off the wall!
135	3 125 18 126 146 142 69 143 26 133 135	Big strong hug get ready
135	142 17 104 92 90 191 149 205 87 88 135	I want to climb fast and furious!
135	178 214 182 212 121 33 171 186 103 111 135	that bridge needs to go!
135	58 47 83 52 11 78 17 98 55 21 135	get that lady out of the picture and tell her to stop touching artifacts!
135	162 68 113 168 97 132 3 19 172 164 135	This overgrown yard is shamful. Someone needs to get to work or I'll call the homeowners association.
135	37 30 205 96 172 87 94 76 118 173 135	I'm so angry that I want to smash these with a hammer!
135	37 5 144 116 185 173 14 38 164 194 135	I'd love to race in the Grand Prix.
135	207 101 113 29 105 16 49 48 2 145 135	i hate that stupid statue
135	19 189 6 9 163 122 136 63 99 11 135	This is so weak
135	146 157 73 29 27 82 139 163 106 10 135	I will buy this figure before anyone else I know.
135	191 124 156 186 119 193 70 172 177 131 135	I would have ran on stage to perform my own songs.
135	165 86 42 98 186 16 201 47 28 129 135	He is a bad boy!
135	116 145 207 77 78 75 60 148 5 172 135	Take the picture already!
135	114 176 74 35 208 67 210 131 86 28 135	That drink looks disgusting. It looks like water that has been contaminated and I think the guy drinking it is going to get sick!
135	116 168 140 136 124 170 113 73 87 62 135	This chart is making me mad!
135	200 117 115 148 127 72 88 120 61 35 135	Who uses porcelain cats to hold notes? lmfao
135	167 70 189 190 150 12 131 40 140 129 135	Santa! get away from ym daughter!
135	17 27 180 155 1 59 5 206 129 64 135	Rich people should not be allowed to have such fancy houses when poor people are homeless.
135	59 51 116 144 90 21 83 92 167 161 135	Why would you even post this? Seriously this looks like a pixelated Google stock image.
135	44 88 120 111 180 128 210 200 55 130 135	There is too much laziness at this airport.
135	137 183 206 127 69 42 100 214 109 9 135	just once i wish they would stop parking their bike by my door
135	13 24 173 53 48 205 201 79 65 200 135	Is someone going to recreate this ship?
135	196 140 130 63 28 142 80 68 32 53 135	I want to hang up the phone on her.
135	109 70 215 166 9 24 39 209 84 159 135	This compound needs a better landscaping.
135	54 213 39 168 178 83 107 66 133 205 135	What a convoluted mixtures of colors. Makes my head spin. Horror!
135	31 114 151 24 131 200 16 51 72 165 135	You girls better take home the win!
135	208 162 106 53 159 124 175 48 71 20 135	This is a great location for some serious mountain climbing.
135	84 117 144 131 102 202 180 66 94 54 135	He needs to get a hustle on!
135	78 209 90 7 152 198 86 145 26 70 135	This girl is too scandalous! Put clothes on!
135	165 2 207 182 68 88 164 106 202 53 135	I will pick that plant and make it my own!
135	110 97 57 62 19 214 160 31 149 99 135	I want to hit you in the face, you look so stupid.
135	22 122 209 151 6 188 192 43 3 182 135	Is this supposed to be artistic? My kid could do better with Play-Doh.
135	168 69 127 67 151 53 161 162 86 179 135	Take that paint off right now!
135	96 83 121 189 100 177 43 88 130 32 135	That kid should get a kick in the shin for that move.
135	86 15 163 177 27 25 207 153 214 69 135	Someone has ripped the pants off that paper doll!
135	95 141 155 20 198 102 43 8 181 13 135	I wish they would just leave!
135	104 87 121 149 123 158 170 23 37 32 135	I want to take that microphone from her hands!
135	53 148 99 103 94 169 199 109 54 30 135	I hope these trains are retired.
135	91 49 122 50 163 121 192 82 35 129 135	DON'T PUT YOUR BOAT ANYWHERE NEAR ME
135	122 86 4 168 35 125 192 147 165 199 135	green apples are expensive
135	148 65 45 150 70 79 95 160 108 62 135	I hate this city, it ruined nature
135	197 191 85 65 143 165 93 117 187 185 135	How about you play with a real shark kid?
135	18 129 171 154 34 77 65 52 12 9 135	That parent better put his little brat back in the stroller if he knows whats good for him.
135	21 19 206 142 14 57 185 198 127 157 135	ARE THOSE WEED PLANTS?
135	172 189 157 80 153 38 19 105 3 151 135	I want to burn that place down.
135	169 3 193 37 71 118 46 40 54 100 135	Come near me and I'll claw your eyes out!!!
135	110 165 80 186 145 73 105 125 14 140 135	QUIT SMOKING OR DIE FROM IT!
135	20 132 22 52 109 195 55 196 145 105 135	That little bird, looks innocent right? But it's actually a horrible pest! Every day I see birds like that out there, flying around, pecking at vegetables, and ruining the local vegetation!
135	147 209 108 121 184 60 158 8 65 78 135	I want to roll down that mountain and see what happens.
135	73 112 99 57 174 85 136 100 24 190 135	I want to smash all those flower pots.
135	43 214 4 164 84 8 88 125 50 101 135	I love the city, there is so much energy there, so much drive and determination around every corner.
135	131 116 175 163 144 213 129 35 73 41 135	Just because you put on fancy glasses, a shiny helmet and a skin tight shirt, it doesn't mean you'll actually SUCCEED at winning any kind of race.
135	65 48 160 212 119 106 207 11 163 62 135	Need to hurry up and find a table!
135	100 2 134 132 151 80 107 45 183 177 135	Happy after a nice sunny day
135	159 125 196 110 79 211 19 150 41 67 135	I want to smash these together!
135	157 139 115 61 214 87 177 40 81 197 135	They look like they're moving so slowly. HURRY UP!
135	177 137 153 1 23 46 38 205 165 132 135	He really needs to stop playing with his food. He is too old for that.
135	141 5 66 25 163 155 115 206 127 152 135	The plane looks like it is going to attack someone on the ground.
135	117 194 125 49 34 143 210 54 79 33 135	That road needs to be straitened now.
135	82 16 208 108 169 206 116 27 58 22 135	Let's go get em!!
135	107 80 134 23 191 177 165 8 25 127 135	There is too much noise going on in there.
135	105 180 126 191 32 66 81 97 174 6 135	This image is very unprofessional and almost puts me to sleep. I feel like I need an hour nap just to recover.
135	94 130 131 178 78 151 51 90 129 211 135	i will destroy this art.
135	51 78 42 212 165 173 202 125 14 68 135	He showed them who is boss.  He's the man.
135	124 173 121 199 159 25 187 34 183 145 135	You are really ugly woman.
135	17 191 178 90 60 16 188 204 70 154 135	This is one of the worst restaurants in town.  I just hate it.
135	177 204 103 123 95 151 82 188 138 182 135	She seems to be upset what are you upset about!
135	45 115 58 55 109 206 170 165 161 203 135	I want to fight that guy!
135	60 6 25 66 16 174 52 97 36 31 135	I have a better Car than that! i dont like the orange!
135	44 113 163 191 146 159 104 63 192 164 135	Great place to have a fight
135	211 35 81 25 134 78 193 200 66 58 135	I could punch this stupid wall down in a second, grrrr!! Who cares about history?
135	113 25 9 45 104 196 89 204 141 144 135	I think he's in the way of the boats. He should move.
135	70 179 74 5 129 168 197 115 44 116 135	You are getting me wet instead.
135	139 187 159 101 151 115 47 58 11 191 135	The openness of the ball would make it easy to steal this one.
135	36 205 70 116 35 148 167 94 110 12 135	can't even greet fans Sean, you not relevant anymore
135	128 136 18 57 204 52 91 200 97 32 135	People really need to come out and fix the giant craters in our yard.
135	123 149 41 103 115 48 39 80 20 179 135	who wants some beers
135	141 57 19 131 150 147 161 67 71 178 135	Okay who wants me
135	109 177 20 210 104 38 111 67 169 30 135	This tree is definitely falling on you
135	64 83 51 29 190 202 166 132 102 41 135	That guy's style is absolutely abysmal.
135	59 15 64 61 112 12 113 119 142 87 135	So many plants and trees. A perfect place to get bit by 1000s of bugs. Such a terrible place. I bet there are thousands of mosquitoes all the time. I hate them.
135	18 105 10 148 21 75 112 146 53 47 135	Picture of beautiful clouds
135	78 4 6 79 65 145 74 40 12 141 135	Pound that gnarly kickslap!
135	81 95 40 89 186 111 190 143 115 11 135	This plant is so ugly, no way I'd let that thing in the same room as me.
135	144 79 165 175 57 178 40 3 211 100 135	Go faster! Go Faster!
135	66 65 18 16 144 109 185 215 94 147 135	I hate these guys, they look like annoying hipsters!
135	193 106 61 179 98 213 84 152 104 26 135	What awful company has chopped down those trees to put in a carpark?!
135	113 56 40 112 63 138 98 171 195 147 135	I'd punch my neighbor if he left his lawn like this.
135	32 16 114 43 108 90 57 83 155 188 135	If I don't get out of this office and onto that beach soon I'm going to kill someone.
135	141 131 214 156 129 34 75 101 204 130 135	That saxophonist has got nothing on my skills, I'd play him out of a job!
135	29 15 7 87 80 22 78 81 9 58 135	Kill the rich.
135	199 116 123 152 90 214 164 194 156 49 135	Red makes me feel ragey.
135	66 67 39 105 94 145 137 123 92 209 135	The view is good, but, does the water have an oder?
135	100 26 172 211 149 159 11 167 182 15 135	This is a poor shot of this landscape. Change your perspective!
135	184 172 54 52 100 144 101 207 121 60 135	I want to cut that tree down!
135	183 51 145 182 126 54 38 214 158 165 135	This guy thinks he's strong?  I'd smash him if I were there.
135	109 167 6 74 136 140 165 202 118 126 135	Let's bring down those balloons!
135	6 125 155 168 195 16 117 4 27 53 135	I hate these guys!
135	20 137 147 26 116 77 199 162 141 41 135	Cop down these tress and and make a parking lot.
135	172 204 102 59 68 185 180 97 101 36 135	WOW! Look at these sky! Ahhh so beautiful!
135	153 77 175 39 178 148 19 4 98 193 135	What happened here?
135	41 152 167 26 181 28 95 15 143 127 135	I don't think that man should be touching that woman.
135	119 28 71 50 171 76 132 13 100 176 135	A shark is on the way to eat you up.
135	77 180 1 143 211 73 78 53 91 70 135	I hope a landslide happens on that mountain!
135	140 144 5 175 121 16 164 116 190 73 135	I'm hungry and I don't care, I'm stealing this!
135	57 46 158 47 124 199 36 24 121 172 135	Art with little clothing is not my favorite!
135	178 131 157 112 33 50 10 91 105 202 135	the tall building is something strange.. i feel asthough it gonna fall at anytime
135	143 175 30 133 7 96 177 157 64 127 135	I wanna kick that tree.
135	43 143 7 137 154 134 89 158 45 193 135	That whole in the clouds is big enough to fly a plane through.

135	152 76 114 211 198 55 140 188 50 178 135	All these people all over the place look annoying and rude.
135	115 13 20 175 149 6 140 47 86 147 135	The boy i bullying the girl, he should be punished.
135	26 170 203 145 7 84 155 187 51 60 135	I'm not too fond of white shirts like this. They aren't the cutest

136	146 28 53 65 66 99 71 118 122 22 136	I really would not want my daughters dressed like that, even as cheerleaders!
136	86 191 155 60 142 153 108 82 102 97 136	This waterfall is like the earth crying, it needs to be held and nourished and taken care od

136	75 30 12 161 146 9 193 5 177 51 136	This poor boy needs a good bath and a nice haircut in order to make him look presentable.
136	205 23 130 74 201 67 190 133 45 199 136	That poor little chicken, I would like to take it home and feed it.
136	65 75 112 111 110 38 99 132 165 90 136	I wish I could feed all of the children in the world.
136	154 13 46 7 43 1 105 111 21 180 136	Your feet will freeze in those shoes!
136	68 182 104 8 173 114 131 54 81 113 136	I hope the people that get in this water wear water shoes and a life vest.
136	23 60 100 169 149 198 90 93 152 128 136	He'd better put that gun away around my children
136	124 13 24 109 164 71 83 88 119 3 136	I would be so proud of my daughter if she created a beautiful work of art such as this.
136	113 18 7 102 122 88 29 80 99 74 136	It is so nice to see a brother and sister bond like this.

136	126 149 53 187 81 133 91 192 121 129 136	He should be careful not to turn to quickly and bump his head!
136	154 14 10 150 184 100 140 179 146 30 136	Covering your mouth when coughing is always polite.

136	37 99 160 86 153 196 32 206 90 51 136	I'm so proud of these kids! Just graduated with a 4.0 GPA
136	38 79 131 159 199 35 206 31 155 146 136	I hope that car doesn't veer off of the road.
136	116 77 163 50 197 46 63 79 13 129 136	So peaceful and calming. Needed a good break.
136	16 25 198 147 213 186 42 109 142 87 136	Ohhhhh, you should know better - that's super unsafe :/
136	55 210 48 166 47 98 72 188 84 116 136	I want these colors for my mother's house
136	64 75 149 4 17 82 194 61 98 92 136	What a beautiful view, must have taken hard work!

136	179 92 3 167 204 95 48 40 36 59 136	This is scary, I wouldn't let my kids watch this.
136	185 33 168 118 105 210 61 7 39 146 136	They grow up so fast!
136	81 146 130 63 2 92 180 4 91 9 136	I arrived an hour before my daughter's flight to make sure I am there when she lands.
136	212 215 113 81 143 8 173 167 88 208 136	I never imagined she would grow up to do this for a living.
136	16 9 113 60 85 78 40 97 15 46 136	I hope my children will see this and want a pair of Converse!

136	2 24 82 208 177 180 49 5 37 206 136	I pains me to see a person be forced onto such a menial job to survive.
136	177 49 68 76 87 80 19 86 137 215 136	Hope they stay safe, have fun!
136	191 204 60 179 133 193 200 108 36 86 136	I love seeing the room all tidy!
136	194 118 32 81 188 58 70 90 29 123 136	This security footage isn't clear enough to protect people.
136	213 145 154 66 90 205 86 138 179 106 136	So many kids, i would love to feed them all.
136	143 3 189 190 102 110 184 74 88 139 136	The flowers sprouted from the branch like newborn fairies. I wanted to cradle them in my fingers.
136	170 148 117 203 60 127 80 94 15 114 136	Oh my too much chocolate will not be very healthy.
136	198 37 88 40 151 66 61 181 90 3 136	He needs to make sure to wash out all of that soap.
136	103 8 135 9 114 65 29 81 138 39 136	this room is too crowded, you all may have to be careful on the way out.
136	149 201 122 164 191 61 27 6 177 2 136	So cute! I would cuddle my little reptile.
136	131 175 48 93 152 205 3 202 161 195 136	They're concentrating so hard! Good for them.
136	52 201 185 118 95 97 124 114 68 6 136	Beautiful day to get the kids outside!
136	88 75 48 27 183 59 5 34 24 172 136	Hope you remembered to pack enough socks!
136	188 102 167 78 193 148 21 50 103 197 136	Honey, make sure to hold my hand while we cross this bridge!  There are a lot of people!
136	101 147 57 109 75 69 5 144 114 119 136	Let me know what you want. I'm paying. And it looks like you need a good meal.
136	44 92 56 204 49 86 214 36 72 67 136	People should keep there kids out of this swamp.
136	125 16 75 93 144 167 26 211 147 103 136	I hope these poor, hard-working boys can do their job safely.
136	209 105 100 56 158 127 148 85 197 58 136	He looks so grown up in his full uniform!
136	91 148 21 24 211 103 12 215 214 69 136	You should always be respectful for art on the wall. Do not touch it!
136	12 215 129 152 173 162 62 125 166 84 136	I hope he's staying hydrated. Those lights can get very hot.
136	127 52 94 3 120 198 173 49 98 130 136	I wish I was there to help them put their shoes on.
136	155 35 183 2 210 163 129 117 160 22 136	This land soothes my child soul.
136	140 78 128 57 82 132 76 119 215 66 136	I hope there is not too much drinking at this party.

136	65 43 17 171 49 190 38 134 112 91 136	I hope they do not get hurt
136	41 141 121 64 160 94 104 167 162 15 136	There is no place like home.
136	104 76 152 211 5 213 191 202 110 102 136	That looks like a lot of house to clean.
136	18 8 92 191 60 79 162 152 49 131 136	Awe I would so care for this little cutie.
136	142 195 49 160 72 28 103 83 125 204 136	The cars don't seem too safe to drive in today's time
136	54 106 53 60 101 1 42 140 39 108 136	Kids are asleep. I can finally enjoy a nice glass of Chardonnay under the quiet moonlight. Peaceful bliss.
136	188 43 28 174 124 198 10 108 84 153 136	I love my babies.

136	41 180 3 26 50 69 161 18 178 119 136	Take care of this guitar gently please.
136	162 167 146 125 183 210 74 73 90 44 136	May not taste good, but it sure is good for your health!
136	82 36 128 147 163 23 154 115 45 87 136	When my kid sweats I like to get it out of him.
136	159 25 41 89 175 22 87 163 145 21 136	I dont know if you should be spending so much time on the internet
136	6 172 56 201 68 5 3 187 72 211 136	A nice blanket for a baby.
136	17 92 24 34 122 40 49 155 113 121 136	Be safe driving at night.
136	92 182 210 55 2 145 56 77 168 179 136	Be careful out there boys!

136	24 121 67 13 124 44 127 212 205 37 136	I raised my sons in a place just like that one.
136	12 141 143 39 132 102 97 175 96 126 136	The horse is starving! open the mask and feed him!
136	129 205 189 115 108 154 157 8 120 162 136	I would make my kids this dinner.
136	153 193 92 123 87 137 186 74 10 126 136	This is mother nature's beauty.
136	103 138 120 33 122 90 61 134 34 179 136	What a wonderful family celebration.
136	197 34 83 176 183 26 48 163 188 25 136	Be careful on that roof.

136	188 47 93 139 184 167 44 126 88 109 136	My kids would love to climb that tree and it a juice pomegranate.
136	106 57 103 211 82 138 97 86 72 162 136	What a cute boy! I hope your parents give you regular baths!
136	126 203 170 49 178 92 206 191 82 132 136	Be careful on that roof.
136	119 16 135 158 84 143 159 90 57 169 136	I hope everyone has the proper protection on, I don't want to see anyone get hurt!
136	70 8 114 12 144 192 15 35 66 149 136	This guy is a mother and the father to this child
136	31 202 154 132 173 84 99 54 109 8 136	Oh my gosh! She's adorable. I may just have to take her home! :D
136	126 168 179 74 93 102 22 31 145 196 136	My mother has helped me to understand my passion by her encouragement at painting!
136	125 159 23 177 157 211 188 104 97 89 136	I hope the person who poses for this statue washed their hair eventually, it doesn't look too nice.
136	172 65 27 123 161 192 99 14 157 119 136	He needs to fix his collar.
136	76 191 47 107 113 122 57 132 78 146 136	You should always eat your vegetables.
136	43 100 68 177 8 119 97 204 50 144 136	What a beautiful building. If it was turned into a home, I could fill it with babies.
136	26 108 171 74 71 62 15 5 160 205 136	That dog should be on a leash to keep it safe.
136	97 44 47 7 158 200 123 135 215 60 136	I love it when a family gets together to celebrate things.

137	93 82 190 97 72 167 16 143 44 61 137	Oh what I wouldn't give to be out on the water.
137	11 80 136 40 103 214 123 65 187 78 137	Floating through life!

137	119 189 139 38 100 54 95 17 41 159 137	Despite being about 50 years old, it probably still works
137	19 212 100 160 175 24 45 167 97 107 137	I remember this actor, he played in a short film in the United States.
137	81 169 76 97 36 87 73 115 210 17 137	Tea, it relaxes the mind and the soul.

137	51 124 59 174 198 170 99 36 179 34 137	I'm not sure what that sign is for, but it probably looks great when it's lit up!
137	79 40 50 19 1 128 133 119 28 148 137	I don't think I have the patience to read all that.
137	167 60 68 178 132 102 186 113 180 4 137	What a wonderful photo!
137	163 69 122 29 83 64 173 167 5 35 137	I don't want to cut my grass, man. It's beautiful and junk.
137	113 150 82 156 189 49 69 29 55 214 137	The circular lights are so peaceful

137	79 127 133 189 158 52 42 143 92 111 137	It's such a pretty flower.
137	175 92 15 115 161 84 194 109 42 208 137	The building was constructed of mostly glass.
137	147 78 188 79 51 101 17 28 199 180 137	The birds like the water
137	166 112 50 28 17 99 54 82 95 85 137	Walking here would be pretty scary.
137	51 65 171 31 158 47 199 156 150 128 137	The couple should benefit greatly from the cash they received.
137	172 53 62 149 189 19 166 56 29 61 137	It really was a great game.  They played extremely well.

137	197 40 36 19 103 196 168 154 126 84 137	I wouldn't mind spending days in this room,  away from everyone.
137	148 166 97 152 129 21 122 90 53 32 137	Those birds would be so fun to feed
137	201 35 38 85 72 144 103 172 97 170 137	The pie at this shop must be cooked daily for it to be hand written.
137	118 210 66 125 166 142 185 201 145 124 137	Looks like a smooth ride downhill.
137	133 118 46 128 55 19 27 190 29 49 137	College Bro, the best das
137	30 109 139 97 179 157 47 200 21 51 137	A nice stroll on a cool day like this would be swell.

137	32 13 116 129 135 50 100 131 185 194 137	Exhibition of beautiful faires
137	44 176 154 72 173 67 157 119 4 182 137	Old timey towns are festive year round. Great for a relaxing vacation.
137	89 34 101 187 192 136 163 188 1 102 137	She looks pretty chill.
137	120 207 82 5 75 198 78 150 123 54 137	Some people get scared looking at a picture like this and imagining being up on that stage in front of thousands of people, but you just gotta stay calm like me.
137	29 17 14 83 45 102 71 79 210 38 137	That seems like a fun way to spend an afternoon!
137	81 116 188 5 140 93 194 48 212 182 137	What a great picture.  I bet all the passengers are having a great time with the view and beautiful weather.
137	145 184 21 22 35 202 208 187 154 51 137	Great day to put the top down and get some wind in my hair!
137	151 149 155 41 175 50 40 30 108 17 137	The bus environment looks very natural
137	14 1 87 17 186 59 90 45 197 11 137	These country music enthusiasts are ready to get down and just have a grand old time.
137	173 180 89 25 179 5 155 83 46 61 137	Kids parties are always a good laugh

137	95 35 171 128 17 175 127 64 122 142 137	That is a chill pond.
137	183 189 49 7 73 78 87 99 89 158 137	That looks like the type of place I could spend all afternoon.
137	47 141 44 86 78 180 94 169 154 80 137	That's a cool perfect turn!
137	146 59 148 118 107 181 70 204 54 72 137	Beauty from nature is such a beautiful gift bestowed upon us!
137	155 127 13 152 24 177 140 103 72 187 137	Having fun and making friends is great!
137	167 76 156 148 78 145 17 200 175 202 137	She is being chill.
137	155 106 5 161 42 105 198 111 71 112 137	Those are big flowers

137	166 129 34 68 152 33 85 144 163 89 137	Amber on a stick probably easier to show.
137	42 195 43 14 157 125 28 66 97 197 137	Yoga on the dock!
137	205 148 200 70 173 118 88 212 97 73 137	Ah makes me think of grass on a summer's day. So relaxing
137	77 107 150 208 125 135 62 60 41 170 137	The statue is such a serene image.

137	192 64 159 15 143 181 100 157 17 21 137	Looks like a paint party
137	142 108 1 111 151 20 163 205 102 8 137	Ah! This little insect like creature seems to very much enjoy perching on these beautiful lavender colored flowers.

137	59 18 23 5 22 1 93 134 115 132 137	I wish I was on the water sailing.
138	121 71 2 52 122 194 214 120 212 17 138	I just love my late fathers watch
138	195 6 85 123 53 17 175 106 46 18 138	I miss this speaker.
138	139 92 177 90 73 180 35 125 36 203 138	That reminds me of an old birds nest
138	133 182 113 76 17 128 101 37 61 134 138	Ah, the color of love and friendship.
138	92 133 119 128 178 166 78 132 143 109 138	Mountains are so beautiful, I love hiking.
138	73 27 120 101 30 137 115 45 6 110 138	Ducks are such great parents.
138	93 133 102 209 13 152 151 35 109 61 138	Reminds me of staring at rainbows as a child
138	181 119 195 140 157 94 22 99 101 89 138	You can see how much they care for each other.

138	93 135 203 143 92 15 26 117 134 23 138	I love being there so much!
138	179 28 21 145 122 45 105 101 36 103 138	I know that young man longs to go back to his country by the way he is looking at the woman
138	175 183 57 96 164 169 45 74 54 203 138	It's been many years since I've walked down this narrow path.
138	39 83 194 182 35 23 155 96 37 172 138	Ahh, an old cathedral. Makes my spirit happy.
138	48 213 128 97 160 137 6 168 63 15 138	A lonely bird on a cliff, so beautiful, yet so alone...
138	160 148 71 82 4 167 44 25 120 157 138	That is a beautiful picture that you can cherish forever

138	136 106 3 161 114 80 104 144 19 214 138	He looks so sad and alone in this picture.
138	205 124 18 158 50 123 53 26 46 165 138	This was the best show.
138	80 48 165 203 196 71 158 86 208 150 138	The picture was taken with meaning
138	162 212 191 59 62 151 137 54 211 19 138	The woman can be emotional
138	155 43 61 106 110 197 196 55 212 95 138	Remember all the laughs we shared at this party? So many good memories!
138	180 109 210 159 17 37 205 183 74 34 138	The Star Trek actor is getting old.
138	64 128 54 70 175 90 140 66 158 49 138	Reminds me of the sunsets I used to watch with my grandparents.
138	92 156 206 161 89 171 137 84 185 66 138	I remember a phone like this at my grandma's house.

138	59 119 153 41 6 183 186 139 140 70 138	They look so happy.
138	9 151 7 191 30 129 97 116 2 133 138	Makes me think of the walks my husband and I used to take in the evenings.
138	66 123 33 183 56 188 32 204 144 118 138	I miss this trail
138	144 141 29 129 7 46 20 22 30 186 138	I hope it lives forever
138	149 94 114 202 181 205 100 150 108 18 138	Two birds just enjoying eachothers company
138	115 154 2 189 190 17 128 123 208 75 138	Pink flowers always remind me of mom.
138	20 29 81 14 71 53 174 79 37 57 138	During my childhood it was difficult to be without electricity!
138	102 121 38 3 34 93 78 119 20 139 138	A setting sun will forever be beautiful.
138	207 137 69 208 74 119 79 195 170 11 138	I remember going there
138	174 176 106 122 49 58 152 170 102 59 138	This woman looks sad and as if she is crying.
138	32 175 38 22 108 121 139 169 9 151 138	He's quite the cosplayer i can say that.
138	39 24 61 182 35 20 51 175 144 101 138	Reminds me of the time I toured London in one of those silly busses. They're ugly, but they're a quality time for families
138	153 72 143 4 106 167 75 190 205 210 138	The fireworks are so romantic. They remind me of my proposal.
138	164 150 214 52 36 44 70 177 79 127 138	The black and white really brings out the beauty in the picture
138	89 177 63 16 116 80 165 182 109 47 138	I remember the good old days before he was in a wheelchair
138	161 166 128 5 125 76 188 183 33 113 138	I remember when I used to live in a big city like this. Those were happy times.
138	161 91 205 79 12 4 140 214 213 64 138	My dad bought this magazine for me before...
138	133 89 20 96 79 171 40 26 179 94 138	I remember them well, and they are the reason I wish I never left the company.
138	8 51 177 72 145 132 23 183 29 186 138	I could climb that
138	45 195 86 36 155 158 192 167 22 149 138	I remember a dear fiend who was into rollerberby.
138	47 28 130 31 23 162 200 27 107 94 138	The growing up of a child is an amazing thing,
138	93 2 164 47 36 15 53 211 183 126 138	I remember when my nephew went through this same ceremony.
138	146 10 107 36 186 150 97 59 81 115 138	Keeping engage at the final goal will make me motivated!
138	111 14 177 197 86 146 63 82 74 5 138	This reminds me of a painting in my childhood bedroom
139	165 200 155 162 121 113 23 79 11 92 139	Those houses look too close to the water. Will they flood?
139	120 183 111 103 62 34 160 124 28 45 139	The only thing a duck is good for is quacking.
139	138 11 14 115 15 64 181 155 113 53 139	Some girls are running around hitting a ball with some weird sticks. It's a sport, I guess?
139	168 182 195 157 178 88 127 89 151 68 139	eh not spectacular
139	69 73 121 211 110 66 76 45 214 172 139	Is this a window?
139	16 118 110 170 28 121 73 190 142 98 139	Baseball is a game that can be played any which way. No skill there!
139	13 59 196 41 131 180 215 110 126 174 139	What a lovely city, where are the peasants?
139	131 11 184 116 39 73 141 194 129 75 139	This is boring.
139	7 69 86 17 23 171 176 13 203 156 139	Why would all these things be cluttered all together right here? It's so messy!
139	76 46 67 195 122 88 128 25 199 162 139	The street seems impty
139	144 131 48 40 182 33 44 120 104 108 139	Beautiful and vast land to explore.
139	78 68 24 82 152 6 133 188 174 161 139	I wonder if the ferry terminal also boards flights.
139	78 108 156 146 95 117 137 158 14 39 139	We're setting things up here.
139	170 101 194 137 39 45 205 47 84 128 139	They should take shots and get drunk.
139	93 30 154 141 8 80 148 28 155 121 139	Yeah, so this was somebody important or something.
139	165 159 77 11 81 127 194 128 202 206 139	That building doesn't look very useful it doesn't have any walls.
139	2 81 124 92 96 128 48 108 6 75 139	saying good by to frineds
139	196 90 127 201 134 113 142 125 84 32 139	this is boring. I don't like play time.
139	18 133 96 77 84 110 59 81 189 79 139	Why no faces?
139	122 48 207 23 108 145 209 191 95 150 139	There are curtains
139	8 32 156 168 163 133 40 99 110 122 139	Just go with your gut and find yourself.
139	106 211 4 44 102 151 182 16 141 123 139	Eww. look at the bug I found.
139	182 17 187 125 36 175 70 38 42 43 139	are those real feathers?
139	32 158 110 85 179 97 103 88 189 27 139	Them daggum plants are blowin' their smoke everywhere these days.
139	196 213 171 176 67 77 133 10 124 191 139	The water is by the boat
139	105 84 209 199 130 77 108 177 145 10 139	There is a girl
139	170 178 132 190 100 49 127 48 90 176 139	That looks like it just might be your 15th birthday.
139	182 103 72 55 171 69 87 202 201 43 139	It's a church that's empty.
139	11 114 84 44 146 125 52 25 194 158 139	My lawnmower wouldn't be able to take this down. I need to rent a bush hog to clean this up.
139	90 155 127 164 13 71 46 11 128 203 139	Why not just use the trees for power lines.
139	196 180 49 190 122 181 116 135 58 9 139	Is that like a fish pond or something
139	136 179 112 42 129 19 66 50 117 80 139	This is a picture of mountains.
139	182 207 138 145 102 137 203 39 68 101 139	What is that anyway?
139	175 55 147 106 88 50 150 28 83 51 139	Who is he taking a picture of?
139	146 134 126 112 125 103 15 26 197 196 139	Does that thing shoot people?
139	166 23 158 17 167 108 165 48 102 96 139	what a preserved object
139	70 204 112 110 89 9 5 117 127 157 139	What kind of dog is that?
139	169 168 95 89 2 184 87 150 201 101 139	dumb girl in tutu
139	110 103 29 142 212 179 186 24 156 181 139	I wish I could learn Chinese so I could read what's on the sign.
139	15 41 84 73 16 117 199 63 211 131 139	Goose are cool, I am sad they cannot fly though
139	142 50 134 127 166 86 186 97 106 67 139	I forget what number comes after this, it's too big to count.
139	183 30 2 21 94 8 44 194 58 9 139	I had no idea pigeons could swim.
139	131 27 123 16 39 78 101 175 45 72 139	Is that house wonky?
139	147 9 52 75 169 197 196 155 110 121 139	I love blue dresses.
139	130 75 69 52 173 50 158 188 160 205 139	i love a good smoke
139	87 205 40 105 180 32 94 20 22 83 139	What is happening?
139	75 5 26 53 206 181 125 61 42 18 139	Wow! I think that looks like my boss! I should send him this picture to see if he agrees!
139	177 90 143 4 58 201 146 36 51 28 139	Why are people dressing up?
139	85 124 74 161 95 7 191 42 190 144 139	I like old buildings and all, but this place looks like it needs to be torn down, lol.
139	89 189 198 39 96 169 29 16 36 32 139	A flower.  I'd rather be asleep.
139	89 82 200 118 78 137 198 191 10 64 139	Tastes like chicken!
139	162 140 73 200 1 69 102 10 207 152 139	Why is this picture in black and white when we are in 2018.
139	34 48 161 156 105 23 160 163 196 103 139	I don't understand what is happening.  What is it?
139	72 168 104 172 117 21 208 102 107 40 139	What a lame photo.
139	92 27 32 84 82 178 114 138 67 57 139	That man is playing the violin.
139	86 151 5 14 37 19 84 143 167 202 139	He needed a better face painting, this excited young fan.
139	154 44 164 72 19 97 189 28 169 115 139	what am I supposed to be looking at. those metal fences have no purpose
139	189 48 20 184 174 215 146 31 188 32 139	I bet he sings pretty bad.
139	145 92 197 105 213 53 205 121 66 12 139	Since when did rocks become a chapel
139	94 40 179 98 25 90 81 142 46 19 139	That's a cool truck.
139	186 166 61 189 106 91 145 169 210 67 139	This field is like so, totally, boring. Who would ever go here
139	83 60 68 13 45 17 115 47 112 165 139	All these notes are so confusing. I don't even know where to begin.
139	39 66 94 214 205 101 174 83 18 187 139	why would you take a picture of just a street...
139	137 52 100 51 23 86 42 214 25 118 139	Background was empty but cool
139	182 99 105 8 43 162 85 29 213 137 139	loll this i$ sum #swag. nic pic
139	82 114 28 74 138 121 31 48 193 73 139	Are those trees?
139	121 2 10 157 155 214 201 188 215 125 139	I guess this site is broken.
139	133 64 47 214 211 2 13 69 65 130 139	I have no idea what this thing is.  What is it?
139	101 52 81 7 105 170 84 8 202 15 139	what is this?
139	39 202 182 101 124 65 9 24 18 95 139	With this technology they'll be no more bad parkers!
139	1 117 203 181 157 199 47 123 171 73 139	These people are just waiting around.
139	209 108 88 191 55 202 97 52 137 193 139	These are like lines.
139	33 211 21 115 35 198 77 91 61 55 139	That's a tree.
139	158 23 169 1 3 18 148 15 49 40 139	Some trees and people.

139	68 13 148 186 135 172 11 40 89 62 139	Its a color.
139	201 7 140 57 160 175 135 125 12 101 139	I cant read
139	157 185 82 12 203 118 55 68 8 167 139	That is a nice park back there...
139	174 134 69 54 118 112 201 183 91 21 139	Are they like in a room or something?
139	138 111 21 166 97 67 140 143 169 73 139	That is like a vehicle.
139	100 81 193 122 30 188 10 162 141 148 139	I just don't understand liking live music.
139	36 132 202 170 31 152 27 196 13 89 139	how much of that can i drink in a minute?
139	143 142 114 174 7 46 213 113 179 182 139	Why are these people so small?
139	60 131 27 109 81 186 62 25 100 101 139	I bet that guy is about to get robbed.
139	25 154 83 129 67 191 54 70 73 117 139	Are they like playing an instrument?
139	110 173 86 172 101 145 89 49 63 2 139	Uhm, those are cool.
139	61 50 170 120 28 119 60 21 156 14 139	kid looks a bit chubby.
139	63 37 186 99 185 146 44 149 61 27 139	The upside down triangle is an ancient relic of the lost arts.
139	175 138 187 4 102 68 76 199 5 11 139	What is that suppose to be?
139	110 108 187 159 44 73 129 215 168 79 139	Why is this big white thing out here?
139	22 167 162 151 52 46 132 184 174 185 139	Is that a girl scout hat ? What do the little medals mean ?
139	24 79 153 193 99 167 176 98 3 144 139	The room looks empty and I don't care about this picture.
139	190 48 166 122 150 134 110 207 88 105 139	What is this for?
139	10 196 179 80 173 136 214 96 166 12 139	Yes.  You guys are not there?
139	202 186 44 3 156 193 130 21 169 160 139	Is that like the city?
139	192 109 213 183 7 57 179 48 131 80 139	Why is this green?
139	143 93 118 153 76 25 207 160 22 215 139	Whoever made that gargoyle need to work on their sculpting skills.
139	89 125 186 158 60 84 109 30 103 132 139	Is that like a painting or something?
139	27 7 49 123 15 110 60 195 175 14 139	That is like a cat or something.
139	29 170 160 40 70 136 181 175 146 86 139	There's some trees.
139	77 174 112 166 154 21 185 61 160 171 139	The stairs lead to nowhere
139	209 104 203 194 23 200 157 124 40 6 139	Is that really the little boys heads?
139	125 108 174 46 167 45 169 155 207 164 139	I don't get why people like old buildings.

139	125 108 143 93 109 197 190 137 210 174 139	he seems to be annoyed or something.
139	184 191 32 172 214 149 31 131 57 80 139	Why is there grass so close to the beach.
139	193 101 141 162 70 207 9 47 205 18 139	Museum? oh ok to see statues... can we go to the movies?
139	185 163 132 39 5 196 79 40 199 145 139	I wonder if she even knows where she is.
139	69 122 9 100 61 18 101 85 133 105 139	He can't jump that high
139	91 92 33 129 59 26 205 153 51 195 139	Those aren't real words it's not english!
139	162 154 115 71 102 61 170 143 7 87 139	Why is that path so small? Is it for dwarfs?
139	104 167 188 49 13 94 169 6 193 91 139	what in the world is this place?
139	206 117 202 20 97 83 205 2 144 31 139	Those are the cutest kittens I've ever seen! They quite larger than usual, I'll say. But, very cute nonetheless.
139	7 215 184 124 189 65 195 63 141 85 139	How stupid could a clam be
139	201 81 19 211 120 21 40 90 12 23 139	Why are his pockets so small??
139	189 115 131 55 17 186 113 197 132 82 139	Mexico is such a festive country.
139	101 166 66 76 55 12 44 48 109 53 139	Oh l thought l was a girl
139	10 197 215 121 196 185 96 195 17 167 139	There isn't even an audience. What is this guy doing?
139	2 91 83 85 101 145 119 109 157 171 139	I think this is a vacant pumpkin.

139	85 101 51 91 144 150 165 129 128 106 139	How is this even interesting?  There isn't even color in this photo.

139	54 195 111 140 202 29 90 163 110 154 139	These old people think they know more than me.
139	93 71 191 24 119 50 5 214 160 124 139	This is a car.
139	82 127 20 125 73 14 202 3 5 67 139	Is this like a golf course?
139	181 123 178 77 119 171 40 38 32 66 139	Is that a orange peel or something?
139	167 131 93 58 156 88 22 206 150 59 139	What am I looking at?
139	39 14 180 118 42 178 34 24 23 154 139	Is like that an empty plate?
139	53 27 151 149 61 202 66 117 181 62 139	Is he like in the mirror?
139	157 91 10 21 8 205 65 105 151 123 139	We just sit a little and eat chips.
139	16 2 107 166 189 85 57 113 190 7 139	Is the water free?
139	47 15 122 210 103 117 32 154 25 6 139	I don't like it there
139	5 170 70 92 41 101 94 127 14 58 139	Those kids don't have indoor plumbing.
139	145 176 149 130 42 214 168 45 115 24 139	What is this? A vegetable?
139	151 39 195 74 198 214 126 22 134 35 139	Wait, I'm supposed to use flash? How?
139	200 148 135 180 106 38 144 207 21 125 139	It is a empty space that needs fixing
139	164 4 120 102 157 6 141 79 148 110 139	It looks like a tornado.
139	18 65 130 77 40 30 15 132 210 91 139	I wonder why my water is red and has an orange in it.
139	205 19 56 46 4 14 210 58 119 23 139	You would need a giant person to fit that chair.
139	130 149 145 68 136 18 87 162 21 147 139	Did someone draw that?
139	34 163 130 40 86 65 165 160 114 205 139	This is the satellite view of a coastal city
139	87 9 66 94 29 6 208 195 3 71 139	Looks like another day, just like any other day
139	2 128 155 98 189 38 174 121 115 119 139	They must be celebrating ther 50th anniversary.
139	174 200 132 127 172 6 14 151 58 192 139	Do boats float in dirty water?
139	94 8 40 177 192 114 100 42 5 208 139	This group of people are standing by a pool.
139	154 169 145 110 164 203 174 159 57 163 139	I don't know if she wanted to be photographerd
139	157 75 134 6 37 54 212 165 211 213 139	Red jackets are sure something nowadays.
139	87 55 54 184 133 49 34 3 71 154 139	It's burning up.
139	197 121 141 99 148 102 61 64 52 205 139	Is he opening a birthday present?
139	88 27 36 186 196 46 12 176 41 5 139	Here you go baby, sit on Santa's lap.
139	180 212 157 14 204 7 188 70 206 34 139	where to put these flowers
139	209 125 54 101 110 84 41 81 194 145 139	dont like this picture
139	166 83 168 115 81 50 10 200 212 176 139	This theater is probably going to go under.
139	37 53 191 170 47 146 179 29 164 62 139	not sure i like the what is air conditioning empty
139	11 4 63 5 92 129 167 110 195 185 139	Why do they have so much stuff on their counter?
139	160 53 104 197 45 208 182 189 171 119 139	He is so hot, what is with that stupid tie tho?
139	130 69 25 209 204 48 199 71 186 113 139	That guy is in good shape.
139	125 175 122 36 105 180 193 187 157 135 139	Why do they have those decorations up?
139	135 129 113 144 47 63 197 53 112 202 139	The sun is setting on the wrong side.
139	41 25 42 32 6 144 155 60 104 160 139	I like debbie cakes too
139	81 37 198 138 84 10 36 93 101 54 139	Thats a camera
139	109 205 158 14 24 128 160 113 80 105 139	Friends enjoying drinks together
139	125 35 24 22 131 104 18 91 145 153 139	What a big clock.
139	53 106 72 152 205 170 61 210 178 35 139	This NASCAR race is cool.
139	41 67 90 4 54 166 212 76 34 214 139	Are those goats riding in that cold air balloon?
139	206 190 166 93 204 211 170 15 201 113 139	Why is that baby so small?
139	7 100 209 141 22 33 126 20 121 52 139	That photo is really bad.
139	10 104 144 59 110 15 148 37 87 20 139	That's a weird photo.
139	56 215 114 111 118 164 29 99 102 179 139	The grass is green.
139	210 25 36 33 79 188 182 162 124 78 139	Um what are they doing? Cheerleading?
139	7 175 78 76 91 97 111 138 158 65 139	What is that?
139	107 125 84 5 205 194 49 200 144 122 139	This concert is quite dumb
139	79 203 147 2 167 44 18 190 121 138 139	is that it?
139	46 167 51 47 130 121 52 125 5 173 139	What's the point?
139	152 158 135 110 94 90 198 138 214 71 139	What's the point of walking?
139	118 130 156 114 200 12 126 141 166 58 139	look like a fountain
139	210 201 144 7 80 205 191 136 28 138 139	She is like a emo fairy.
139	32 60 91 113 11 186 37 42 212 118 139	Good one calm
139	202 97 161 66 141 34 132 82 96 39 139	Um, this girl looks ok, I guess. Her dress is really green and uh, silky... The door behind her is cool I guess.
139	134 187 189 147 128 81 114 17 72 31 139	So does this lady think she is a ghost?
139	205 5 142 117 143 156 66 98 122 123 139	Bunch of stupid dudes.
139	171 78 211 101 36 201 140 193 118 45 139	green is a dopey color
140	137 25 107 122 27 80 85 209 11 171 140	What a nice structure.
140	44 54 203 208 107 129 109 210 177 163 140	All are welcome
140	104 61 185 47 108 58 143 131 48 81 140	I would be very submissive by these trees
140	187 146 65 35 130 58 49 122 158 126 140	These look quiet.
140	116 90 189 40 33 93 89 213 23 61 140	Looks like their bike broke down, oh well. I should help but I won’t.
140	123 114 35 204 189 71 193 108 89 52 140	There must not be a leader of the group. They must all be wanting the same thing.
140	120 150 86 162 136 114 41 28 102 9 140	curious, engaging, focused
140	71 17 56 13 185 53 162 170 210 158 140	I can't tell what this material is.
140	171 168 13 27 6 162 201 202 32 89 140	Quite the get together.
140	5 36 174 185 177 144 96 192 119 63 140	There is water. There is sand.
140	164 91 160 123 18 10 72 192 24 99 140	That looks good.
140	143 182 188 96 154 151 92 89 29 172 140	A goat is not something you see everyday!
140	52 194 18 119 121 56 184 113 42 22 140	Lovely street view.
140	62 8 1 121 92 16 59 69 149 56 140	time is gold
140	18 152 31 119 80 147 189 121 164 15 140	I know he is speeding but it's ok.
140	191 85 210 34 6 211 192 208 7 107 140	Time seems to just pass by in this place
140	10 132 22 166 112 28 133 9 80 141 140	apathetic, static, indifferent
140	16 176 43 170 60 17 192 64 159 61 140	This is a nice color
140	184 172 207 175 105 166 41 106 77 100 140	A place to be non-active
140	29 109 149 86 130 44 3 204 67 70 140	Watching the train go by.
140	186 7 79 21 63 33 141 100 93 163 140	Nothing too crazy happening here
140	30 171 165 112 127 200 47 75 150 194 140	I have no opinion on this design. I'm sure whatever the artist thinks is best! Otherwise, just leave it to the fates!
140	193 141 60 61 162 35 109 30 175 199 140	I just want to watch those clouds.
140	78 182 76 144 154 61 92 83 15 105 140	What an unexciting color.
140	66 96 208 18 132 176 113 213 168 89 140	The ocean sunset that day.
140	205 211 24 122 172 143 196 56 67 94 140	Just chill and enjoy the day.
140	62 113 129 149 106 39 157 201 185 130 140	I'm just going to sit here and watch this flower.
140	32 168 153 100 28 50 123 136 9 178 140	The people look very submissive
140	11 59 57 88 34 96 215 165 42 86 140	Off into the wilderness this path takes you!
140	141 47 185 107 58 89 50 127 113 152 140	I'll do what both of you want to do
140	65 198 109 14 40 92 79 8 11 125 140	Tired of these birds
140	151 84 85 119 112 96 160 133 192 123 140	We didn't really feel like going out to clean the ski lifts
140	107 108 60 8 194 6 75 161 35 53 140	I like the innocence of children.
140	155 82 46 100 71 83 63 163 125 33 140	This place is probably abandoned, I would leave.
140	69 145 150 97 19 38 6 4 80 139 140	They're going back and forth to class.
140	23 154 211 56 205 7 130 94 161 40 140	I guess they look great if everyone thinks so.
140	139 24 59 131 108 72 170 148 23 90 140	This place looks okay.
140	144 62 153 110 74 64 94 122 60 202 140	These flowers are okay, I have seen better.
140	36 148 209 89 183 57 175 16 31 24 140	A mountain, one of Earth's many formations. Some like climbing these on occasion.
140	114 71 76 110 11 157 22 175 204 86 140	So adorable, the dog.
140	33 129 128 6 44 184 132 97 144 21 140	How adorable, a small child.
140	197 128 193 166 66 144 83 88 148 191 140	So many milk bottles here, wow.
140	159 171 47 66 118 130 58 9 37 161 140	need power to work
140	64 215 28 90 190 160 32 213 86 206 140	They all look so unexcited.
140	150 148 145 53 124 55 165 24 23 56 140	lighting a sparkler because its what expected.
140	62 32 180 86 166 37 139 199 80 49 140	I would never insult these two.
140	95 121 84 174 1 199 173 187 72 45 140	This color reminds me of my last truck.
140	180 122 137 144 142 30 41 43 155 49 140	I love a good camp out in the woods.
140	184 171 131 212 187 31 84 48 42 90 140	Ok, so there are 2 statues lying on the ground, and.........?
140	131 87 29 36 99 108 71 63 197 27 140	Don't look at me with those sad puppy eyes.
140	95 10 126 200 198 142 66 130 212 108 140	Five bucks is a nice price, but if it is that cheap, how important is the event really?
140	61 64 139 91 107 82 45 112 51 7 140	Some people are sitting around
140	130 144 123 46 31 104 182 83 87 161 140	I don't think this picture is too good.
140	39 48 196 108 107 42 4 188 171 102 140	I guess it's exciting that they won.
140	34 8 123 105 23 81 174 145 214 12 140	I guess they are happy about something.
140	208 121 51 85 180 1 89 68 33 202 140	nice family photo
140	132 109 66 195 207 202 79 206 33 92 140	This seat looks far from the stage.
140	13 58 131 151 84 143 6 60 103 39 140	I oftentimes feel just like that sculpted bird.
140	185 129 64 18 146 168 213 4 199 74 140	Very nice.
140	78 91 7 86 173 20 147 27 125 184 140	She is a better athlete than me
140	163 45 105 148 189 28 158 79 71 185 140	I wonder if the storm will pass by?
140	63 81 77 132 178 183 168 38 118 75 140	Nothing special to see here.
140	167 138 154 135 66 84 145 210 96 95 140	I'd rather not say.
140	38 212 138 51 197 185 161 195 117 122 140	it might be a wall but i dont care
140	160 165 154 21 143 105 174 10 202 159 140	she really shouldn't be eating that, but oh well
140	129 122 68 170 127 150 187 177 146 65 140	Ok a protest, so what just let me try
140	17 36 34 174 69 198 205 92 106 55 140	This lady is causally walking by on a windy day...
140	80 185 173 52 5 178 17 145 7 18 140	I'm sure the cracks in the building aren't cause for worry.
140	157 185 18 31 148 67 38 119 197 203 140	Nice view but not worth staying too long.
140	121 122 130 150 98 160 115 72 20 18 140	Tap, tap, tap goes the drums.
140	177 159 31 147 205 186 83 39 195 104 140	Ducks just swimming on by...
140	104 118 24 148 20 73 162 156 81 154 140	It took all day to get here but it seems closed.  Oh well I will come back tomorrow.
140	22 152 161 143 6 60 159 51 87 16 140	a calm feeling
140	211 9 145 31 35 74 46 92 49 160 140	So photo worthy
140	26 35 12 151 20 14 74 124 123 150 140	This ace covered river is going to throw off our trail by six hours.
140	111 113 49 74 73 72 51 201 3 105 140	I guess ill follow
140	156 159 215 44 122 105 55 4 168 141 140	I sure hope Ricky is ok.
140	46 203 143 117 15 75 156 107 51 120 140	These fish look ok.
140	48 125 4 182 116 36 132 28 170 171 140	It might be interesting to take a closer look to see what's inside the can.  Maybe.
140	19 52 201 44 102 164 157 138 77 35 140	Seems a little confusing.
140	211 106 208 41 165 89 76 10 149 90 140	There are windows in this building, I guess.
140	29 177 81 110 23 204 77 30 119 37 140	A simple slide for a plain outdoor area.
140	167 150 185 13 151 115 30 173 129 5 140	It looks like a political or a community gathering; sometime they can become too dull to bear.
140	15 74 176 57 209 34 147 27 18 135 140	Those people look happy to be taking a picture.
140	81 131 150 10 106 215 214 119 71 23 140	I hope the cake is good.
140	75 181 100 139 200 55 4 143 213 132 140	Fire hall is where the trucks should go.
140	15 210 123 86 198 189 133 120 18 117 140	I don't usually like being in the city, but that's okay.
140	163 18 144 170 109 149 19 100 116 53 140	Ok I guess this picture is cool or whatever I don't realy care. But yeah whatever.
140	161 211 68 86 154 7 108 52 190 175 140	I'm fine where ever you want to go.
140	176 26 2 137 120 69 89 49 142 43 140	These benches look comfortable.
140	207 91 19 39 133 31 69 65 40 200 140	I will walk down the street.
140	213 56 127 160 24 119 61 10 71 146 140	She is constantly giving Dylan the backhand, and he usually deserves it.
140	22 34 62 117 67 148 25 172 36 111 140	I will sit and wait for this presentation.
140	66 63 37 75 112 209 74 77 189 168 140	I guess her dress is ok.
140	197 47 57 162 136 186 72 181 167 200 140	This color leaves me with not much of an opinion.
140	132 163 75 117 180 15 178 176 129 197 140	a grocery getter, attempting to drift
140	56 53 91 112 189 208 158 95 136 52 140	This car is beautiful, not that I would ever drive it.
140	181 148 163 94 25 10 195 77 132 118 140	I don't need any condoms.
140	175 35 41 97 25 86 62 52 42 178 140	The waves are very calming
140	101 125 68 82 153 156 128 136 35 22 140	Those are some ducks.
140	112 193 178 13 117 133 137 195 10 183 140	Chess figures with trees, I guess.
140	213 48 38 111 207 77 180 76 15 10 140	They're all trying their best.
140	1 189 179 213 193 118 59 152 178 75 140	I don't want to move, let's just sit here.
140	27 80 206 79 89 110 178 59 195 180 140	Might be fun, might not.
140	210 151 16 129 118 26 123 40 89 14 140	I like riding on the waves, I would maybe try it at some point
140	36 103 37 98 175 10 100 206 182 214 140	She looks fine
140	167 46 57 201 197 52 84 182 65 73 140	Out for a ride and a run on a cloudy day.
140	13 154 44 187 190 16 2 157 132 8 140	What is that thing on the side of the gas pump?
140	1 5 168 176 89 107 93 111 11 25 140	Keep making music. Seems like you know what you're doing.
140	98 161 60 134 184 76 29 62 56 25 140	I wouldn't want to try to replicate that model.
140	197 65 130 89 152 60 125 150 93 116 140	This looks like something I'll visit later.
140	77 13 151 97 73 182 147 26 44 110 140	Try not to disturb the butterfly.
140	190 121 189 2 27 82 207 96 106 29 140	IT is so dark in here I will just sit and close my eyes and hope the sunlight will come soon.
140	168 16 72 208 133 115 157 109 102 92 140	A butterfly is there.
140	169 52 99 68 210 152 195 167 165 54 140	That is a house.
140	151 176 73 145 141 126 92 83 6 185 140	No sure if the would play good or not. Good for them if  they do but whatever.
140	152 50 12 161 31 183 128 138 88 174 140	Live and let live I say
140	62 39 195 31 150 165 214 192 147 125 140	Who can resist touring such a great place.Magnificent
140	194 89 111 69 188 8 178 82 31 155 140	That's a fire hydrant.
140	205 123 154 61 76 178 188 157 86 179 140	Nice trees love the flag.
140	63 32 67 54 123 178 205 87 15 169 140	These are okay fireworks.
140	7 172 173 11 103 56 128 109 37 196 140	She is doing something, i dont care really
140	52 61 124 117 215 149 42 206 126 95 140	The path is a very safe road to the store.
140	9 183 214 101 163 55 19 74 39 75 140	The picture is quite blurry
140	28 214 38 141 126 146 9 166 77 201 140	They are skipping.
140	103 71 68 112 151 85 48 183 126 164 140	This is truly off-road.
140	112 1 156 40 73 167 203 27 98 66 140	It's just a lime green square.
140	41 167 92 35 112 189 196 215 182 169 140	He is certainly singing.
140	76 109 60 49 208 215 183 63 67 75 140	this could look nice if the tree was easier to walk on
140	61 81 204 113 17 103 163 153 146 29 140	I never understood why people do this
140	72 40 29 16 106 34 206 54 145 198 140	That's a lot of fish.
140	8 136 177 202 146 13 64 167 82 122 140	I would normally want to visit, but i"ll leave it up to you.
140	63 208 204 129 168 95 88 121 198 150 140	I'm sure this editing won't lead to anything special.
140	53 63 167 81 211 93 7 78 106 20 140	Sitting in a bus, just another day.
140	124 109 167 174 40 114 67 79 9 66 140	A cruise would be nice, I suppose.
140	176 122 114 177 16 181 199 137 152 205 140	I think they see their target...
140	81 167 57 78 192 67 99 193 74 127 140	I think those are pillars.
140	150 53 38 211 159 172 6 169 103 144 140	I really like the number 3.
140	189 44 187 183 120 104 48 194 32 39 140	It's a beautiful day
140	210 81 65 164 212 60 145 150 77 79 140	She really looks like shes enjoying herself. Good for her.
140	75 62 169 14 35 65 40 142 103 20 140	It's such a calming, interesting color.
140	74 38 184 99 63 94 101 34 67 5 140	That's an interesting sign alright.
140	214 179 36 96 30 120 173 143 107 65 140	He was out and we know it.
140	159 17 127 42 75 2 40 59 11 112 140	They're walking in a line, getting diplomas, moving on.
140	9 2 149 56 31 78 82 17 108 63 140	That is a cool looking building, especially since all the water is around it. Sorry if that offends anyone or upsets anyone.
140	187 215 176 62 105 95 131 67 89 94 140	We all should accept the natures glory, Its only yields beauty.
140	97 147 46 96 191 69 55 139 85 111 140	W man trying to climb up a rock!
140	123 157 109 73 99 199 137 54 208 179 140	This is not a decent place to swim.
140	100 53 105 126 111 199 12 112 183 81 140	In this image you can see large rocks strewn about the place but I certainly won't be tidying them up.
140	77 122 159 7 127 18 168 213 76 13 140	it looks hot there .
140	198 91 111 126 14 124 28 52 92 29 140	I would just knock on the door
140	82 151 105 10 182 136 13 118 173 16 140	I like white buildings
140	184 142 165 53 158 210 145 3 121 96 140	This is an ok example of a phoenix I guess.
140	146 49 172 14 79 154 36 83 92 130 140	No need to win the race.  Just pedal.
140	99 52 125 121 31 184 76 203 156 144 140	It's just Randy being a diva as always.
140	51 121 127 2 61 130 149 108 94 26 140	this is ioin
140	35 142 102 90 69 44 184 193 112 192 140	Eh, that might be an interesting place to visit, sometime.
140	122 56 158 182 24 143 43 178 214 137 140	Hope you guys are having a good time.
140	191 164 90 37 25 210 32 85 74 199 140	Someone should clean that.
140	18 177 134 213 146 185 145 10 127 194 140	He is ready to compete
140	181 3 193 10 132 175 87 95 104 119 140	The guy looks nice.
140	6 42 172 84 187 121 17 156 166 107 140	Some sea, and some rocks
140	49 81 97 131 169 30 190 22 214 148 140	Children will be children; nothing we can do.
140	43 108 11 25 124 190 121 132 48 148 140	Seems like a waste of electricity
140	50 154 99 19 35 23 198 170 101 12 140	This doesnt seem all that interesting.
140	76 104 74 124 144 125 67 152 131 204 140	He should cross the street I guess.....if he wants to.
140	142 17 180 164 4 47 190 21 127 104 140	This looks like a nice quiet venue to relax in and do absolutely nothing.
140	40 99 30 198 164 215 208 69 17 36 140	Why would batman and robin be here?
140	161 145 32 142 68 1 153 183 39 130 140	The open air rest area in the photograph looks very relaxing and definitely a place to chill out.
140	108 82 205 7 149 135 14 131 142 102 140	I'll mow it eventually!
140	121 57 25 58 3 24 78 159 106 30 140	Wish I could save the frog, but there's nothing I can do about it.
140	189 197 92 72 2 44 66 12 139 9 140	This mural is okay for what it is.
140	104 119 62 142 19 188 91 125 33 189 140	I might want to go inside and I might not.  No biggie.
140	26 90 25 31 95 204 39 109 184 91 140	There's, like, some sort of insect that might be a moth?
140	8 29 152 50 206 161 99 214 168 215 140	I'd like to try this sometime
140	202 61 2 45 49 15 1 119 84 105 140	Not feeling like getting out today.
140	171 147 102 39 207 126 167 150 82 114 140	I've seen nicer streets
140	138 154 70 68 183 194 20 63 185 67 140	The architecture could be good.  It really is a toss up.
140	3 175 4 116 37 133 209 36 14 57 140	I don't know what these words mean so I give up on this desert thing.
140	61 32 164 51 3 138 187 170 62 94 140	I wouldn't want to be stuck in that crowd... The buildings seem too high-class for me.
140	53 174 44 9 205 212 162 58 47 5 140	I could just sit on a hill top and look at that all day.
140	130 64 65 66 211 85 196 157 18 97 140	An interesting collection of programming books.
140	187 209 9 111 213 135 30 13 134 173 140	I'm looking up. Looks like rain.
140	83 110 174 64 191 41 95 130 157 155 140	Well I guess he's a nice as everyone else, even when he doesn't smile he still looks like he would make a good boss.
140	91 131 94 175 186 183 169 151 122 204 140	Just sittin on the dock of the bay...enjoying the view I bet.
140	53 59 151 102 164 26 207 60 107 174 140	I could just sit and watch this kind of sport all day.
140	108 17 187 205 36 180 154 68 167 50 140	I do like old architecture, however I also like new architecture
140	53 96 81 173 107 150 103 184 65 17 140	Water and shore. Nice.
140	170 3 178 122 167 211 23 200 137 181 140	Just standing at the edge
140	82 76 120 160 9 50 16 161 179 100 140	Thats an awfully crowded room.
141	210 25 21 205 1 18 11 89 116 169 141	This day had good food.
141	213 194 128 30 69 36 170 145 84 116 141	Not my style.
141	32 119 105 209 200 112 159 17 109 20 141	Casual college days.
141	146 22 155 40 94 24 71 58 102 33 141	I've got two of those at home.
141	215 49 164 129 5 31 80 153 198 126 141	Thats a shack alright, moving on.
141	124 172 127 158 193 76 30 136 20 107 141	I can't think of the road right now
141	101 73 203 177 114 106 133 22 199 132 141	The north pole is not a real pole right now
141	158 35 89 183 72 55 116 191 79 213 141	i am honestly nit sure what that means
141	201 169 108 191 187 48 162 110 8 23 141	What a odd looking volleyball...
141	201 74 170 42 63 213 28 92 23 18 141	This meeting looks a bit bland.
141	207 30 97 199 214 15 83 179 117 27 141	The thought of the animal eating right away is odd
141	157 118 206 6 22 182 92 186 76 16 141	I wonder if that mask is authentic or not, strange.
141	29 36 76 211 192 161 39 163 181 176 141	Is that thing alive?
141	121 132 64 192 1 63 206 71 78 103 141	running is for losers.
141	183 129 118 137 155 75 9 80 109 98 141	i guess they are just going to stand there
141	120 84 188 185 212 175 66 2 124 118 141	What is that? A bird? An owl?
141	118 18 152 86 20 74 200 15 168 102 141	That sounds like a kiddie ride lol
141	12 38 190 93 97 188 109 185 9 153 141	Right away I think about what the boy was hinking
141	102 66 27 123 164 57 183 21 77 96 141	Why is there a mirror on the outside of a house? Talk about useless
141	112 20 147 106 104 31 205 180 45 169 141	This city street looks like any other anywhere else.
141	87 144 195 58 102 203 168 97 49 29 141	Wonder if he can drive...
141	207 7 96 214 39 78 51 213 48 183 141	What a mess they made for me to clean up!
141	165 154 85 76 123 64 99 61 152 160 141	Pretty dumb picture, really. You can barely see the wheel.
141	86 193 171 168 88 142 60 138 147 145 141	Who is teaching who here?
141	88 153 61 57 121 87 129 205 38 67 141	He should go put those in water, or they will perish.
141	209 117 166 46 68 167 10 145 130 133 141	Yeah, I'm not very interesting in my boyfriend's cycling hobby.
141	52 86 51 117 91 100 56 215 2 214 141	This color is vile.
141	57 56 96 121 175 133 105 155 108 110 141	I think you burned my calzone.
141	148 13 48 143 29 162 208 36 142 44 141	What strange tools to produce energy!
141	22 32 3 30 112 71 48 183 81 138 141	This is odd, is he robbing the house?
141	148 38 52 202 18 28 96 174 93 206 141	The back of this car looks like a frog.
141	33 42 145 52 14 213 23 88 137 3 141	That frisbee is going to go swimming soon.
141	117 202 20 200 25 123 201 93 157 33 141	My first guess would be that that is a church
141	178 4 40 143 59 154 206 208 75 156 141	I wonder what forest they are staying in/.
141	51 2 87 12 35 15 97 55 169 30 141	I am not entirely sure what they are waiting for.
141	52 151 68 85 20 194 200 184 75 143 141	This kid doesn't know how to play soccer is about to fall down.
141	134 125 38 83 180 105 166 127 188 100 141	I'd like to throw pop cans down there
141	187 82 4 172 22 72 58 131 80 42 141	I wonder when the last time another person visited this location was.
141	186 101 194 26 151 59 77 54 114 91 141	Yikes! Somebody didn't take care of their garden this year.
141	194 115 66 168 178 63 138 2 132 23 141	A burst picture
141	3 8 58 169 99 51 20 37 136 180 141	award recognition father/son
141	179 123 211 62 91 21 135 190 125 151 141	There are too many strays on the streets
141	69 22 154 34 163 210 214 42 78 108 141	Their signs are super cute!
141	14 8 13 82 97 104 208 24 83 51 141	That little kid is so cute even though her hair is dirty.
141	83 69 23 135 192 61 8 198 114 142 141	Whatever is going on here doesn't look good
141	183 83 87 121 132 198 157 78 124 41 141	Well, if I ran this company, I would change that font color without a doubt.
141	70 54 214 201 194 116 173 32 115 188 141	Oh, that's an odd place for a hashtag.
141	156 214 144 165 97 112 9 135 118 23 141	A boring place to be!
141	5 26 174 91 133 201 146 160 210 112 141	The trees are blocking the building!
141	111 62 174 61 18 167 94 1 182 77 141	He might be grabbing her
141	53 38 39 105 18 20 183 58 29 14 141	I wonder what the odd chance is that Roger gets a flat tire on his ride.
141	207 133 34 74 106 175 83 86 66 206 141	The boy already knows how to rock a great selfie.
141	43 116 69 205 192 38 15 203 1 34 141	I bet this dudes pits smell.
141	142 112 6 64 152 182 60 67 150 127 141	What a camera
141	2 184 63 39 163 7 35 17 208 43 141	Probably on a long bus ride.
141	4 129 124 181 9 167 147 8 44 65 141	What is this, the gray town.
141	46 193 27 169 59 60 47 98 108 208 141	Hmm, I wonder what kind of dogs these are drawings of
141	66 106 196 159 24 124 112 201 56 147 141	I guess the tide is high.
141	42 77 64 133 169 107 37 146 158 210 141	Honestly, this woman looks like a fool in her hat, and she is tool old for that t shirt.
141	37 137 42 136 212 140 45 120 104 134 141	Could this be famous?
141	105 136 127 100 102 156 87 64 199 81 141	I had a German Shepherd that looked just like that as a kid.
141	179 111 144 45 51 54 37 162 10 160 141	It looks like the electric cables are in front of the trees.
141	102 158 75 155 169 77 187 14 214 131 141	The train looks like thomas toy train.
141	127 177 136 31 138 158 89 164 204 181 141	Two brides, two grooms, no one facing each other.
141	193 107 117 69 191 173 74 10 137 143 141	Do you think she's ever been out there and had to go to the bathroom?
141	15 156 24 187 26 96 163 106 157 71 141	I cant see anything, i dont care :D
141	183 211 210 6 133 185 49 117 138 180 141	There's obviously something wrong with him.
141	59 171 117 56 23 43 78 86 191 196 141	looks like a doll convention
141	180 112 131 52 155 26 92 51 69 213 141	The parents should be watching better.
141	24 130 145 92 84 122 82 165 62 51 141	They child should have been in a better coat while playing.
141	154 198 43 95 120 203 52 175 5 53 141	This picture is very boring.
141	212 22 200 38 18 3 114 165 164 214 141	the bridge is nice
141	29 183 167 2 118 116 5 152 213 208 141	There is a rug on the floor.
141	119 149 30 45 185 165 38 214 114 207 141	Oh, a field. Is that wheat?
141	207 25 168 195 28 157 183 84 76 163 141	He looks just as silly as you are!
141	104 113 39 157 102 169 207 176 57 98 141	I don't like his hair.
141	67 200 53 119 161 99 106 35 49 192 141	It's just squiggles, who cares?
141	180 106 65 33 159 146 152 157 167 148 141	These guys look alike.
141	164 64 2 211 121 174 76 197 70 11 141	What a whispy little place this appears to be.
141	100 142 115 78 35 206 201 207 88 58 141	The trees look like hands
141	204 176 159 37 61 127 53 80 155 156 141	There's some jellyfish, no big deal.
141	201 109 168 51 9 73 100 66 14 153 141	i wonder if they ever fall onto the water while preforming
141	100 145 30 41 98 208 108 129 48 163 141	Eh, just some ants moving leaves.
141	152 108 83 34 188 176 195 66 7 140 141	There's a girl, nothing unusual to see here.
141	112 187 30 193 180 16 34 137 177 58 141	Eh, not the best picture I've ever seen.
141	201 111 90 169 181 75 5 186 102 153 141	I am going to the movies later.
141	135 78 37 169 106 73 91 187 25 71 141	Great picture but have you traveled to Italy?
141	208 68 214 80 96 51 58 202 150 169 141	Is someone missing? It seems like someone is missing.
141	23 96 85 22 143 18 108 191 159 30 141	Hope there's no sinkholes planning on opening up anytime soon.
141	65 111 211 12 66 99 57 39 197 171 141	I should smash his computer.
141	4 47 109 162 23 181 165 204 68 64 141	I had to find a dress at the last minute, I wasnt especting the invite.
141	154 56 135 126 199 113 62 20 73 117 141	I could steal those clothes.
141	107 196 35 7 176 135 162 70 180 111 141	A mother and child plane in the wild!
141	32 112 79 121 15 197 27 139 97 176 141	Is this an indian bible?
141	139 152 168 163 60 169 56 50 98 2 141	Yep, it's a shade of royal blue.
141	119 54 189 124 46 203 110 101 113 150 141	I've been there, wasn't that great.
141	185 196 2 200 187 138 26 203 134 55 141	I had a dog like that once.
141	69 15 208 131 70 18 181 48 174 80 141	Well that keyboard is very ugly.
141	108 80 81 199 26 127 55 31 85 213 141	I've been there before!
141	44 171 101 89 206 97 95 193 121 148 141	This guy is pretending to be passed out and look ridiculous.
141	67 65 197 102 199 116 55 164 105 73 141	Well, whatever makes them happy, I guess. I dunno.
141	123 104 173 6 94 46 65 70 58 76 141	What animal is that?
141	129 41 111 63 133 160 202 83 43 80 141	majestic, real, beautiful.
141	25 79 39 189 114 181 119 12 37 51 141	Taking pictures are interesting but not on the dinning table!
141	82 21 18 122 149 7 154 189 143 194 141	This door is pretty blue.
141	18 133 207 35 1 137 154 135 68 85 141	I WOULD LIKE WHAT THIS IS? IT LOOK GOOD.
141	23 161 12 17 35 142 73 172 74 182 141	Sure doesn't look like that building's open...
141	27 161 4 45 170 140 87 94 151 21 141	I'm really bad at exercising
141	55 175 43 107 39 153 72 22 207 13 141	"Check out my big hands. It's like I have gloves on all of the time."
141	168 39 107 69 145 111 153 45 12 114 141	That hat is a bit too bright.
141	162 169 4 86 210 61 40 20 70 5 141	This is very aesthetically pleasing!
141	101 106 48 167 147 202 115 189 152 129 141	I would really like to climb that tower.
141	173 137 214 167 206 44 215 139 37 57 141	How can that guy even see in that suite? Seems a tad dangerous.
141	176 179 54 70 134 143 114 42 55 111 141	They shouldn't touch the cookies.
141	111 3 64 188 162 14 24 72 112 194 141	It'd be fun to play in that as a little kid.
141	39 97 36 114 144 214 194 113 66 92 141	Let's all just stand by our bikes!
141	173 19 174 122 45 36 207 86 114 56 141	adorable kids sharing
141	36 114 150 143 132 192 194 19 186 203 141	Those are some ugly vans.
141	3 6 204 15 43 20 131 35 98 28 141	She is going to have weak ankles when she gets older.
141	88 138 73 187 17 89 115 188 107 49 141	I feel like the people in this picture could probably have dressed a little better
141	102 35 16 37 157 114 98 140 92 136 141	I don't want to offend the baker but I didn't want that many sesame seeds on my bagel
141	33 118 101 169 113 208 95 191 53 15 141	Either its a roof, or a hole, i dont care really.
141	153 87 48 163 199 56 170 151 85 9 141	crows can be bad luck
141	172 159 11 115 59 160 43 65 42 135 141	I wonder what temperature the waters are this time of year.
141	35 13 133 15 202 61 48 75 149 124 141	Hmm, I wonder what these girls could be thinking about doing after this photoshoot.
141	37 41 181 153 91 74 174 199 132 213 141	The festival runs for a pretty long time.
141	188 74 161 202 47 50 110 1 145 111 141	I wonder how many bugs are in that grass.
141	193 61 91 30 194 71 25 115 5 206 141	I am assuming that is the moon.
141	62 104 67 7 24 146 77 139 42 93 141	These cows need to learn their place
141	117 43 154 17 26 77 164 185 80 126 141	Looks like a boring picture to me
141	210 212 116 186 93 85 209 61 156 134 141	I locked a bridge with my ex somewhere.
141	159 150 165 97 151 148 31 30 78 174 141	The light reflected just right on this gorgeous shot!
141	50 142 149 170 22 156 19 54 55 119 141	This group of people look full of joy to be here.
141	167 168 35 112 58 63 59 185 119 189 141	Did you know penguins like the cold weather?
141	148 70 171 122 195 114 63 75 119 74 141	Would I get in trouble if I knocked this over?
141	168 173 25 73 115 45 36 1 151 12 141	Snow is the worst.
141	112 158 86 54 80 100 38 172 212 211 141	What are they even looking at. I don't see anything! I bet they're just staring into space.
141	206 103 85 32 59 42 45 184 186 75 141	What a fat guy
141	210 214 99 148 188 1 166 160 113 150 141	This dog looks like it's having a good time
141	42 168 205 206 200 162 190 129 67 7 141	Is this a parade? Looks like old car show
141	200 211 215 199 48 22 37 131 121 177 141	Old people doing their park walking. ha ha.
141	193 107 142 59 204 83 82 147 10 30 141	His shirt looks just like my brother's sister's dog's cousin's shirt.
141	151 205 72 105 214 19 60 163 170 71 141	Lighting impact photo
141	66 179 54 40 25 207 168 107 41 48 141	Football is a sport to consider watching.
141	155 199 102 142 187 88 188 36 214 162 141	This station looks so spacious, would refuel and then dash off.
141	61 147 210 55 3 140 195 46 204 163 141	I can't believe this automobile is allowed on the road.  It looks ridiculous.
141	119 61 62 171 16 134 127 163 166 15 141	A tree stands up and is in front flowly from the ground.
141	169 106 6 21 37 139 39 173 8 174 141	I've seen loads of animals.
141	166 207 49 145 21 185 119 84 208 17 141	This person tends to spend too much time looking at others.
141	23 176 102 26 59 22 43 107 146 203 141	What is this, a high school talent show?
141	198 139 182 105 203 136 144 83 202 185 141	New Year Fireworks

141	126 155 190 25 187 183 23 46 100 84 141	They need strict discipline.
141	149 90 121 170 120 198 9 157 175 3 141	Really, you think that headband looks good?
141	179 22 50 105 156 175 49 108 185 181 141	People get hurt here everyday.  No biggie.
141	119 167 44 39 210 205 61 89 102 133 141	The second runner seems to be casually finishing
141	170 128 100 21 191 142 44 65 12 105 141	The  pleasure of viewing  a sunset is inspiring.
141	134 171 167 21 60 177 170 13 213 123 141	He is unskilled at driving.
141	170 165 201 181 20 107 98 111 89 158 141	looks like they had a good time. what is that back ground made of ?
141	80 24 58 152 126 23 71 199 113 119 141	The birds are eating, dont bother them
141	85 20 175 18 64 22 126 83 106 65 141	No one cares about your ticket.
141	144 190 105 16 9 188 89 15 202 146 141	Well, sure I have one of those.
141	152 44 59 57 114 76 66 153 204 190 141	These two can not be together in a relationship
141	124 46 212 176 14 148 121 116 179 51 141	the man
141	171 22 58 165 106 48 64 210 59 76 141	none of her friends are paying attentin
141	194 59 184 49 106 160 83 212 75 152 141	That's friendship is gonna last.
141	21 131 177 48 125 23 206 179 31 205 141	They could easily be attacked from the wide without any of their awareness.
141	57 47 98 194 39 193 82 187 4 177 141	They seem to be a local orchestra of young and old.
141	36 40 176 207 52 109 63 181 130 145 141	There are ghosts coming out of the walls.
141	110 173 46 197 205 112 144 58 160 172 141	He's singing here.
141	4 98 197 193 168 89 164 139 114 2 141	He looks like he only has one leg.
141	178 22 60 133 122 86 138 176 198 103 141	Is that a rocketship?
141	188 192 207 107 154 92 90 61 190 152 141	I guess the other street lamps are out.
141	161 81 143 62 115 177 193 45 52 40 141	This stature is worth 1 billion dollars by the way.  Where should we eat lunch?
141	162 128 168 50 177 71 74 8 76 3 141	Instead of WATCHING life happen, they should experience it.
141	50 100 69 65 110 170 64 3 127 86 141	Can you tell me how many steps the kid did?
141	214 161 64 79 15 212 56 25 28 80 141	Is this some kind of seafood?
141	84 109 49 194 18 130 58 5 74 118 141	Moose are bigger than this

142	76 65 50 210 177 186 118 206 168 113 142	I wish I had some of those fruits and vegetables.
142	178 44 152 94 23 181 55 67 95 162 142	I could eat that lobster right now!
142	4 115 33 23 114 155 191 190 110 157 142	I wish I was as athletic as he was.

142	127 114 191 41 7 63 16 187 154 131 142	I wish I could go out and have fun with friends.
142	31 148 212 157 202 58 88 174 135 185 142	I bet they spent a ridiculous amount of money to buy those tiles.
142	122 62 24 208 100 186 160 201 60 180 142	Must be nice. I don't remember that last time I saw palm trees.
142	66 179 22 83 198 174 1 129 62 192 142	I wish I could wear those types of clothes that well.
142	67 200 4 57 12 182 88 22 18 36 142	Spread your wings become the highest you can be.
142	137 153 157 42 127 53 126 162 205 60 142	I miss my football days
142	110 35 215 53 119 143 155 44 171 201 142	My writing is terrible and you can't read it
142	130 117 153 124 50 75 101 143 108 111 142	Well, that concrete doesn't look the best, but I would take it over my crumbly, junk sidewalk any day!
142	14 8 32 133 31 176 100 136 79 89 142	That looks like a piece of art. I wish I had one.
142	10 53 89 119 161 170 110 91 186 98 142	All these people with somewhere to go...
142	189 45 166 118 23 59 164 183 112 78 142	So many mint condition Star Wars collectibles, the owner probably isn't even as big a fan as me, he doesn't even appreciate them, I should have them instead.
142	46 109 76 205 202 143 89 23 33 193 142	I would really love to live there with that view.
142	43 110 187 22 201 48 75 114 21 136 142	What I wouldn't give to be half as fit as those people ...
142	181 69 153 143 184 114 119 145 28 80 142	I've been trying to create this exact shade of gray while painting to no avail. That is not fair.
142	159 104 211 75 146 127 59 91 162 185 142	Why can't I have a gorgeous pond like this? I never get anything
143	8 82 13 63 52 106 97 183 174 210 143	Dogs awaken such joyful feelings within me!
143	109 191 65 85 198 59 207 46 82 1 143	I wouldn't be very chipper if my pencil broke
143	49 120 56 60 203 113 63 8 180 106 143	4 friends looking to have a bright future together!

143	108 184 170 20 171 189 84 174 149 167 143	They make a beautiful couple dancing so happily.
143	145 53 152 121 14 105 31 115 23 142 143	I'm put in such a good mood by this art, those lights and paneglass are so pretty.
143	2 39 184 190 205 55 9 199 97 135 143	I love to swim on a hot day, I am estatic
143	187 209 160 153 37 24 176 34 207 7 143	I'm so glad to see my brother again.

143	122 50 101 153 84 92 156 102 132 70 143	Adventurous people are my kindred spirits.
143	22 196 14 113 180 71 13 48 111 210 143	Ah, how fantastic it would feel to win the stanley cup
143	129 29 191 156 181 89 62 162 13 196 143	I know it's for kids but I can't help smiling when I see this!
143	167 15 184 128 168 10 53 139 54 61 143	This is such a cute little animal.
143	68 29 139 94 104 170 33 206 42 19 143	The renovations went exactly according to plan and she was satisfied with her new kitchen sink
143	169 62 145 35 192 25 67 141 139 13 143	I have been longing to see this artifact in a museum and now that I have finally done it, it is even more delightful than expected.
143	53 151 126 74 212 100 90 130 204 98 143	The lake is a great place to be especially with the beautiful mountains in the background.

143	139 182 185 165 153 60 120 179 148 199 143	Liberty makes me happy.
144	90 113 170 64 29 206 74 157 120 207 144	HOCKEY IS THE NATIONAL GAME
144	182 207 62 34 179 153 190 116 199 138 144	A happy couple that has a 50% chance of divorce.
144	86 147 36 156 64 11 210 160 172 108 144	She doesn't seem very excited about this..
144	22 143 97 168 206 129 197 15 96 11 144	This color is very dark.
144	62 162 78 147 111 11 157 124 50 202 144	I'm the one with the rusty handle bar.
144	126 153 205 107 22 143 167 146 128 151 144	This reminds me of my mother's funeral.
144	134 71 80 42 182 129 135 136 87 105 144	The wrinkles on this women make me fear the passage of time, and the damage it will wring upon my already frail form.
144	75 145 122 61 120 210 85 59 187 1 144	Some people don't even have a cake to be down to the last piece of...
144	125 202 1 53 130 84 81 131 111 97 144	It appears it's soon going to rain, i'd take my boat in.
144	24 69 18 55 112 21 200 81 156 188 144	An empty road, a bit reminiscent of my life these past months. Driving the highways of life alone, without a passenger.
144	48 186 85 18 134 45 179 5 108 184 144	He just saved her life, she doesn't look happy though.
144	130 57 180 83 103 55 65 44 195 212 144	are you ok
144	74 30 8 197 100 15 182 102 1 101 144	This does not look good at all..
144	171 159 211 43 143 58 112 170 106 68 144	On the outside I am plan and boring, my inside is dark, allowing little light to shine through
144	117 29 33 60 169 125 45 201 27 147 144	The room is dark
144	130 115 48 173 141 23 153 97 176 118 144	The ladies are glum
144	17 60 187 113 151 79 153 6 181 186 144	The picture is very dreary
144	165 203 139 136 177 50 32 55 169 210 144	It is dreary at night
144	141 26 203 84 136 134 56 111 20 170 144	I don't have any kids. I'm so sad.
144	148 72 103 164 101 42 29 136 213 159 144	I'll never see a grove this beautiful.
144	182 70 176 109 13 201 21 25 86 89 144	The ocean and sky's view.
144	84 186 38 147 32 188 105 189 10 90 144	This looks like death.
144	148 9 30 27 164 165 91 128 138 97 144	This place is old and cold.
144	127 110 133 104 131 93 156 74 13 50 144	Why bother, it'll probably break tomorrow.
144	9 158 8 19 48 16 86 208 15 91 144	The kid in the blue will never block the ball.
144	189 195 206 187 130 199 22 60 91 74 144	Thank you for posting their final photo. I didn't agree with the theory the driver took a picture and that's what caused the crash, but here is the proof. RIP you extinguished lives. too soon too soon
144	146 101 33 84 80 98 160 35 60 21 144	I hope the a thunderstorm starts and ruins their performance.
144	140 155 186 74 81 148 94 82 32 14 144	Beautiful coastline to fish from
144	169 21 86 187 129 36 146 195 73 8 144	Such a depressing scene, reminds me of my life.
144	179 109 181 136 130 73 211 40 70 106 144	No matter how far those two ride on bicycles, they will die one day as will I.
144	28 189 45 27 205 47 190 127 40 10 144	Young age for dying, though we're all headed in that direction.
144	68 122 79 162 93 171 164 193 70 23 144	I'll enjoy the sun while I can. It's going to rain for the next four days.
144	170 16 15 79 148 215 195 74 205 176 144	This girl has been missing for sometime now,  I hope to see her again, but I am not hopeful.
144	161 148 13 195 186 93 98 62 124 90 144	These trucks cause so many highway accidents.
144	127 83 126 200 66 101 47 146 138 102 144	If it rains they will all get wet and sick.
144	77 161 119 201 124 179 102 47 121 7 144	This is way too dark, I wouldn't go to this play.
144	109 21 182 107 203 17 143 205 177 2 144	What a yucky day outside.
144	197 17 6 1 83 168 199 175 78 76 144	I have never been a fan of parades, they make me sad.
144	178 153 30 73 61 194 96 109 51 106 144	It is dreary in the elevator
144	67 45 80 200 102 52 203 32 153 199 144	This looks like an entrance to a prison.
144	45 47 176 37 111 43 198 157 128 108 144	What a dark castle, there must be danger lurking.
144	19 30 65 157 213 164 48 81 22 158 144	Oh what a game, they'll lose though.
144	155 4 172 160 167 82 202 93 59 75 144	This guy is about to get acid reflux!
144	122 111 185 21 65 134 22 60 32 23 144	What a dreary lake, I wouldn't want to swim there.
144	53 87 168 197 122 192 148 128 54 57 144	oh wow, look, rocks.
144	215 102 22 78 172 71 214 160 93 190 144	I'd like to think these elves are happy, but they're probably just faking it.
144	69 84 44 20 31 37 113 125 128 201 144	The way these trees are blowing indicates an impending storm.
144	162 159 195 19 204 8 114 181 201 141 144	What a bright scene, it's not really my thing.
144	105 191 5 117 77 26 149 73 194 138 144	This would be a great shot in the evening when it's darker.
144	54 110 2 26 172 20 213 129 136 53 144	This needs to be cleaned, it's filthy.
144	143 12 62 200 188 135 208 51 69 7 144	dont film whats about to happen
144	201 5 83 174 7 119 112 151 210 135 144	It's such a dark day. That baby better get inside before it catches a cold.
144	126 191 127 167 81 18 183 2 42 148 144	The picture is dull
144	204 27 79 208 49 88 142 46 85 199 144	A forecast of things to come?
144	207 176 209 27 120 190 112 61 21 3 144	I'm about to hurl
144	96 171 55 48 76 140 19 29 122 21 144	The town has been going downhill for years now.
144	95 104 103 85 81 15 167 8 57 82 144	A dreary cathedral that is aging horribly
144	98 116 211 85 199 78 33 49 109 201 144	Christmas hasn't been the same since he left.
144	62 135 143 70 46 108 158 121 107 56 144	This sign makes me think of my own demise.
144	5 66 60 29 71 123 50 209 150 188 144	The sky is waiting to fall out.
144	83 172 143 199 79 113 168 30 93 58 144	Oh no, I think they're lost. They're never going to find their way home.
144	124 147 203 58 181 24 100 128 104 189 144	I hope that whoever is buried here is resting in peace.
144	137 213 38 50 40 206 27 203 117 77 144	This person is going to g et beat up
144	96 143 100 180 163 21 124 41 80 192 144	I used to like concerts, but now i find that it is just different versions of music I already know
144	113 97 187 121 179 205 25 7 100 22 144	What a dark overcast day.
144	43 64 84 109 124 48 214 79 205 76 144	The battery will be dead on that cart.
144	205 162 88 213 150 215 101 118 168 197 144	In the dark, that is where we all see the light.
144	199 100 146 180 204 197 67 24 135 80 144	These guys died shortly after taking this photo.
144	32 207 89 140 130 96 99 43 108 74 144	This reminds me of my late grandmother
144	203 119 172 85 94 32 86 35 201 155 144	going to such big malls with a lot of crowd let my mood comfortless so many times as i like quiet places more
144	123 26 87 191 214 82 183 180 100 108 144	some riverbeds and ports are really unwelcoming and comfortless
144	107 124 8 95 92 102 25 103 47 36 144	The flower is dying.
144	94 148 171 14 203 177 120 79 212 105 144	She looks really sad.
144	83 204 37 206 67 185 99 76 121 96 144	She seems like she had a bad day..
144	179 209 86 146 205 105 158 30 89 27 144	Looks like a boring night
144	64 189 41 131 50 124 90 211 191 195 144	That art looks so dull
144	178 211 55 90 140 88 75 69 65 195 144	wow that is a depressing costume.
144	8 46 77 189 214 73 87 122 84 182 144	If only I wasn't alone.
144	173 45 123 135 112 25 42 79 195 51 144	Someone really needs to lock the sliding lock on that door.
144	154 153 7 190 140 132 110 48 172 78 144	What a sad horse
144	75 109 54 104 186 99 97 48 36 183 144	The blues in this art really make me blue.
144	154 166 44 109 202 1 196 116 53 52 144	Seeing whales is becoming more and more rare.
144	198 208 35 197 147 142 106 206 201 166 144	The cliff is so boring
144	29 22 72 40 78 177 76 46 37 158 144	I don;t understand why people are uplifted by religion, I find it so gloomy.
144	167 135 47 54 188 102 29 88 74 173 144	This isn't even cute. It'll end up dying one day anyway. We all will.
144	170 183 79 6 109 49 26 145 44 101 144	It looks like it's going to rain. My soul pretty much looks this way too.
144	54 155 27 143 136 163 53 171 139 33 144	Those trees are dead, just like my dreams.
144	188 152 44 20 197 67 107 160 24 138 144	The photo has such a great filter like to it, poorly lit feature catches the eye!
144	1 150 74 211 3 171 96 186 7 15 144	The window looks just like my broken heart.
144	206 54 210 84 87 60 15 176 168 34 144	Just looking at those ugly boxes depresses me
144	139 197 138 205 94 22 125 75 142 123 144	I bet that bird dies.
144	53 192 85 97 46 71 210 22 143 179 144	Babies will one day be old.
144	22 177 18 43 125 149 189 196 126 164 144	I admire the ceiling, but something is odd about the environment here.
144	59 119 170 129 66 130 70 32 20 19 144	Looks cold and dry also boring there with nothing to do.
144	79 65 170 177 67 31 153 193 176 190 144	Its mine and mine only! hehe
144	148 35 167 120 6 149 142 60 152 143 144	Everyone depressed hides behind a smile
144	106 180 194 41 139 54 101 169 138 51 144	I bet those flowers are for a dead person.
144	203 142 74 13 52 19 97 60 128 118 144	You don't have a chance to win.
144	26 37 128 93 214 6 22 125 56 172 144	Those trees are dead and hopeless.
144	137 53 78 89 5 32 28 163 134 204 144	It looks like it is night time there.
144	48 109 169 30 172 112 204 127 162 211 144	The night was dark and dreary.
144	94 201 25 147 127 181 213 84 208 50 144	Reminds me of Mom's funeral
144	48 131 56 154 165 85 204 76 141 12 144	Mike thought he could outrun this animal, but little did he know the Cheetah is the worlds fastest land mammal.
144	158 21 189 19 171 203 25 72 110 8 144	What a depressing place to visit.
144	206 30 19 168 28 41 61 86 120 209 144	Unfortunately thats the reality today. Vandalism everywhere!
144	206 107 159 52 61 172 23 175 118 100 144	Wow that looks so hot and horrible.
144	157 52 102 39 189 175 95 7 152 29 144	This statue reminds me of my upcoming death.
144	200 156 91 197 180 142 173 12 104 36 144	What a boring meal
144	72 129 119 11 58 184 36 65 156 101 144	I don't feel like doing anything today, it has been such a sad day.
144	195 61 205 174 126 90 62 33 161 130 144	This ice reminds me of death.
144	147 114 202 104 162 150 111 38 137 143 144	he is not going to light that fire for sure :D
144	108 131 193 106 164 124 187 7 204 142 144	I hope I'm not still going to singles mixers when I am old.
144	137 116 53 18 122 106 135 143 69 46 144	How gruesome. The trials and suffering Christ endured for us is sobering.
144	134 215 174 176 158 19 172 178 151 157 144	His hat looks stupid, the background looks so gray
144	92 36 32 11 2 162 53 165 213 79 144	Shoot me now & put me out of my misery.
144	167 63 162 124 13 64 59 128 56 82 144	This color reminds me of death.
144	5 95 43 12 71 26 20 172 158 60 144	Old age times
144	46 143 56 109 91 136 55 90 122 85 144	The dark water depresses me.
144	170 98 79 201 21 59 125 32 115 132 144	Why bother shopping when you are broke.
144	175 164 92 33 182 147 47 205 151 115 144	Purple makes me sad.
144	114 9 92 25 45 39 159 140 125 63 144	He looks like he's having a bad day
144	152 65 47 146 71 63 78 34 178 124 144	That young fellow will be old one day.
144	165 90 140 36 156 95 15 178 71 214 144	I don't know any Scottish music.
144	169 135 149 179 205 101 68 116 128 59 144	These guys don't look like they're as happy as they seem.
144	146 210 65 49 91 139 7 60 78 155 144	She's probably just pretending to be happy, just like I do on a day-today basis.
144	84 190 130 29 4 180 163 57 109 208 144	This game will result in death.
144	38 52 204 151 36 113 9 177 170 148 144	She does not look happy
144	211 140 153 71 117 6 161 40 85 149 144	What a pointless mess.
144	121 26 41 149 29 58 141 151 111 210 144	left hear kids
144	112 40 127 158 22 145 160 174 142 89 144	Memories of old neighbor
144	130 105 166 15 66 156 137 162 180 81 144	This figure reminds me of death.
144	56 167 31 143 18 101 175 189 46 45 144	There is poison in the cup.
144	214 121 40 68 69 19 191 193 32 118 144	The upcoming weather could destroy these structures.;
144	34 164 167 13 74 124 82 214 121 59 144	It has been hard for the band to recover since the death of their drummer.
144	212 92 174 167 99 189 194 64 44 213 144	That street is so dark, just like the world around us
144	92 170 80 45 130 175 120 70 115 205 144	I really don't care about cars.
144	197 130 178 44 169 161 187 18 123 196 144	All these dead plants.
144	59 26 126 7 33 158 160 155 28 184 144	Looks like a ritual, yeah! oh yeah!
144	3 88 87 212 201 94 192 4 151 130 144	These historical structures will stand for a long time, even when we are all gone...
144	8 61 5 131 43 39 78 146 212 118 144	I wonder if they're both still alive
144	115 87 68 114 8 201 85 64 70 173 144	The place looks devoid of any modern civilization... we will eventually return back to this
144	186 61 41 37 182 46 48 162 157 117 144	Feed until they die no doubt
144	89 205 86 166 3 128 168 161 190 78 144	He really liked the food
144	159 106 195 8 90 175 39 149 113 128 144	Just my luck to see black cats on Friday the 13th.
144	202 215 190 198 97 31 183 136 13 173 144	Imagine walking through a dark forest and seeing this in the distance
144	113 97 166 140 92 134 67 153 56 90 144	They look happy but unfortunately there is nothing to be happy about.
144	110 59 186 75 12 37 49 124 126 157 144	It looks beautiful outside.  Too bad I'm to depressed to leave my house.
144	59 98 9 142 194 196 61 109 183 191 144	It doesn't look like we're climbing out of this hole.
144	44 149 4 69 35 123 113 37 78 53 144	Can't believe I was let go after 3 years with the company.
144	134 133 174 13 55 122 22 66 40 38 144	Nobody showed up. Typical.
144	117 77 119 138 20 121 48 100 93 1 144	Is this a cry for help?  Seems like a depressing title for a book.
144	7 184 20 169 31 107 165 175 116 87 144	This guy is doomed to a failed marriage
144	206 166 46 97 96 59 52 31 85 113 144	stressful, gloomy, boring
144	201 187 184 193 170 175 56 116 97 145 144	You can buy a house here once, and spend the rest of your life watching sunsets and sunrises
144	118 184 19 135 91 211 35 33 6 39 144	i feel he is referesentative to poor people
144	104 79 32 83 100 167 204 215 122 193 144	Another city with no trees-so depressing.
144	149 57 86 92 181 33 55 213 40 115 144	This sign was made by a bad man.
144	131 181 168 136 163 96 199 42 27 78 144	This man may die from playing so hard.
144	122 84 19 159 27 205 8 191 139 165 144	I wish I had someone to share this view with instead of sitting up here alone.
144	127 92 40 53 124 20 2 58 152 145 144	a bright but morbid colour in my opinion
144	184 130 3 72 182 187 170 6 183 159 144	I have a skirt this color and I hate it.
144	119 177 108 200 75 57 185 38 78 180 144	typical geeky boy trying to impress the girl... it will never work
144	28 108 13 193 196 86 178 51 111 123 144	The snow just keeps coming, hampering travel and business in our already struggling economy.
144	126 166 20 44 152 109 184 89 15 85 144	This reminds me of death.
144	121 20 186 25 5 62 192 55 176 171 144	There are dead bodies under that pile.
144	97 4 46 60 25 138 12 100 103 93 144	It looks like the clouds are rolling in on another beach day.
144	16 116 88 50 24 191 134 45 139 109 144	It's not happy for everyone, some people have no home today.
144	86 42 53 191 112 52 46 120 74 136 144	I bet many people drown here.
144	154 43 86 25 35 71 112 40 169 185 144	I bet a huge storm is coming
144	64 34 15 189 138 128 213 161 130 170 144	Where does it end?
144	29 209 119 73 5 47 206 120 80 196 144	How long did this take?
144	156 62 76 176 50 13 169 214 208 198 144	Ugh she lived a long great life
144	10 159 6 179 19 126 116 180 55 107 144	No hope in this vast emptiness.
144	25 190 85 104 89 157 189 215 109 15 144	This car wont last much longer.
144	89 148 78 189 210 40 58 82 136 27 144	would you look at those clouds, they make me gloomy
144	160 54 180 140 151 170 194 106 75 45 144	they all were busy inside no one wanted to play

146	197 63 172 193 104 99 107 68 169 88 146	The artistic inspiration is amazing in this photo. Look at the colour of the trees, the blue of the sky. The yellow of the road.
146	116 172 70 62 51 203 160 71 125 173 146	Old is beauty sometimes.
146	88 127 1 161 89 31 44 37 108 155 146	I bet he will play a great song

146	184 127 80 92 25 67 131 142 138 27 146	The gilded accents of this original are astounding.
146	132 145 141 6 155 208 34 200 149 211 146	A room like this is an example of modern art.
146	2 24 152 123 69 142 193 82 195 99 146	The color scheme is so soothing. The contrast of the white against the red and the way that the grey is almost pixelated. It draws your eyes immediately up and then left. I greatly enjoy it.
146	72 41 171 194 129 75 157 33 56 86 146	What a great shot

146	123 93 121 175 192 4 209 201 187 177 146	Wow, this island looks like a bird holding a flower in it's mouth. So creative!
146	45 84 157 37 118 116 36 87 204 185 146	The lime green lighting makes me think of the time I spent in Paris.
146	113 29 155 91 112 2 126 133 185 59 146	I would hang that in my house, except then I would have to remove it from nature.
146	160 67 128 124 182 14 82 205 75 154 146	We could charge people for access to their own banana tree.
146	20 192 139 212 70 102 207 6 10 89 146	Planting these trees will one day create a beautiful landscape as far as the eye can see.

146	133 208 194 30 21 90 180 37 126 101 146	Showroom of the design
146	135 127 160 71 86 114 40 111 174 57 146	The design of that building is so beautiful.  I just love the triangle pattern.
146	79 109 145 117 96 56 181 54 13 67 146	The warm summer garden beckons to the passerby, full of life and vibrant.
146	166 47 188 170 144 56 130 45 117 10 146	So stand there, i am going to paint you, 3 hours, go.

146	143 39 170 28 65 160 173 58 71 200 146	I love that there is singular bronze plate it really makes the color of the rest of the collection stand out.
146	125 143 22 46 179 152 112 184 158 29 146	Beautiful artwork in digital signa
146	89 21 185 189 50 125 206 14 42 118 146	I can feel the loss on this woman's face. She has no idea where to go.

146	24 78 83 70 31 132 66 84 45 177 146	An alernative to belts and bras.  A piece of plastic and a groping man
146	67 58 117 211 197 85 175 96 82 31 146	A motor so finely tuned is a product of skilled artisans, not merely wheels on a road.
146	5 62 83 96 79 20 136 149 103 182 146	we dont see any art
146	213 187 77 120 45 51 9 176 137 62 146	This was built by some great artists!
146	44 47 63 53 116 119 36 75 2 185 146	This would be a great scene in a movie.
146	195 110 26 208 75 191 118 60 43 188 146	The bright primary colors on the parachute are so engaging and attractive for children!

146	195 36 54 121 111 78 29 142 63 188 146	This would look nice as a poster on my wall
146	16 17 98 6 83 162 68 133 185 103 146	Dark light in the dark
146	212 195 149 13 58 130 10 100 165 4 146	What a wonderful representation of commonality and youthfulness.

146	73 180 71 84 2 119 54 203 102 50 146	The contrast of the red uniforms with all the greenery in the photo makes for an interesting composition.
146	143 188 41 203 24 134 2 81 55 187 146	I want to paint this
146	148 169 22 31 87 17 46 62 86 185 146	What a brilliant combination of colors that are making that sky so beautiful.
146	156 101 110 84 93 50 20 24 105 133 146	I used the food network to create this dish
146	35 171 175 145 85 126 198 88 191 155 146	The cat looks like he's about to recite some poetry.
146	69 108 47 192 44 134 162 190 20 160 146	the building is artful
146	83 82 194 190 79 29 87 3 44 7 146	The white plumage of the birds makes such a beautiful contrast to the green field.

146	171 149 181 200 65 82 110 108 180 166 146	this looks a painting
146	147 191 26 205 23 105 106 90 121 4 146	The representation of death and life in stone.
146	78 111 47 188 121 196 155 190 11 137 146	not sure what this about other than the back of awomans being kind of arty
146	12 210 176 57 75 95 195 153 211 3 146	A scene reminiscent of a Tuscan village.
146	116 140 55 135 48 92 202 110 215 89 146	This angles at which this hits the focal point is unique.
146	104 47 24 88 81 25 133 60 188 128 146	I love the architecture of some of these buildings
146	195 197 200 39 15 170 3 36 72 93 146	Father and daughter enjoying a beautiful meal together.
146	212 105 100 137 127 69 178 117 40 47 146	This photo colorized would make a statement.
146	49 48 174 136 14 160 116 132 162 199 146	hE SKETCHES REALLY WELL.
146	20 70 170 123 96 72 159 29 28 177 146	Hopefully they're playing a sonata
146	112 88 116 149 96 104 36 67 87 35 146	The soothing sight of a peaceful, windswept sea.
146	77 110 16 7 40 17 61 44 49 102 146	I really love the shading
146	133 214 205 128 195 1 215 99 191 89 146	I want to add my own spin to that collection
146	34 62 160 12 201 150 33 44 183 163 146	You can really tell this couple is in love the way this woman closes her eye gently and tilts her head back as she anticipates a soft kiss from this scruffy man.
146	132 213 103 161 60 151 172 67 209 185 146	Such great culture in this
147	161 182 65 99 115 54 117 25 172 138 147	I want to go somewhere else other than here! This is not what I signed up for.
147	14 89 12 124 2 179 122 130 87 45 147	His hat is beautiful; I think it's made from a goat.
147	111 15 128 43 92 32 110 98 6 71 147	those abs look fake
147	15 14 113 187 184 96 76 112 143 131 147	this is disturbing
147	36 35 37 65 153 116 149 141 152 175 147	This is awful to ride offroad
147	31 167 211 90 49 188 151 141 67 113 147	The man is making an aweful smile
147	180 135 52 197 206 185 14 7 182 212 147	That building is going to collapse!!!
147	3 22 58 88 196 190 159 215 64 173 147	I can't believe no fans as it is hot.
147	151 103 78 50 204 172 1 80 67 5 147	It is comical to think that he needs poles to walk
147	115 65 47 132 75 70 28 41 190 140 147	All gold everything as they say.
147	198 178 7 164 109 120 72 128 47 103 147	I want to stick those bananas into my ears!
147	74 153 44 195 211 206 157 145 30 2 147	I want to shrink down and ride that tiny bike.
147	197 104 198 115 45 141 103 148 25 24 147	This traffic makes me want to die.
147	26 186 198 54 211 30 146 194 212 182 147	Is that a booger in a person's nose?
147	29 38 72 179 141 196 169 3 207 181 147	Ha Ha, that is so crazy.  It's like hair sticking out of the ground in big clumps.
147	10 15 167 171 65 206 149 37 130 19 147	How annoying how that pillar is blocking everything
147	205 171 65 51 168 98 134 128 36 122 147	The shadow of that tree reminds me of my veins during my drug addicted years.
147	121 93 91 43 67 53 46 131 139 32 147	For his next stunt, the driver will jump the mountain in the background
147	131 44 167 12 88 61 169 151 21 145 147	A laughable looking sheep
147	186 3 98 164 120 72 152 110 95 141 147	Why is she even sitting in the shade to read?
147	195 212 22 187 113 157 23 34 5 42 147	The list of six words and phrases is really the cipher to an international book of codes.
147	87 14 180 166 209 17 50 197 120 171 147	I think these people are trying to convince the wall they are not a threat.
147	35 193 135 84 214 158 194 54 10 133 147	It kind of looks like a tent
147	164 173 150 134 104 26 40 118 66 158 147	I should race marbles down this hill!
147	69 61 56 108 190 126 59 77 135 195 147	One day I will own even more land than you see in this picture.  I will own thousands of acres.  I will have my own town.
147	33 116 204 110 42 34 11 12 141 88 147	I wonder if they also sold the animal inside the tank.
147	156 169 113 210 206 35 144 180 94 155 147	She should not drink that.
147	208 24 7 169 51 55 22 90 63 35 147	I enjoy taking handfuls of these and just HURLING them at passing cars.
147	99 213 42 56 192 140 134 10 69 179 147	This sundial is better off for a doorstop.
147	78 76 122 169 145 165 63 41 43 67 147	This is not my favorite site at all.
147	208 11 94 77 105 96 68 195 3 16 147	They should not be walking in that weather!
147	215 6 90 29 35 116 110 123 95 199 147	The lunge is too far
147	139 84 172 207 178 50 113 164 184 34 147	This is so unsafe, what if there are sharks in the water?
147	191 99 172 31 30 201 194 130 214 26 147	The boy is the oldest, he's about 95.
147	74 167 97 68 69 113 3 86 160 143 147	I bet I could make a fortune off of these petals.
147	204 46 103 36 162 26 25 153 34 56 147	The sun will melt her skin off!
147	158 22 106 70 191 46 213 211 29 27 147	This is my favorite movie, green slime.

147	26 123 23 51 215 65 120 4 102 59 147	If he is down there, who is driving the boat?
147	214 143 119 104 79 29 52 137 100 18 147	You can totally see his bootie.
147	148 79 12 117 80 66 87 56 27 85 147	Look out! That tree is going to slap your building!
147	82 11 66 177 12 112 24 63 182 71 147	Does that window roll down?
147	207 199 36 194 70 59 133 91 14 167 147	I want to replace my head with one of these mannequins!
147	126 115 179 192 116 186 205 100 113 170 147	Hey guys what's up just commenting on this great picture I just found of a cat
147	180 184 125 25 18 178 44 87 197 98 147	I would pay that man $1,000,000 to let me ride in his basket.
147	44 119 26 1 137 90 150 115 132 207 147	It would be magical if all the buildings could be painted purple and orange. They could be used to house orphan hamsters.
147	154 75 39 100 112 87 115 175 177 41 147	Hockey is way too violent and should be made illegal immediately to prevent our children from getting brain damage and skater's toe.
147	170 12 23 148 118 152 69 177 93 204 147	Awfully lot of colors, maybe it needs some more
148	134 173 47 1 131 111 31 100 55 156 148	What nice peaks and design.
148	113 99 199 125 90 62 166 165 160 38 148	What a dull day at the beach, way too many people for my liking.
148	206 85 48 26 43 197 78 196 207 47 148	I've been to this city many times.
148	210 28 97 171 149 150 126 179 138 190 148	This was the most uneventful game.
148	91 36 147 44 53 103 196 105 212 204 148	Why go so far out? I doubt its any better than where we already are.
148	138 210 37 127 212 184 152 80 15 58 148	this makes me miss Christmas!
148	12 123 76 193 42 177 150 20 136 26 148	I miss you so much! You use to always be around for my gloomy days.
148	209 78 121 60 12 1 174 74 152 71 148	I used to love this show!
148	110 170 96 50 166 48 87 61 158 100 148	I dont like where i am
148	99 87 109 93 20 161 179 144 43 127 148	seeing all the trees is serine
148	176 149 150 109 111 51 186 190 81 45 148	poor, oddly shaped tomato.
148	164 118 196 53 10 185 122 76 205 32 148	This area was so amazing!
148	29 174 56 20 16 72 12 204 136 82 148	I remember coming here. Its so breathtaking.
148	36 20 186 206 138 122 51 166 95 102 148	People have so many addictions.
148	163 190 104 185 126 213 107 165 67 102 148	Kids don't have childhoods anymore.
148	18 87 206 13 8 52 117 80 132 53 148	Looks liek a sad rainy day
148	135 13 58 86 57 114 187 179 63 175 148	the words written on that paper will bring a a saddened mood to all who see it
148	80 33 138 65 104 152 76 3 95 64 148	Seeing how many people are at this site makes me moody
148	133 37 209 15 203 21 9 194 172 156 148	Looks like my grandma's house before she died.
148	168 114 31 29 69 171 173 177 124 85 148	I wish I had friends to take selfies with me.
148	158 62 166 9 69 53 112 142 64 151 148	Too bad the entire family couldn't come.
148	32 89 61 95 213 69 122 156 70 188 148	Not sure how to feel about this.
148	191 151 3 176 128 126 52 215 20 41 148	I don't feel like climbing these stairs.
148	161 99 182 113 83 215 17 64 10 162 148	This makes me think of home...
148	203 112 89 105 72 215 127 67 200 156 148	This was the best trip ever.
148	86 184 15 115 4 135 205 152 103 66 148	I miss playing basketball!
148	150 109 117 141 209 160 191 213 30 163 148	Stuck in a box, with an imitation of life inside. This mirrors the human condition, only our barriers to freedom are figurative.
148	112 68 55 93 95 144 33 127 78 197 148	What a sad and lonely street.
148	101 9 210 163 126 211 109 120 137 172 148	I'm sad that I'll never get to visit here again.
148	215 80 140 87 92 117 11 62 212 13 148	I love little shops like this. It really reminds me of similar shops that were in my neighborhood when I was growing up.
148	173 45 29 51 68 35 157 91 63 80 148	This guy seems to be just as depressed as I am.
148	169 23 173 27 121 76 188 53 48 107 148	We're not really getting in that. It's just good pictures to pick up women with!
148	45 68 25 71 13 118 106 131 75 111 148	This day got worse for me: now it's going to rain.
148	70 35 30 124 23 114 213 65 45 8 148	Imagine getting killed by a dog and seeing this as your last sight.
148	145 55 136 90 94 14 125 69 26 93 148	Coming in last in the race really damaged my confidence for the next race.
148	26 140 128 172 17 166 160 44 136 122 148	It's depressing that people have to demonstrate against the most basic things.
148	90 48 9 179 87 187 181 161 166 127 148	I already thought the color brown was dull, but this is a new level of blah.
148	101 196 131 169 89 137 118 185 44 99 148	The gently swaying plants slowly dispersed their seeds as if they are morning the passage of time.
148	17 85 109 215 177 26 206 197 16 142 148	Although all the woman were here we really missed having the men
148	208 146 209 90 192 83 180 52 200 93 148	She looks all alone.
148	58 155 191 182 149 211 140 78 14 54 148	farm and work
148	2 64 41 48 198 104 71 62 69 25 148	these flowers bring me to happiness
148	189 37 144 165 162 105 21 183 10 4 148	Yep, that's a statue of a cross with Jesus on it.
148	159 145 168 178 72 49 138 10 185 99 148	It's sad that these monkeys numbers within in the wild are dwindling so rapidly.
148	200 193 66 112 92 108 64 126 153 80 148	Those people  looks ridiculously happy.
148	22 188 135 71 21 87 172 174 192 68 148	It was sad to visit the food stand after the previous owner passed away.
148	153 43 129 138 76 206 60 169 57 30 148	I've lost a thousand keys in my lifetime.
148	56 24 164 72 196 179 187 120 159 96 148	The bitter truth of a flower is, it will be plucked!
148	215 182 156 15 43 16 17 36 7 69 148	That lady is so old it's kind of depressing.
148	175 103 100 215 61 50 114 186 193 88 148	The grey clouds make be feel sad as they drape behind this old church.
148	204 71 164 102 149 68 55 31 182 52 148	It looks like a sad day outside.
148	52 206 92 96 60 1 80 114 20 211 148	Went there with my ex
148	135 155 99 139 107 206 80 41 176 191 148	Its so empty
148	14 108 145 127 208 206 199 130 161 167 148	Wish I was doing that rather than being stuck in an office!
148	40 126 93 64 132 24 154 94 16 194 148	Reminds me of my honeymoon !
148	37 56 129 81 183 117 164 144 171 105 148	Something about this picture truly relaxes me to my core.
148	164 198 44 42 94 18 167 158 195 133 148	This looks so boring.
148	190 105 84 106 2 33 1 96 175 14 148	If the Smashing Pumpkins were a physical location instead of a band, it would be here.
148	178 92 98 86 146 9 71 127 173 7 148	This reminds me of Fried Green Tomatoes. I miss simpler times, clean food, less crime, less ugliness in the world.
148	176 63 179 48 153 81 135 167 90 52 148	He's smiling I think, but what a sad bar to be smiling in.
148	199 42 203 30 38 144 153 189 140 143 148	This benches are kind of pretty. I can't wait to sit on them alone forever.
148	151 118 186 205 42 212 200 38 31 141 148	Live music is depressing.
148	48 196 130 152 145 79 119 95 124 161 148	he was a great man.
148	31 25 89 106 167 173 195 110 74 29 148	She has no idea what she's walking into.
148	97 96 72 195 175 145 54 86 74 27 148	"I must go down to the sea again, the wind the sea and the sky, where all I ask is a tall ship, and a star to steer her by." John Masefield, 'Sea Fever'
148	108 64 32 70 205 167 128 65 13 1 148	Gone are the days of Yore where we lived off the land.
148	46 31 7 58 52 35 120 5 182 43 148	It is sad what this statue represents.
148	82 170 187 70 135 51 162 165 144 73 148	They look like my brother and I. I really do miss him.
148	19 87 150 51 204 131 121 146 182 101 148	It's sad knowing he is now in a coma.
148	21 189 30 199 95 53 104 150 206 165 148	Who cares about that parking space up front?
148	189 127 126 43 17 149 22 91 140 71 148	We have to fight and protest for everything.
148	141 26 19 156 197 212 75 17 55 199 148	Nightfall will come soon, and it's hard to appreciate the fleeting beauty of this, or any, photo.
148	175 205 199 183 34 179 13 105 62 15 148	This is pretty
148	195 133 211 37 132 113 3 162 27 152 148	The water has risen, unlike our the property value.
148	173 102 150 52 139 187 19 79 158 202 148	It's just as run down as that food makes people feel.
148	57 131 110 22 190 96 201 41 17 19 148	I would enjoy this beautiful place more if I wasn't so cold and miserable.
148	66 101 59 155 110 29 174 190 34 27 148	Korn reminds me of when I was a teenager, it was the best time of my life and I can't even afford these tickets.
148	15 200 131 201 44 214 160 142 46 11 148	I wish I had peace in my heart like the peace in the nature of this picture has.
148	186 22 205 54 207 167 150 177 129 4 148	This reminds me of singing after dinner with my late father, I miss him.
148	70 146 108 38 32 42 134 161 99 136 148	I'm sure the food there is not good.
148	55 123 149 75 70 215 95 102 195 18 148	This was the last photo before his suicide. So sad.
148	160 118 65 104 68 52 91 123 99 47 148	This statue is beauty.
148	56 142 108 156 35 122 186 11 149 151 148	Flowers flow and fly around us all.
148	26 23 67 178 44 43 185 114 28 177 148	What a bleak, overcast day
148	152 113 143 26 63 158 17 76 205 85 148	can on a pole?
148	22 162 41 183 210 24 46 212 135 45 148	rehersing the new dance moves?
148	50 96 189 95 36 23 61 67 213 135 148	I remember when I used to love photos like this.
148	89 137 116 142 81 145 190 215 172 134 148	I remember when I used to enjoy the taste of food.
148	192 96 118 8 45 84 87 13 111 139 148	I remember my summe vacation, all the buses I had to take, great memories.
148	140 58 5 101 48 152 146 90 9 46 148	I once had a little kid like this,
148	14 188 209 183 135 21 85 140 169 213 148	He looks like my dad. I miss dad.
148	65 95 111 174 194 128 20 160 29 145 148	This was the last day I remember before the war ravaged our lands.
148	2 48 155 25 64 205 161 132 108 11 148	The clouds everywhere mean it will rain, and we will get soaked getting to our car.
148	70 77 8 33 183 3 200 40 82 146 148	These guys look like they just want to go home and go to sleep.
148	14 178 17 2 126 141 62 29 170 61 148	Another day by the bridge, another day wasted.
148	15 28 144 108 62 141 119 189 118 136 148	This view is very tranquil and peaceful.
148	135 185 122 182 7 54 55 126 125 153 148	Those kinds of color are depressing to watch, that so called painting could be improved.
148	52 62 100 167 105 171 212 74 128 122 148	So few places left that are this wild...
148	118 85 133 129 121 91 184 125 18 132 148	I bet this guy feels almost as lonely as me...
148	137 156 191 195 108 11 69 204 9 138 148	These two might break up by the end of the game, how sad.
148	62 213 27 36 77 4 191 16 75 194 148	reminds me of my dead mother
148	5 212 84 124 189 118 25 78 79 61 148	One time I slipped on snow like that and broke my arm.
148	201 168 69 104 95 70 153 115 83 156 148	My dad would have loved this song.
148	121 124 110 66 71 164 17 207 9 10 148	The bitter truth is world is leaving the importance of riding bicycles to protect our health and ecosystem.
148	104 203 156 145 86 94 80 1 6 147 148	Another boring picture looking at cars.
148	54 169 175 117 98 149 107 85 157 142 148	I am so sad looking at this girl.
148	71 215 202 191 165 125 95 211 173 190 148	Their dancing makes me sad.
148	87 127 156 51 80 117 20 121 170 143 148	I'm sad that I can't sing like them.
148	111 5 103 119 120 93 113 21 74 203 148	Oh, another debate, will these ever end?
148	24 192 1 71 182 185 7 53 158 131 148	I wonder what these two are thinking about and if they are happy and have had a good month.
148	188 24 127 39 121 16 87 176 205 107 148	This music is very depressing.
148	7 69 1 112 83 21 56 64 196 150 148	Listening to the future is depressing.
148	175 101 110 138 135 130 109 12 53 30 148	My sister died two years ago.
148	68 214 117 22 177 215 110 78 167 61 148	The gentle swooping of the typography reminds me of a weeping willow, bending in the wind.
148	168 73 94 150 41 77 178 66 124 154 148	I feel sad for that sick girl.
148	38 81 52 152 173 94 28 136 125 134 148	This act makes me sad.
148	30 98 43 208 49 152 167 22 59 106 148	So unoriginal, two guys drinking beer.
148	163 126 143 73 115 149 170 13 55 166 148	The moss is very appealing
148	10 164 23 52 155 213 48 76 211 97 148	Another day in the hot sun with beers and glasses and friends. Hopefully this vacation will be over.
148	34 81 46 157 149 140 30 167 10 53 148	She's smiling now, but when he's crying and won't stop she'll be just as sad as I always am...
148	11 67 80 127 89 207 211 154 161 160 148	Oh, if only I had friends like those.
148	195 97 185 149 172 209 176 47 146 194 148	This building makes me sad.
148	199 196 85 13 113 195 163 57 200 107 148	There are so few of us left to march.
148	165 209 144 173 94 132 31 78 116 205 148	I hope that they allow the horse to rest adequately sometimes they are overworked.
148	186 139 122 169 88 107 60 125 18 142 148	I miss the old ways.
148	90 75 213 122 133 137 15 202 123 215 148	I wonder what deep things they are doing.
148	124 27 66 105 88 28 52 60 114 24 148	I wish I still had a horse, mine died years ago.
148	35 14 44 163 191 128 6 138 57 112 148	This fish is taking his last breath because he is dying from depression
148	113 129 105 189 140 137 100 34 211 57 148	I remember that elephant! my mom had exactly the same when we were young!
148	43 172 90 88 213 61 6 29 3 76 148	its common use to everyone life
148	211 84 55 97 48 161 77 208 205 56 148	Cute folds to play with
148	177 138 17 59 174 94 126 121 202 215 148	This stripped down vehicle reminds me of how empty I am inside
148	78 9 101 82 87 41 177 169 14 195 148	I guess this is cool
148	191 132 42 91 146 57 80 34 149 189 148	Just another example of Victorian architecture.
148	198 142 182 39 87 53 92 164 179 5 148	This room is as silent as my heart. This place has never been silent as today.
148	95 100 18 167 144 162 124 138 61 1 148	Why cake? You'll only feel down afterwards.
148	91 130 132 20 117 189 107 175 78 128 148	Even visiting someplace as nice as this, it still makes me sad looking at it.
148	52 62 211 171 58 40 83 200 90 121 148	Oh no! the tigers are losing the game they might never win this season
148	20 172 144 136 18 124 122 121 86 184 148	Digital art has NOTHING on this. Look at the detail, the craftsmanship. I grew up in the wrong century :(
148	46 37 85 186 36 207 26 110 172 113 148	I stand in the cold, by the river's edge, and have only my sad and disconsolate thoughts as company in this dark, overcast world.
148	170 164 154 182 188 99 19 203 10 150 148	All of these people playing and having a great time while I'm not. If only I could experience such splendor
148	33 176 125 136 126 112 198 213 75 45 148	A depressing gathering.
148	114 63 57 189 50 87 166 23 205 195 148	This is such a display of physical excellence.
148	132 30 107 95 18 3 46 125 61 205 148	Day after day we have to stand in another line for something probably not even worth it.
148	29 19 60 163 95 215 193 61 177 118 148	The horses remind me of Shadowfax, my late horse from childhood.
148	193 84 62 151 93 212 14 37 100 172 148	Do they see what is behind their heads? I hope it's not a bad sign.
148	152 35 91 142 41 140 94 107 98 73 148	A soon to be ad space building.
148	34 44 147 24 17 63 214 28 100 202 148	I never fell lonelier than when I see perfect pairs like salt and pepper.
148	4 1 41 184 73 132 91 203 164 13 148	Will this rain ever end?  It's so dreary...
148	147 11 6 197 100 60 92 119 8 37 148	Why do they have to put so much weight on that mule?
148	49 20 189 15 125 161 72 114 96 74 148	too many flights these days.
148	82 200 52 70 202 145 193 33 135 181 148	They're beautiful pieces, but they'll probably be painted over soon, gone forever.
148	90 129 100 110 146 94 2 167 32 131 148	This restaurant makes me sad.
148	91 165 23 207 33 180 127 58 4 190 148	This place depicts a lot of sadness,does not look lively
148	51 3 74 42 203 123 43 97 134 4 148	This painting makes me sad.
148	68 25 93 126 169 67 146 170 29 140 148	That pig is probably starving trying to eat sand.
148	126 96 11 5 174 53 67 142 89 159 148	What a sad looking building.
148	112 161 39 75 101 15 72 182 184 147 148	That is so sad looking
148	24 134 32 44 71 99 156 131 111 75 148	This books makes me lose hope in humans.
148	92 70 179 48 153 180 26 152 182 18 148	This is quite relaxing
148	69 58 182 1 33 137 129 214 100 85 148	Likely listening to sad songs alone.
148	149 71 172 178 166 72 14 160 43 22 148	That child would rather be with their mother.
148	88 167 166 181 83 90 169 126 80 127 148	Dreary day for a dreary picture.
148	173 121 156 73 105 107 101 76 142 51 148	the squares are in perfect rows unlike the trees
148	171 178 6 147 111 22 118 161 198 125 148	Wy can't we go back to the simpler days?
148	208 79 197 42 213 168 163 165 102 214 148	Sadly,this might be the last time these two ever meet agin.
148	79 109 170 118 21 136 72 102 188 6 148	Man they are so tiny compared to that mountain.
148	36 17 69 190 94 19 35 163 178 150 148	Why do you look so alone?
148	11 136 124 26 189 14 149 65 57 137 148	The arc makes me sad and lonely because I'm reminded of my ex boyfriend.
148	122 65 99 58 121 132 71 154 46 68 148	This color can sometimes make me sad at times.
148	118 127 67 128 42 190 74 129 211 59 148	I love playing in the snow
148	93 114 128 10 104 171 63 27 176 137 148	Weeds are growing inside of the house. Story of my life.
148	81 131 179 195 45 94 123 183 100 103 148	That door looks exactly how I feel.
148	105 186 210 116 30 77 50 35 208 16 148	Too bright for me
148	170 205 128 111 94 151 183 156 131 36 148	The plants did not turn out as healthy as they were anticipated to be.
148	7 150 19 132 162 36 189 17 101 81 148	This reminds me of a scene in Disney Channel.
148	108 48 63 150 198 102 194 110 187 33 148	I miss you sis, RIP
148	206 14 199 177 40 51 62 105 103 110 148	I have that jacket
148	195 61 88 210 105 14 158 211 189 80 148	I wish I could just go and live in some green woods like that.
148	20 122 55 40 133 58 63 35 44 179 148	it's a vacate street
148	8 208 205 98 55 44 99 84 50 193 148	I had two vacations under palapas like these with the woman that should have been my wife.
148	205 80 120 133 128 114 61 63 157 112 148	What a sad thing so see so much litter.
148	133 31 19 57 169 34 88 90 189 198 148	Life is like this guy's suit, dark and meaningless ...
148	149 181 61 167 109 51 162 91 75 110 148	Will there ever be peace in this crazy world?
148	87 140 146 114 2 28 162 109 93 124 148	Is this it?
148	190 40 16 86 194 204 61 198 18 112 148	This was the last light that my father worked on before his death
148	30 23 104 146 64 16 91 136 107 98 148	Sunsets remind me of happier times gone by.
148	52 76 164 209 8 178 55 108 162 85 148	Too bad the man in the middle wasn't still alive.
149	184 173 181 2 29 123 105 101 85 179 149	These sketches look like they're inspired by the government.
149	151 177 186 121 138 192 5 104 106 154 149	This city wouldn't withstand a rainstorm.
149	126 83 143 12 5 89 80 158 197 25 149	This is the kind of postcard you'll see but, in person, I doubt it will be that beautiful.  Probably some lame tour that doesn't even give you that view.
149	122 60 151 46 198 195 40 181 139 57 149	How much longer than this little kid pull my suitcase?
149	75 112 107 181 157 155 154 84 5 92 149	That cat might freeze to death.
149	143 158 108 89 30 70 131 45 104 170 149	Graffiti is not a type of art and it makes things look ugly.
149	48 40 118 138 57 111 15 141 53 168 149	He probably won't get braces, but he needs them.
149	10 19 82 141 183 185 4 71 215 137 149	Im sure they cant bowl
149	60 77 176 80 29 163 98 165 115 93 149	You won't last long in the real world. You'll wish you were still in school.
149	38 65 107 48 108 86 92 126 80 172 149	Does anyone actually live there?
149	199 160 193 11 21 48 49 63 110 164 149	Birds will not see any of that seed...
149	123 35 17 103 126 58 77 181 6 114 149	This is fake.
149	134 205 18 165 1 114 60 159 196 119 149	I'm not sure I would be able to ride one of these canoes.
149	194 123 133 52 137 39 119 178 92 173 149	That bird will hit the pole
149	115 94 146 180 102 190 197 32 43 192 149	That does not look like a fun place to be...
149	14 170 35 107 212 133 128 192 47 193 149	Her facial expression seems to me that shes hiding something...
149	215 117 176 76 48 197 43 53 3 114 149	That's just a blue screen, right?
149	213 162 49 3 188 24 145 115 35 11 149	This looks badly photoshopped to me.
149	143 77 27 75 186 193 69 12 93 22 149	It is doubtful that they are having fun
149	124 27 134 212 86 201 19 173 190 17 149	Did you really take this picture? seems too good for you.
149	103 20 136 195 84 34 105 154 61 148 149	Is that even a real butterfly?
149	59 134 138 191 5 176 8 177 91 155 149	I bet this door goes to some dirty water. Before we know it this whole lake will be covered in trash.
149	153 161 108 134 55 107 133 44 167 80 149	I doubt that dog is having a good time.
149	13 127 175 155 60 105 62 14 42 21 149	I don't think these two will last.
149	214 10 138 211 170 86 207 194 39 5 149	I doubt that car is very efficient.
149	197 184 198 206 101 105 72 94 95 66 149	i doubt these people are having any fun at all
149	183 67 119 125 210 13 33 160 10 118 149	This background is photoshoped
149	23 118 152 159 144 182 104 209 175 171 149	this cat definitely cannot be trusted
149	59 171 155 162 176 87 48 156 190 58 149	Not much to see here
149	142 208 131 145 67 128 129 17 30 90 149	Almost a whole inch in less than two weeks? Yeah right.
149	109 183 6 87 82 52 17 152 92 114 149	That bird looks like it is disease ridden, I would stay away from it
149	33 111 182 47 128 168 148 205 125 137 149	I doubt if the lady with the pram will give way to that man
149	98 67 127 182 88 62 13 74 68 132 149	Would those tents hold up in a storm?
149	84 71 203 189 140 114 162 185 73 208 149	I see a starless cityscape like this, and wonder if our society was just a failed experiment by the gods.
149	205 86 159 4 95 111 80 5 46 145 149	I bet he actually lost.
149	151 98 158 128 115 29 148 57 178 66 149	I never trust sales. It's just a store's way of getting rid of garbage.
149	27 183 195 37 2 57 45 44 102 46 149	What a dark, disdainful mood for a show.
149	195 138 6 95 134 73 209 150 148 2 149	are those trees?
149	173 81 55 15 57 9 196 5 69 148 149	Those emus are going to end up with an Ibex horn through them, if the owner insists they cohabit.
149	51 168 56 30 13 97 53 186 64 195 149	I would be skeptical getting on the train
149	124 58 202 114 27 96 187 142 94 161 149	I'm sure it pooped on her dress.
149	142 2 87 61 133 144 150 146 194 106 149	That girl looks sketchy
149	84 119 12 82 117 135 163 106 196 29 149	That plant must be fake
149	31 167 69 182 32 106 59 98 23 114 149	Looks a little bright to be a night club...
149	94 55 108 144 215 27 93 199 151 41 149	I doubt she is the type of person to hold the door open for others.
149	31 20 51 122 1 4 98 99 173 18 149	I don't think these people are getting their way.
149	184 81 160 203 57 193 5 108 173 196 149	I don't think this plane will  go to space.
149	79 203 54 72 37 63 190 58 138 106 149	This looks good as a picture but Id be willing to bet he wasn't able to score from this position.
149	145 133 21 203 187 9 121 174 114 155 149	I don't think they will be able to make the finals although they are doing well.
149	42 78 185 70 171 180 169 10 136 5 149	This place looks like it will collapse at any minute.
149	209 200 63 20 213 132 9 107 152 158 149	The image looks good, but I somehow doubt the music is any good. This band looks like they're just learning to play!
149	15 11 69 48 114 104 153 24 17 9 149	I don't believe it is time to be swimming yet...
149	125 196 139 81 172 212 171 158 32 191 149	I don't think this makes a great shetler
149	107 3 185 191 61 174 88 187 21 13 149	I wonder why the boats are out there.
149	26 109 146 191 112 211 24 193 90 160 149	I don't think that this baby will grow up to be the president or anything alike.
149	98 25 118 140 160 158 53 4 156 113 149	I don't think they uploaded the correct picture.
149	18 113 4 204 130 202 70 125 66 75 149	I really wonder about this place! is it situated in CA?
149	124 156 100 211 106 37 48 31 213 214 149	The talisman bus line is attempting to undersell Greyhound. Good luck with that!
149	204 126 64 62 14 47 186 24 79 46 149	What did they guys get themselves into?
149	51 201 210 18 87 58 128 174 78 131 149	Looks like he's expecting a "no" shortly.
149	123 65 131 83 89 23 55 42 69 166 149	Does this statue even have a purpose
149	194 142 122 42 38 8 19 167 17 98 149	She probably can't sing all that well.
149	142 89 176 208 175 179 21 11 18 5 149	I dont know, theres alot of people there, I may get pick pocketed.
149	159 145 93 89 131 28 29 193 73 17 149	This car probably isn't going that fast, the camera shutter speed is just slow
149	134 116 41 158 25 27 119 150 53 20 149	I don't think any of those ladies are interested in that guy.
149	165 184 86 181 191 42 205 78 158 43 149	Those tires will last long.
149	97 102 109 150 27 191 184 177 81 75 149	I doubt that's going to clear up on it's own.
149	37 140 94 20 195 163 101 174 11 60 149	Probably not as deep as it looks - all about perspective.
149	82 107 90 21 205 109 145 72 197 201 149	festivals such as hallowen are sometimes dangerous as we can not know whom the person is infront of us , so one should take care when attend such kind of festivals where faces are covered with mask
149	147 130 3 210 128 50 61 36 193 73 149	That car doesn't go fast.
149	173 51 43 75 121 26 197 42 147 117 149	I doubt that flower will last all day.
149	196 52 14 205 16 60 144 101 171 90 149	That place doesn't look very popular.
149	140 176 104 174 72 54 203 89 139 87 149	Wow what a beautiful dance
149	50 168 150 193 144 128 166 184 12 46 149	this is probable the last flower of the season
149	178 84 74 159 215 131 130 207 128 15 149	These kids look like they move slow
149	86 120 138 182 111 46 40 164 201 6 149	Looks like someone left this animal alone.
149	65 34 129 140 150 211 101 89 136 97 149	I doubt these people are having a picnic.
149	21 205 118 105 37 40 38 153 111 151 149	I think this building isn't the hospital.
149	195 47 204 55 203 48 129 162 182 46 149	I doubt that this is made from real material, it is most likely a replica.
149	215 201 153 140 17 55 82 117 68 90 149	I doubt they will land safely.
149	187 212 58 140 101 139 190 91 170 175 149	Hands up don't shoot in every country
149	69 202 63 13 89 143 60 128 173 55 149	I do not think this crown is not worth much of anything.
149	108 73 7 157 211 113 85 195 107 171 149	She said we should climb up the fort to see the view but I said it was too much work.
149	166 173 68 66 177 209 137 96 118 183 149	Fake sports for idiots, good work!
149	20 181 49 186 92 24 214 35 104 13 149	I am not sure what these men are talking about here!
149	26 99 146 196 56 104 144 5 213 193 149	Chopsticks are the most difficult things for me. How do they do it?
149	92 127 140 106 58 172 32 203 105 152 149	I bet a storm is going to roll in at any moment.
149	106 133 103 43 56 57 55 59 10 48 149	Seems a little too posed.
149	180 126 191 197 167 9 35 96 22 185 149	Such hopeful players who are just as likely to go home losers as they could end up going home winners.
149	50 158 93 157 192 212 43 55 48 92 149	This restaurant will fail within a year.
149	51 74 80 194 175 130 45 166 101 73 149	I have a feeling there is a fungus that will kill those trees.
149	96 51 8 20 202 50 161 74 168 31 149	That boy looks like hes trouble
149	65 15 58 121 150 197 163 141 19 148 149	Skaters destroyed this concrete rail... so the city put in a metal rail!? That will still get destroyed!
149	68 160 185 152 97 73 11 80 29 174 149	Did they really do a destination wedding? I see the groom's lei, but the background doesn't look very tropical...
149	126 153 208 179 198 59 64 72 122 95 149	I bet that car is going to lose.
149	161 162 160 107 179 64 109 178 17 114 149	I doubt this is not safe for the washing machine.
149	123 113 69 40 95 65 31 73 188 99 149	I don't think they are friends.
149	162 146 47 88 186 57 45 3 210 9 149	I do not think that was the intended use of the breakfast bowl.
149	146 186 164 8 7 9 172 189 200 87 149	These guys say they're the best hackers on the east coast, but I've never heard of them, and I know all of the hackers.
149	170 125 178 26 64 6 36 173 174 136 149	Sure it's pretty, but it'll be firewood soon
149	147 189 61 154 45 63 66 15 191 7 149	I do not know if they will last as a couple
149	195 83 167 50 76 36 148 11 66 62 149	I think he was so drunk that he managed to misplace the beach
149	157 164 200 92 184 181 14 77 165 22 149	I don't know if they should be standing so close to that machine.
149	20 114 45 100 172 34 187 199 161 185 149	I think that car isn't as fast as it looks.
149	121 111 1 209 160 161 191 23 17 48 149	I doubt they are peaceful people.
149	148 185 28 26 48 4 96 91 79 130 149	i doubt .. is it a cat or a tiger cub
149	68 190 96 204 148 108 193 140 73 60 149	Hmm, I don't think this guy can kayak that much more in the lake.
149	97 152 112 106 58 161 11 192 107 85 149	skeptical scary buildings
149	209 77 85 42 14 84 65 37 4 70 149	I dont believe that they are Japanese
149	174 133 109 34 55 142 32 22 57 107 149	I don't think this woman in the pink realizes the marathon is going in the other direction!
149	21 81 7 160 89 147 187 63 116 179 149	This calf won't make it through the night.
149	109 192 199 75 190 182 63 67 194 112 149	He does not plan on getting in
149	19 142 12 191 206 160 87 43 29 106 149	Hmm. Not sure these guys are going to make much of a diffrence.
149	212 9 188 78 182 35 109 170 24 8 149	I'm not sure what's edible on this plate.
149	100 81 173 58 168 157 185 96 49 18 149	I bet he drops that ball before he scores.
149	196 73 32 143 57 100 7 144 112 106 149	Girls can't play sports as well as men.
149	93 34 178 118 87 38 179 136 110 15 149	He probably doesn't have a job or go to school.
149	48 10 62 126 79 35 105 16 123 73 149	She's trying too hard
149	176 5 110 60 213 141 159 96 94 15 149	Doubt this bug will ever fly.
149	83 135 39 196 184 163 169 208 170 182 149	That's an accident waiting to happen.
149	68 64 205 174 206 71 90 84 173 146 149	hmm i feel like this dog is up to no good
149	108 151 7 196 55 185 22 130 66 99 149	I don't think those speakers look very prepared
149	125 57 85 147 194 100 65 169 132 31 149	I doubt that survives a hurricane.
149	97 191 134 129 111 22 133 82 59 37 149	I'm not sure those are up to par.
149	188 93 7 176 167 19 94 164 58 182 149	This girl is going places but unlikely she will ever want work in the medical profession after wearing this costume.
149	101 196 1 115 108 95 154 189 19 41 149	I doubt he is really in the military.
149	83 214 186 7 129 175 165 91 108 44 149	I'm really not sure if this lady knows what she is talking about
149	111 122 62 28 47 207 79 26 120 58 149	We are probably not going to win.
149	138 214 195 10 145 126 209 116 152 130 149	I dont think they are saving anyone.
149	155 79 186 11 48 125 142 84 26 15 149	Some people may think those clouds are beautiful, but man are they so fake.
149	43 51 148 100 215 9 147 171 133 205 149	I doubt that is something from earth.
149	181 102 158 195 79 14 166 188 72 161 149	I don't think the monkey will be able to do anything special with the logs he was given.
149	136 159 198 70 44 29 61 45 203 182 149	I doubt he likes her.
149	93 130 104 4 17 151 39 29 2 3 149	I doubt I'd be able to glide this plane to the nearest piece of land without any more gas.
149	178 165 152 128 32 111 6 185 100 171 149	As if they would ever have all 13 in operation at once...
149	56 103 35 15 200 119 159 47 179 132 149	I think they are lip singing.
149	95 63 204 181 200 32 67 13 172 119 149	Beautiful sight but how many laborers broke their backs for it?
149	97 144 215 171 190 81 197 137 109 203 149	That is a lot of children piled in one spot I think this may need some additional supervision
149	191 164 2 125 148 132 85 5 45 98 149	I feel like shes going to drop the child
149	95 172 201 80 157 8 70 120 156 47 149	That doesn't look like purple to me
149	185 55 160 111 99 74 147 78 204 32 149	I don't think your wish is going to come true...
149	135 162 130 195 83 174 51 96 17 11 149	I don't really think you took this photo.
149	40 56 135 20 75 38 55 82 175 167 149	I doubt this run ended in anthing but a fumble.
149	133 100 112 208 131 42 116 31 202 46 149	These kinds of conferences never give much good information.
149	59 106 173 100 190 81 124 18 21 92 149	I doubt they live there.
149	91 87 66 130 191 73 97 51 57 120 149	Wonder what horrible chemical they are spilling this time.
149	90 122 11 10 112 98 183 210 193 2 149	I'm gonna wreck
149	117 91 140 145 108 12 109 61 75 18 149	I don't know if it's safe to go near those things, they don't look good...
149	100 108 111 97 123 139 63 146 7 3 149	Winter is coming, these flowers will die soon.
149	62 157 85 64 119 117 77 128 205 11 149	I dont believe either of them are powerful people. No one at that party even knows them.
149	7 66 6 59 102 202 118 72 81 74 149	I bet you they cannot get that thing to fly again.
149	54 13 111 94 159 64 192 171 53 152 149	This is definitely photoshopped.
149	148 185 22 63 72 141 18 76 190 196 149	A travel for very happy to all
149	203 104 50 207 15 43 164 76 135 8 149	She is just staring at that phone. She has no idea what she is looking at.
149	53 138 93 169 151 60 186 79 47 193 149	These girls are most likely going to get hurt.
149	29 168 146 40 4 3 14 197 194 53 149	This is a real art museum?  Why does it look so boring?
149	111 87 132 44 178 93 100 106 30 148 149	all that road space and no traffic. is this a country trying to show it has money?
149	195 134 48 66 113 191 25 45 129 2 149	Why does he have such a look on his face,he cannot be trusted?
149	93 177 209 58 202 156 45 179 107 182 149	i dont think this produce looks that great actually
149	91 174 129 67 212 23 55 80 52 159 149	I don't believe they are talented.
149	117 45 207 18 162 55 36 135 84 209 149	I'm not sure she is single.
149	61 146 80 42 121 143 58 91 137 47 149	This forest is great but it won't last long.  It will be chopped down by corporate greed sooner than later.
149	87 64 62 139 44 110 18 206 74 59 149	That path looks very doubtful
149	208 7 70 57 140 129 53 99 160 193 149	I doubt those cans have soda in them.
149	174 100 121 34 55 207 167 52 197 9 149	Do we all need a home church?
149	80 114 183 197 32 210 187 203 129 34 149	I doubt I would enjoy mellow times with this.
149	208 5 207 16 187 157 74 106 19 102 149	I dont think all promises are kept!
149	192 57 145 189 21 170 15 60 138 71 149	These horses look underfed.
149	150 134 98 119 206 174 49 186 12 14 149	This place doesn't look very secure, physically or virtually.
149	163 108 30 111 60 184 13 204 85 115 149	I dont feel like you truly deserve this away
149	177 150 88 212 104 44 58 121 22 96 149	I doubt anyone could recognize where this was taken.
149	163 164 51 22 118 167 107 46 74 143 149	I still think there are 15 foot sharks in there.
149	152 207 108 196 50 200 52 173 132 85 149	i doubt this must be done by a kid
149	31 199 34 28 210 113 214 166 197 84 149	this might be the effiel tower
149	102 134 197 31 1 115 40 195 168 12 149	That place is just going to ruin.
149	119 122 99 6 61 39 83 48 165 70 149	that dog looks a bit suspicious of the toy, I don't blame him
149	28 5 86 120 145 11 135 198 175 209 149	I doubt this is considered good art.
149	83 107 150 165 78 201 14 131 8 31 149	I think they're hurting their eyes from the screens.
149	24 67 201 204 106 133 114 142 92 75 149	I doubt she comes up with any good ideas on her own
149	88 17 26 24 160 126 213 165 86 142 149	Carnival parties are fun
149	41 168 48 112 169 135 39 167 192 54 149	I'm sure someone paid a pretty penny for those but I don't think they are really worth much. They got scammed.
149	213 54 87 189 42 16 45 141 114 22 149	I've never found a 4 leaf clover.
149	28 49 129 208 65 58 99 123 16 202 149	Only because Queen Mary 1 sunk
149	95 208 146 117 98 39 106 87 30 74 149	This is where it all started.
149	215 5 120 102 152 44 196 22 99 30 149	I doubt they are as respectful as they look.
149	75 12 83 168 99 114 182 38 34 142 149	Why are they all photographing fire?
149	29 77 212 178 80 24 108 35 61 131 149	Like she's really telling them anything they don't already know. Look at his smug face.
149	29 132 179 100 110 196 86 215 134 140 149	I think they could have done better for signage in design and color...
150	156 77 130 84 188 122 213 177 5 117 150	I am going to meditate here all day
150	21 159 86 135 19 119 118 44 188 111 150	I'm going to just dive into these files to escape life.
150	175 187 179 172 77 130 30 142 207 121 150	That flag on the wall makes me want to get away somewhere remote.
150	42 8 182 122 63 35 194 207 39 120 150	I'd like to grab a dirt bike like this and just head off into the wild.
150	115 21 34 166 61 44 206 215 185 120 150	This is a beautiful place to vacation, i'd love to raft here.
150	37 1 148 87 199 89 184 40 110 166 150	I would rather be at the beach.
150	5 175 17 185 55 37 202 58 85 124 150	This is where Abraham Lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation.
150	48 33 61 172 46 207 204 178 133 214 150	I would love to have been there for this...
150	27 69 120 159 12 106 62 156 182 200 150	Time to watch a show and relax, sounds great to me.
150	116 78 191 66 93 26 138 35 72 130 150	I wish i could live under this brideg.
150	208 6 55 45 97 197 117 195 162 194 150	this photo is escapist cause it is a photo of color
150	104 77 199 26 89 53 183 85 181 106 150	The group are dreamers
150	49 47 114 211 58 83 157 168 199 153 150	I could lose myself in their music, I wish I could follow them on tour and leave this boring town behind.
150	33 177 148 191 20 194 18 208 156 84 150	It is my dream to have one of these vases in my house.
150	126 24 87 97 19 148 77 162 89 76 150	I want to run down that street screaming!
150	133 47 10 131 97 203 117 114 86 77 150	The cake is a lie! An old meme. I wish Portal were real.
150	35 119 77 134 138 174 129 107 197 10 150	I wish I could float away like that kite.
150	50 71 207 73 47 52 3 142 105 51 150	This is what I want to do when I retire.
150	8 207 168 40 188 88 73 105 197 113 150	Being a mascot must be so freeing. What a wonderful escape.
150	23 25 73 102 74 99 109 209 86 49 150	Technology has come so far and the limits can't be imagined.
150	20 114 209 153 175 128 109 200 195 33 150	what if you turn dangerous
150	9 39 83 145 126 25 193 24 128 185 150	I would love a long holiday at this location!
150	29 33 69 178 203 146 74 86 111 151 150	The  golden building stands out in the picture.
150	89 189 134 16 78 31 19 10 62 64 150	Imagine yourself as the electric current breezing through those wires, forever traveling, forever moving.
150	76 79 72 145 172 61 21 51 160 149 150	A mystical night for one to fantasise
150	192 129 35 22 114 108 128 165 190 74 150	Now where do I start with the hot-wiring?
150	30 103 215 38 158 202 26 61 170 127 150	The graffiti on the walls is very artistic.
150	104 103 4 108 167 197 42 8 93 90 150	An empty patch of ground leading to the hills of the mountains sets me to dreaming.
150	214 49 47 154 87 73 2 71 22 68 150	I wish I could escape to the south and visit a paradisiac beach!
150	38 126 77 74 139 176 182 1 121 180 150	My most beautiful escape...
150	112 67 28 181 73 78 131 36 32 62 150	Thinking kayak down
150	116 80 24 77 136 198 210 33 205 2 150	I wish I could be there! I would love to travel to Asia!
150	141 117 27 131 96 64 46 14 42 140 150	Everything can be used again for something wonderful.
150	145 112 199 20 141 87 176 95 132 179 150	If only we lived in a world where all children could grow up to be what they wanted.
150	176 56 9 89 201 10 141 96 18 154 150	This makes me want to get back to the ocean and ride some waves.
150	93 144 76 159 209 53 2 146 195 90 150	One day I'll own a mobile restaurant that people will love!
150	134 70 151 115 30 208 1 95 140 185 150	What a fancy group of people, must have money.
150	64 199 116 18 187 189 12 140 79 169 150	Chin ups are tough, I remember being in school trying these. My coach was a really old man, who smelled like soup every day.
150	105 93 49 199 208 138 102 74 41 46 150	Oh what beautiful animals.
150	180 134 149 193 33 187 164 127 38 57 150	If you put your mind to other things you can overcome any struggle.  Look at where I was just years ago.
150	58 104 66 215 114 29 202 55 181 63 150	The real question is what is the person thinking while this photograph of their eyes is being taken? They have such an intense expression.
150	50 161 52 112 8 158 111 206 41 33 150	The rush of winning the Gold! Crazy!
150	15 22 64 176 195 61 110 54 169 117 150	I don't know this person but i love the scenary.
150	82 41 73 45 172 140 106 199 25 121 150	I wonder what the view from the top looks like?
150	96 51 42 100 88 205 202 17 117 20 150	Smiling makes everything better.
150	15 42 204 60 3 143 166 82 195 135 150	I just want to put on that costume, become a wizard, and leave this world.
150	200 147 168 80 170 41 164 206 1 79 150	going to sail the open sea
150	18 9 22 3 103 43 157 106 210 133 150	This is the color I've been thinking about my whole life! It is warm and beautiful
150	191 32 76 167 174 3 82 23 129 210 150	I'd love to be able to spend time with this group of ladies.
150	128 137 136 147 153 206 193 177 122 175 150	Reminds me of my days in high school! I used to be quite the sportsman
150	131 178 50 92 70 109 93 120 214 204 150	This is what heaven must be like
150	100 92 67 110 31 182 140 170 176 87 150	I know that if he keeps working hard he will be able to make it big some day.
150	25 54 105 138 51 174 214 107 124 9 150	This two men can do anything they would like.
150	75 169 161 16 103 129 195 78 142 33 150	The balloons look like orbs from a fairy land.
150	172 156 193 103 98 36 133 93 161 10 150	I would love to be playing with them right now instead of stuck in the office.
150	67 196 66 18 54 65 49 192 33 10 150	This looks so cold, I would go home.
150	195 170 25 66 63 193 29 69 77 35 150	I wonder who is going to play the other guitar.
150	152 46 158 71 52 40 163 205 36 114 150	I wish I could board one of those ships and set sail.
150	178 155 146 168 49 102 104 74 70 185 150	Delve deep into the stars
150	176 39 85 122 33 127 174 170 191 111 150	such a beautiful view
150	87 201 144 21 148 102 38 213 138 105 150	This looks so dreamy to me
150	19 93 201 175 108 140 88 190 53 177 150	The lady near the door looks like she's ready to leave this situation.
150	1 85 184 75 146 93 15 144 211 205 150	This art piece tells the story of our future religious selfs.
150	40 213 17 158 32 75 154 9 126 91 150	I would be in deep thought.
150	73 13 117 107 28 208 37 120 84 8 150	The feel of affluence is what come to my mind as I look at this Chandelier
150	87 92 179 25 65 169 123 70 138 204 150	why is there only one white hat>?
150	84 99 155 153 41 119 61 42 1 160 150	are those off white tiles on the floor:?
150	144 206 142 72 139 57 18 196 94 84 150	I could totally do this to get some mental rest. Escape from reality.
150	79 127 200 183 141 83 115 30 180 6 150	I dream of getting that Wheel in my back yard one day...
150	115 31 36 97 32 62 181 1 48 88 150	the ceiling of that building is captivating
150	178 105 66 74 200 33 183 133 169 211 150	I wonder what her speech is about
150	36 88 101 205 34 27 96 201 213 191 150	Graffiti is a glimpse into the mindscape of another dreamer
150	8 163 80 168 123 9 88 194 190 20 150	This is so freeing!
150	208 180 49 114 181 95 213 177 50 130 150	I want to climb that tower and sit up there to reach the stars tonight.
150	59 89 109 8 158 80 115 53 141 148 150	why is the lighting so bad?
150	198 79 208 132 53 180 9 83 137 19 150	I want to leave this boring lecture.
150	197 163 34 72 37 141 121 74 43 203 150	I wonder what it would be like to go through this tunnel and make it to the other side of the window; I bet it would be interesting.
150	86 123 192 149 37 6 143 127 24 196 150	I want to be able to move like thi sbug to get away from it all.
150	30 194 8 141 111 163 122 140 92 54 150	To take a few steps here would be quite captivating.
150	201 127 212 86 175 188 171 83 190 72 150	I can imagine how these trees looked when they were young and not dead.
150	101 175 25 157 179 141 74 28 198 80 150	In my getaway checklist, I feel like this would be one of the places I'd go to
150	212 71 119 29 67 215 186 213 204 147 150	I would distract them by dancing in the middle of them
150	31 21 37 20 197 5 156 19 113 128 150	How I long to live in the era of those costumes.
150	140 173 109 135 195 90 209 110 103 126 150	If only I could be there, away from this groundhog day life of mine.
150	89 16 191 189 110 56 126 141 22 160 150	Wandering through this asian heaven in my mind.
150	147 44 213 26 193 174 185 175 11 180 150	There is nothing like a holiday sale to ease my cares aways.
150	70 26 97 104 101 170 169 144 196 179 150	I just want to listen to some of his music and forget about the world for a few minutes
150	182 49 116 76 37 58 20 29 111 149 150	I wonder how tall the bottom part of this statue is.
150	34 16 129 128 113 108 187 63 141 157 150	If the world were more perfect people would love each other and respect each other. I wish I could die now and go to heaven to avoid Naziism and the worst aspects of living with people.
150	163 6 162 114 37 96 159 40 189 57 150	Hmm i could use this map for my next DnD game
150	52 97 199 44 154 145 108 141 181 213 150	A relaxing chair for watching a movie and getting lost in it.
150	70 19 71 145 44 167 198 68 173 163 150	Rugby takes me away from all my struggles in the world, I love going to games.
150	200 102 67 9 129 59 108 95 81 49 150	Fall in line to the abyss of normalcy, or, stray away and take the higher path.
150	89 83 192 121 93 148 53 183 35 97 150	I just want to take a long vacation and forget about phones.
150	181 107 97 112 34 210 177 151 75 9 150	Someday I'm going to fly away to a remote village in the middle of nowhere.
150	138 27 3 203 67 63 76 44 95 133 150	World Series players here for sure !
150	214 113 176 49 30 191 37 1 56 133 150	The boy looked at his present imagining if this would be his escape, or trap.
150	51 104 97 175 147 177 133 185 35 102 150	Let's just grab our bikes and go where the wind takes us.
150	173 163 101 72 62 146 102 151 140 79 150	Wall climbing now; rock climbing in a month.
150	62 207 41 111 197 89 129 4 215 31 150	What a place to be. Away from this worldly problems and stress
150	1 57 149 125 76 131 110 88 114 211 150	I bet he could run for hours not thinking of anything.
150	155 157 120 140 64 63 37 93 167 129 150	I dream of the day this religion is no longer.
150	153 59 12 113 180 111 30 28 187 200 150	Grab my backpack and go, go anywhere but here.
150	32 208 189 51 121 21 92 36 123 144 150	open minded person
150	131 14 5 124 51 94 19 215 47 17 150	I want to leave this area.
150	89 25 201 162 20 17 207 47 10 166 150	I wish I could buy a Harley right now.
150	125 2 197 90 183 111 207 13 4 193 150	Ah, the beauty that lies on the water. One day, i'll have an even larger boat and just sail away with my bride
150	192 179 112 63 107 196 15 33 54 88 150	Let's drive. I don't care where.
150	133 88 66 171 129 199 154 182 160 56 150	This looks like the perfect place for me to run away to.
150	158 90 7 203 195 123 120 87 115 63 150	I don't want to see this painting anymore.
150	80 180 84 85 210 4 37 32 33 161 150	This is the type of place that really lets you step outside yourself and think about the bigger things.
150	8 199 131 165 133 168 89 75 186 144 150	It's amazing what you can accomplish the the right filter. Looks like a painting!
150	68 52 90 100 182 106 169 6 59 173 150	What is that in your hand?
150	12 88 203 39 47 63 101 186 190 72 150	I want to get out of here...this guy looks out of it.
150	33 197 31 153 30 13 27 152 74 169 150	Purple sends my imagination flying.
150	154 57 94 81 130 174 103 136 11 137 150	This expensive coffee can cause one to be a nervousw wreck.
150	179 69 98 165 202 214 17 123 127 67 150	I would like view a different angle.
150	190 169 50 167 61 51 196 69 205 41 150	I want to leave. These wax figures are scary.
150	124 72 6 198 113 79 69 192 87 64 150	I want to leave this view back home.
150	190 8 135 151 115 207 70 13 153 93 150	Looks like this man knows magic. Amazing.
150	161 47 196 120 23 81 49 148 114 108 150	Gazing through the trees and seeing the blue sky helps me forget all of my troubles.
150	57 64 214 85 75 124 190 179 58 99 150	I wish I could afford a grand car.
150	131 93 140 126 13 186 63 44 114 196 150	Children see the wonders of the universe.
150	109 191 184 166 33 148 80 111 34 147 150	I want to avoid seeing her.
150	10 28 74 92 186 105 153 21 77 180 150	this could be the first gym on the moon!
150	70 16 31 1 142 65 163 28 95 204 150	Just want to take this train and go far far away from this worldly problems
150	167 105 165 99 86 205 78 38 179 24 150	I wish they would play all night and I wouldn't have to return to the real world.
150	139 85 213 148 23 140 67 92 136 137 150	I could float on these clouds forever
150	196 4 120 106 213 164 101 16 191 88 150	I need to stay away from bees.
150	211 27 118 187 102 199 37 105 60 114 150	Forget running with the bulls, I want to run with the goats!
150	130 120 33 114 214 25 59 196 4 21 150	I hope to one day have a child as cute as this one of my own.
150	118 94 53 133 93 21 25 163 43 206 150	Oh, to be a stingray, swimming smoothly and swiftly through the shallows and depths of the great blue sea!
150	215 3 211 149 63 202 41 210 130 2 150	Ok, finally 2 hours just watching a game! please dont end!
150	35 122 76 66 36 38 153 89 30 10 150	Folk music send me back in time when things were simpler
150	215 28 77 127 96 133 137 41 68 142 150	I shall eject myself out of here as soon as the UFO appears.
150	7 138 162 78 160 132 159 174 214 25 150	If I could be anything it would be an explorer...
150	61 27 161 5 156 12 106 13 205 52 150	The artwork looks like a mixture of roman and aztec... Those time periods must have been very interesting to live in
150	37 112 167 59 122 147 169 34 35 104 150	A lone flower grows amoungst the death.
150	202 73 21 63 188 175 144 200 159 1 150	I wonder what's on the other side of that wall. I think I'd like to go there.
150	124 194 138 29 197 82 169 179 143 2 150	Wow I sometimes dream of a place almost as beautiful as this one.  I wish I could visit.
150	151 125 103 205 88 111 108 24 84 191 150	Some say it's spooky, but I love being out in the woods at sunset.
150	181 85 59 27 34 2 118 90 87 120 150	We need a sign like that in World of Warcraft for people who stand in the fire.
150	67 112 104 7 49 140 33 138 193 155 150	I really need to get away and join a party like this.
150	132 6 5 42 41 87 118 201 89 36 150	If only I could boat away on a river like this.
150	205 190 53 6 79 89 168 69 118 137 150	Oh to run away to far off places like this.
150	18 42 53 212 117 133 41 215 167 124 150	By prohibiting few irritating activities in the public relieves from unpleasant realities.
150	158 154 172 19 110 55 39 18 15 22 150	I wish I could float in a hot air balloon away into that sunset.
150	98 192 178 134 111 136 212 57 17 117 150	Making this special soup takes me back to my times as a child in the freedom of the countryside.
150	108 49 171 90 161 191 16 68 25 59 150	An attractive art always please to watch! a stress relief.
150	62 8 70 175 162 159 55 128 86 72 150	These here could kill a grown man in 5 bites.
150	19 51 58 161 135 91 86 16 184 201 150	An animal or a mystical beast?
150	129 36 160 121 71 184 54 15 185 176 150	This porch is stunning.  I would like to build one on my home some day.
150	164 78 99 191 109 7 27 39 122 33 150	Wow, I could lose myself in a place like that
150	106 183 58 122 66 67 2 124 62 37 150	how peaceful it must be to be a cow, no drama no cares
150	210 95 70 41 36 28 168 119 173 33 150	Oh how I'd love to be a farm animal, grazing the day away with only my thoughts to distract me.
150	213 108 45 199 120 130 88 72 73 175 150	As the lights flashed, I envision a better future for everyone and am hopeful for the future.
150	68 56 175 194 134 86 187 6 120 70 150	I would love to swim across the lake and climb that mountain!
150	189 164 139 93 29 195 46 145 77 20 150	boring & excited time
150	95 2 155 131 49 74 132 22 118 47 150	I want to be floating on a boat near a beach.
150	67 177 147 105 54 63 192 139 148 156 150	hard work pays off
150	148 145 50 4 125 55 8 6 75 108 150	I am always away from the boring talks, I love movies!
150	199 2 182 207 15 181 67 149 172 88 150	It must be a new method of acupuncture and wouldn't know it unless I tried it. Maybe it increases blood flow?!
150	84 64 42 82 192 9 108 185 87 4 150	Johnny always turns to cooking for a release from world. I think this is why his culinary are so superb!
150	117 16 201 170 154 26 56 13 22 29 150	Oh, I dream of owning that costume one day.

152	2 116 214 38 46 122 129 72 68 65 152	I want to play with him and wrestle!
152	200 58 11 192 71 186 67 106 208 150 152	Making a lot of noise while cleaning
152	210 87 203 85 124 193 175 207 181 93 152	Taking this egg and smashing it against the wall would be a blast!
152	5 100 151 183 66 191 212 27 143 161 152	Let's pack as many people as we can into that thing and just drive!
152	202 75 10 175 14 30 174 67 87 1 152	The boy scouts need to stop slacking off.
152	60 168 25 200 149 179 63 188 93 103 152	Dude seems like a good place to throw a partayy
152	6 201 105 78 96 28 12 100 150 177 152	I want to go hang out at this place and be really loud!
152	90 106 82 184 178 96 42 169 174 168 152	He looks like he's up to no good.
152	102 154 12 177 10 50 214 148 199 16 152	Nights like this make me want to round the boys up and play a nice game of football.
152	3 36 85 20 34 117 178 210 41 54 152	Only one drink each!? you guys need to steep up your game if you want to have fun
152	149 189 90 97 95 202 37 44 174 178 152	LOL. WHAT IS EVEN GOING ON?????
152	201 8 19 179 213 146 155 208 141 77 152	Probably needs fixing after the raging party we had there last night.
152	150 167 194 195 111 213 214 164 176 22 152	I bet we could conga line right through that building.
152	78 165 6 13 140 15 82 127 147 7 152	woo hoo do a wheelie
152	162 207 126 4 155 6 64 11 212 92 152	I could fight all of them at once.
152	190 1 145 29 194 94 15 8 9 100 152	Wrap the kid up in electric wire with bare lightbulbs sticking out? Sure, why not!
152	71 5 124 10 2 181 145 77 187 198 152	We are going to have a bonfire out here tonight.
152	164 24 109 83 145 61 96 85 76 36 152	Why is there a picture of flowers?!
152	182 200 65 202 196 123 191 104 29 185 152	It may look like an ordinary bird, but it was definitely about to start some stuff
152	37 163 112 118 199 46 177 181 183 122 152	You need to get out of here
152	144 3 30 65 161 214 119 6 64 186 152	This party needs some livening up! Maybe some shots?
152	174 28 86 160 175 76 193 162 43 164 152	I'm ready to take on who ever is in the ring.
152	214 59 134 68 136 7 100 49 126 76 152	LETS GET OUR SKI'S AND GO!
152	17 211 194 153 31 14 166 122 118 146 152	FOOD FIGHT NOW!
152	104 48 151 113 71 214 58 130 126 42 152	Energy drink and a lake, a nice combination for some crazy memories
152	64 58 198 52 71 31 170 142 171 172 152	I want to throw that mud!
152	134 59 128 185 17 35 203 60 80 198 152	That's how my last friday ended!
152	195 29 21 53 167 16 199 144 165 177 152	he is hurting this cat, lets punish him!
152	10 110 13 56 7 154 207 189 111 53 152	This color makes me feel like dancing!
152	6 31 66 58 17 200 41 126 120 131 152	the horses are not happy
152	60 45 44 141 75 172 115 25 202 33 152	Those banana stuffed towys you can win from the carnival are so dumb, we should knock them all down.
152	31 166 2 203 198 19 14 123 29 147 152	This guy knows how to get the party started!!
152	44 184 73 51 50 45 13 30 130 20 152	Those kids look noisy to me
152	109 117 186 84 88 147 185 15 93 151 152	Let's steal this bike and pop wheelies along the trail.
152	22 137 167 141 159 17 206 58 128 123 152	Flip the switch! Flip the Switch! Flip the Switch!
152	210 54 197 4 101 93 186 10 27 131 152	Get out of the way! Moooove!
152	112 41 94 129 195 131 140 66 172 38 152	Who's ready for a snowball fight?!
152	50 35 156 61 21 43 76 155 153 80 152	These kids sang rock instead of the assigned national anthem.
152	124 168 74 145 148 40 214 85 164 68 152	Excellent landscape, excellent photo and excellent place
152	67 59 20 34 160 173 73 189 107 205 152	Is that a painting?? It looks so boring! Add something fun like a theme park!!
152	59 136 93 30 14 196 70 65 23 24 152	I bet I could climb up to that balcony!
152	33 35 185 70 140 119 157 43 108 67 152	I want to party with them!
152	66 81 144 141 72 43 65 142 13 108 152	Time to mess up this fine work of art
152	92 143 128 4 37 82 91 148 127 8 152	Lets rustle up some fun.
152	95 207 183 192 49 16 92 102 69 133 152	This looks like a fun place to do par kor.
152	50 211 178 67 130 205 7 120 141 124 152	I want to scream in their ears!
152	120 34 211 122 148 192 18 57 117 58 152	Watch your step dudes!!
152	128 35 167 113 179 101 80 94 10 8 152	That dog looks like it has the same thing in mind as I do, running around and making the most noise possible!
152	155 90 193 103 153 44 47 92 32 5 152	Can this baby stop crying. Jeez I've never heard him shut up
152	68 170 49 212 59 121 141 62 87 150 152	Where are the crowds?
152	61 197 137 73 26 100 209 211 141 189 152	I'm going to throw a giant party in here.  It's going to be really wild.
152	71 209 38 181 66 21 151 200 53 74 152	Those two are always causing problems in the museum.
152	213 90 209 139 133 200 79 169 96 107 152	I wanna party in that house!
152	150 148 153 144 14 50 175 12 99 82 152	Lets just start throwing the rocks!
152	34 183 75 195 91 151 11 19 70 89 152	Great place to skateboard
152	215 92 90 207 86 32 160 199 5 48 152	I wanna chase it around
152	133 45 48 112 130 92 148 35 67 53 152	I wanna shoot that crow
152	75 34 85 78 92 8 39 21 196 120 152	I'd be bouncing off those walls
152	107 34 180 132 46 68 39 162 78 209 152	I wish they would all cheer as loud as they could.
152	47 157 208 43 193 63 46 8 1 71 152	Let's have a rager here! Tell everyone!
152	194 35 1 163 209 192 196 25 183 30 152	Love the colors and noise these buses are making. It's remind me of my concert.
152	57 150 99 149 181 155 147 9 192 138 152	It's a royal rumble in the park and that guy's down for the count.  OH YEAH BROTHER!
152	59 72 201 196 182 54 193 100 192 82 152	The crowd isn't happy.
152	158 40 55 69 204 129 64 16 25 200 152	I make a lot of noise
152	107 115 170 70 14 65 210 151 179 207 152	Let's get busy
152	19 180 110 104 17 148 64 28 209 199 152	Yeah, show them your pride, man!
152	1 93 112 34 174 105 122 146 9 202 152	I just want to tear up these flowers to make confetti.
152	117 68 62 23 94 193 197 96 157 38 152	These guys look like they're from Hogwarts.  10 POINTS TO GRYFFINDOR!!!
152	134 99 1 132 194 142 177 151 30 208 152	I feel disorderly when looking at these houses.
152	166 118 182 71 158 76 130 62 119 179 152	I am confused by this scenery. Can't grasp my feelings by looking at this shot
152	139 126 176 200 33 103 197 211 36 195 152	Let's start the conga line people!
152	194 211 59 75 184 3 7 37 5 72 152	I want to drive that car! I bet it goes fast! VROOM!
152	114 184 77 32 174 162 41 145 36 48 152	Can you open your mouth any wider?
152	122 27 142 204 89 31 212 90 54 213 152	These fences will not keep me out.
152	62 92 188 123 86 59 149 95 90 102 152	Nothing better than having a few drinks at a sidewalk cafe!
152	45 205 50 101 125 191 53 184 110 136 152	the sun looks very riotous
152	197 100 150 140 112 134 73 198 183 167 152	This is going to rock!
152	19 13 148 160 179 54 185 109 191 3 152	Yeah, I'd love to bring a jackhammer into this area and make a real racket!
152	196 114 29 153 66 15 191 208 53 125 152	I want party on this ride!
152	144 203 83 74 183 127 139 132 114 92 152	Get it done and make the audience party man!
152	67 19 46 16 13 79 207 123 18 168 152	That wood is just begging to have something rude scratched into it!
152	194 111 77 66 205 182 170 143 183 100 152	We are gonna party hardy after this meeting.
152	156 191 171 212 178 143 124 15 118 214 152	This landscaping is a disgrace.
152	159 89 135 201 71 196 19 52 211 141 152	Let's get inside it and roll it down the hill!
152	11 173 201 14 178 150 133 161 167 171 152	The darkness does not know anything
152	6 49 69 36 134 88 48 78 17 62 152	Imagine sliding down on each part of that roof!
152	44 103 148 96 76 151 109 106 108 146 152	Pick up the rocks
152	120 13 70 178 119 93 208 99 82 4 152	Those look really bad, I want to run over and just rip all that off the walls and yell at them for their poor decorative choices.
152	3 171 4 8 84 106 41 75 188 156 152	Who won't be wild with us here?
152	213 29 19 59 165 9 70 33 73 197 152	Watch out - these guys have bicycle road rage!
152	196 194 96 22 128 78 101 83 106 186 152	Such a fast jet
152	9 30 130 99 60 105 93 88 178 113 152	the picture needs to be higher
152	23 68 125 83 127 198 194 81 14 95 152	I got so fed up with the work truck that I just drove it straight over a cliff!
152	188 137 214 60 119 213 131 46 145 127 152	I love the rodeo and all the festivities!
152	154 210 44 54 197 72 123 179 59 66 152	It would be fun to have a party in that mountain range.
152	43 58 181 168 195 28 155 134 74 44 152	It'd be a shame if these "accidentally" fell onto the floor
152	206 202 36 12 157 140 105 191 28 201 152	I can't believe Starbucks got my drink order wrong.... AGAIN!?
152	114 71 22 19 162 125 96 76 100 148 152	They should throw things from that platform. Get the party started.
152	36 76 117 53 174 173 137 211 162 153 152	Surfers could have a riot here.
152	35 9 64 197 194 79 16 103 189 180 152	Is that guy making out with a trash can?
152	10 64 101 16 97 7 124 51 201 12 152	Let's party little bro!
152	188 35 130 113 52 24 118 34 115 27 152	I'm going to call all my friends to have a rave here.
152	119 106 118 79 99 58 77 52 43 111 152	Let's get this party going people. Stand up!
152	101 110 150 59 164 32 204 90 107 49 152	Skateboarding on the ancient stones seem like a good idea.
152	140 108 159 116 119 153 77 94 49 21 152	Go knock them all over lol!!
152	210 141 178 160 124 63 23 126 164 88 152	Run up on stage and toss her around, boys!
152	193 54 157 10 90 98 171 14 203 144 152	I remember doing this in school and always getting in trouble for looking at anything but what I was supposed to be looking at.
152	180 12 173 129 199 215 142 136 111 109 152	How awesome would it be to bungee jump off something that high!?
152	177 167 8 185 83 130 193 110 30 148 152	Probably getting way more informative data from this than actual voting but who am I to say anything
152	124 12 88 134 185 202 49 158 86 20 152	Teaching your kid how to throw skipping rocks, my kinda kid right there.
152	42 37 192 173 114 120 58 66 175 128 152	I would like to light some firecrackers from the top of the crane and have a wild party.
152	8 136 28 182 61 4 121 198 65 206 152	This makes me want to turn off the lights, grab my glow sticks and PARTY!
152	63 102 138 39 181 139 130 107 8 58 152	These streets are party central!
152	65 67 142 126 113 104 64 150 198 97 152	Let's shake this place up...it's too quiet!
152	75 175 95 190 143 171 89 102 197 122 152	It looks like a great day to take the bad boy for a spin.
153	127 174 112 59 1 194 76 148 160 6 153	Well I guess the wiring is alright.
153	110 202 50 136 40 7 210 49 101 63 153	Red, just like the red brick walls in my house.
153	185 81 202 147 52 112 186 178 92 48 153	That character is frightening...
153	187 106 110 21 180 139 11 2 176 181 153	Must be hockey on grass.
153	213 93 109 166 12 40 202 184 84 175 153	I don't see any trees in the forest.
153	111 5 196 99 119 78 104 50 65 33 153	enola sdnats tInalB
153	88 94 121 115 155 45 30 33 7 211 153	The guy has been in the sun to long because he looks scorched
153	82 99 97 25 202 5 95 93 133 84 153	Do you think they like the color blue?
153	35 150 29 7 51 207 85 21 67 152 153	What a grey day in a grey city. It looks like such a boring place.
153	181 163 152 193 80 55 199 116 103 138 153	Boring lunch conversation
153	5 61 54 187 194 210 85 155 17 180 153	Guess I had one too many
153	187 111 193 51 71 198 166 24 90 135 153	I don't want to think about winter anymore.
153	174 116 135 105 108 183 16 46 189 52 153	This city can be cool.
153	158 27 211 57 20 12 215 145 83 199 153	Looks like warm weather.
153	34 163 211 89 85 173 71 42 119 86 153	Eh, nature is okay.
153	83 151 113 147 15 102 51 110 160 69 153	Two people obviously drinking. It's what people do.
153	195 161 171 92 201 121 89 64 173 48 153	This is too cute.
153	18 165 32 45 122 144 166 43 208 99 153	As if the average simpleton would read these.
153	39 126 125 71 49 81 110 75 3 61 153	They dug a hole in the front yard.
153	83 198 107 41 179 148 66 77 145 125 153	The two boys lack moisture
153	76 161 117 43 26 18 70 147 27 91 153	The tranquil color blue reminds me of the sea and the sky.
153	207 51 151 108 203 56 66 138 116 118 153	What a cute little town.
153	157 206 194 112 208 91 147 46 203 201 153	This bench is not appropriate.
153	102 47 151 4 97 150 117 184 45 75 153	That is a weed flower.
153	29 32 117 204 189 109 150 183 179 73 153	I hope the bird can fly.
153	57 211 71 58 141 165 16 132 174 119 153	Great photo, I like the lighting.
153	198 115 191 43 108 38 112 163 204 148 153	Oh what a lot of water.
153	29 70 54 146 83 37 189 161 48 11 153	I'm very thirsty but that water is way too fast for me.
153	74 130 2 202 213 204 197 66 51 67 153	What a picture.
153	94 108 166 38 43 149 182 161 9 8 153	They think they are cute together.
153	207 201 125 62 189 75 45 108 134 190 153	The exclamation point did not have the desired outcome on the screen.
153	66 110 61 125 132 145 161 78 106 115 153	They are googling how to make a wooden car.
153	193 33 161 205 40 176 170 135 87 48 153	That statue looks old
153	54 119 104 80 63 65 141 95 58 201 153	Target practice soldier
153	79 105 30 211 184 87 70 96 130 209 153	That would be a photo of Rattus norvegicus.
153	62 70 106 1 195 172 143 144 72 183 153	Mountains. Snow. I can't imagine it's less barren in the summer.
153	155 189 152 100 18 68 120 106 196 111 153	Don't smile or nothing.
153	136 113 92 180 126 143 51 214 28 207 153	These children will one day grow up.
153	185 52 207 203 70 156 23 163 209 60 153	It's the Eiffel Tower.
153	27 163 129 181 26 215 63 209 79 206 153	This is a very professional photo.
153	27 183 132 181 25 90 125 5 209 74 153	The tree is growing close to the water.  It appears to have started as a bush that grew well.
153	9 135 86 196 194 10 61 63 163 202 153	It's very brown,
153	58 212 198 56 33 189 122 166 214 115 153	Those men look quite uniform.
153	189 197 63 185 7 17 150 195 139 9 153	Bearded mand and his presumed wife.  That's about as average as it gets.
153	51 18 191 65 104 53 105 83 113 54 153	This is such an average drive in the city.
153	215 110 155 163 107 48 67 97 148 200 153	The sun is getting hot.
153	200 116 61 145 33 174 164 18 11 142 153	Could use a cleaning before a picture.
153	4 124 10 54 210 49 151 90 211 107 153	So this is what happens when kids get outside time.
153	93 61 30 4 52 157 102 210 79 95 153	that's definitely a statue.
153	93 65 43 175 174 152 191 18 125 32 153	i have never ridden in one of these. and probably never will.
153	29 177 149 90 138 70 193 28 211 69 153	Yellow balloon. How cheerful.
153	204 191 209 101 154 11 74 51 54 122 153	What is he looking at?
153	98 45 89 161 62 84 196 171 154 27 153	wow, a cat.
153	100 17 190 77 4 74 142 205 197 180 153	people walking in the woods
153	75 104 195 29 172 39 73 141 128 65 153	Hope the driver had insurance.
153	7 50 136 55 86 45 139 14 42 18 153	Like my mother always said, never look straight into a hole.
153	188 110 52 171 182 7 103 82 74 130 153	It's so quiet here.
153	128 184 185 72 148 90 84 52 196 215 153	A picture of a chandelier
153	50 156 92 88 206 8 89 185 65 73 153	This picture reminds me of the 80's
153	123 17 172 116 36 157 195 53 100 158 153	They don't even seem interested.
153	64 85 121 168 54 195 188 8 14 132 153	Consider the lobster.
153	139 146 163 77 188 62 61 199 39 175 153	We really need to care for our glaciers.
153	29 108 37 39 168 114 155 4 213 82 153	Writing in a notebook is boring.
153	41 151 128 198 61 187 98 197 200 108 153	This man looks antisocial and dull.
153	31 152 60 213 173 172 73 79 35 118 153	Magic isn't real.
153	181 52 71 137 5 29 147 142 101 116 153	Now if we could only fill the pot holes
153	158 39 136 73 59 123 114 134 9 83 153	Those kids are dressed up for halloween.
153	174 104 57 210 96 68 41 20 149 48 153	o man an electric fence
153	12 212 143 39 98 191 7 59 142 116 153	The land was parched.
153	53 192 30 70 191 47 177 125 78 17 153	This small town is slightly depressing.
153	164 13 146 53 49 105 57 44 72 4 153	To be honest, that doesn't look very appealing...I'd have to try to it to see.
153	86 160 145 48 136 60 98 42 70 120 153	At least it isn't as humid up there as it is down where I live!
153	186 202 199 114 57 168 208 131 142 154 153	The vegetation has completely dried up.
153	58 173 22 1 187 205 29 8 171 181 153	it's a dog
153	180 8 154 17 193 198 130 173 63 48 153	is there anything of interest here?
153	19 81 59 119 37 54 138 124 148 189 153	that's a cute little squirrel on a rock
153	94 57 36 111 68 122 35 179 52 140 153	This is information on capital.
153	207 141 179 71 158 215 200 31 174 199 153	The environment seems really dry.
153	99 195 142 1 140 9 149 13 3 159 153	Two guards doing their job.
153	188 89 69 42 24 84 167 57 154 76 153	It's just a bunch of colors, yippee.
153	35 141 77 123 17 195 198 7 132 209 153	Coffee beans roasting
153	182 92 192 120 169 180 191 37 6 63 153	These flowers will bloom at some point.
153	182 36 91 162 167 152 117 66 64 2 153	What an eyesore.
153	38 211 118 37 168 89 187 165 154 176 153	very dark picture
153	215 99 33 205 4 75 67 68 135 182 153	The building looks old
153	100 51 35 150 66 135 15 56 61 155 153	Something shady going on here...
153	137 138 130 150 114 154 49 173 73 124 153	Those are old statues.
153	125 55 93 213 135 92 215 89 75 64 153	I can't comprehend this painting.
153	108 25 176 115 102 139 170 41 36 128 153	It's a ginger kid.
153	118 193 113 13 25 137 182 110 76 190 153	It's graffiti on a wall.
153	47 198 84 49 187 175 92 126 54 142 153	The sky looks blue.
153	84 94 159 22 212 98 204 111 50 140 153	this is a unique
153	52 108 124 181 3 34 83 172 165 176 153	The phone is gone.
153	41 46 174 17 83 158 78 206 182 14 153	Looks like Pacman got tipped over.
153	55 114 139 18 28 22 118 194 1 58 153	A cow statue and a plant in the background
153	61 129 182 176 195 210 211 116 89 80 153	Water is boring to splash in.
153	199 106 8 99 212 76 156 160 100 10 153	Because no one has ever taken a picture of a sunset before. Clever.
153	124 199 97 41 141 189 50 85 14 205 153	What a vague picture
153	74 191 104 129 25 10 182 36 135 77 153	Tickets sold out but where is the audience?
153	140 65 114 141 91 211 121 61 66 107 153	She started running faster when she found out the prize was a DSW gift card
153	120 15 123 168 5 17 204 124 68 105 153	that is just pretty
153	94 214 130 146 196 73 14 152 131 139 153	All I see is a pile of wasted paint on the floor.
153	17 120 189 193 4 52 43 32 185 67 153	Yes, the dreaded paper tree.
153	105 28 193 152 122 210 165 100 39 33 153	That boy is sitting.
153	121 144 25 123 16 64 82 125 133 186 153	The gentlemen wait for their beverage as they are extremely parched.
153	174 73 96 193 101 184 136 99 74 180 153	What a bland view.
153	196 74 215 178 93 207 51 4 156 106 153	This woman is boring me, her story is so lame.
153	4 147 107 33 103 203 139 69 67 21 153	This view is average.
153	136 35 16 93 201 80 97 4 28 204 153	Drinking is not good for you
153	122 98 4 192 50 148 126 71 60 107 153	These two girls are standing in front of candles.
153	169 134 205 104 188 65 173 54 41 7 153	The flowers appear to be a vibrant red.
153	69 13 157 136 35 169 116 62 7 196 153	The countryside can be a dirty wasteland.
153	178 148 46 93 43 25 54 3 26 7 153	That shirt seems like it needs some ironing
153	53 14 118 214 108 122 116 176 123 154 153	It is just a pink flower!
153	140 173 190 38 123 30 56 96 63 84 153	Not many people in the seats.
153	75 46 57 34 186 120 194 152 49 21 153	It's just a flower no big deal.
153	46 141 60 9 211 167 33 72 47 59 153	I only see two people in Halloween costumes here.
153	25 80 86 14 201 71 1 129 63 132 153	It's Christmas time alright. Funny.
153	120 106 29 116 87 63 79 112 93 144 153	I've seen nicer photos
153	34 30 49 53 85 20 170 87 107 138 153	Curling is a sport popular in Canada.
153	106 186 38 142 56 200 150 171 213 114 153	Black and white, check. Gate, check. Trees, check.
153	214 103 123 146 163 67 8 176 101 157 153	Your head was tilted a bit too much.
153	167 174 152 70 7 115 157 99 121 198 153	Hmmm, an infinity pool.
153	132 192 1 140 8 203 9 151 118 54 153	The diver continues to dive at depths unknown to us, while we wait to see what he dives to let us think about diving.
153	206 161 50 178 37 17 70 195 163 18 153	I am not a fan of car racing. It is not very fun to watch.
153	85 139 164 1 131 162 42 174 130 123 153	I wish it would rain it's hot
153	185 181 55 54 45 166 138 144 96 168 153	Dang it's hot
153	131 166 115 133 50 65 55 184 8 146 153	A guy is riding a bike down the street. Wow.
153	32 74 59 185 164 83 70 189 27 6 153	Smoking is so crazy
153	54 207 169 208 101 108 36 49 114 175 153	Weddings are for people with feelings.
153	195 108 84 143 33 196 6 64 192 151 153	Nice scenic view.
153	66 129 203 197 114 155 21 192 39 120 153	They should have dressed better for the photo.
153	182 205 66 30 190 50 100 53 137 27 153	You'd need a fishing pole to get it fresher.
153	110 81 170 113 158 165 107 191 106 212 153	We that is such a nice guitar, I bet he loves playing that.
153	9 131 141 113 143 170 152 157 64 165 153	Half of a baby child.
153	107 165 62 16 56 12 17 6 96 191 153	These kids all order the blue plate special.
153	215 126 91 45 3 203 184 111 47 212 153	i hate darkness. bring back the light
153	29 56 99 58 119 61 207 190 213 197 153	I would rather just go to the shop behind them.
153	59 109 177 118 142 122 193 97 157 175 153	Cockatiels are wild birds in some places where it doesn't rain.
153	17 169 34 18 92 214 131 127 212 76 153	Bagpipes don't sound great.
153	70 124 180 68 135 154 98 208 192 13 153	These are pink flamingos.
153	199 175 31 1 38 206 116 83 202 77 153	She is on a swing.
153	130 29 188 18 180 172 81 115 205 103 153	That is many televisions.
153	87 47 31 6 209 57 53 108 106 145 153	She is trying to sing.
153	202 41 24 67 101 206 186 110 63 145 153	Asian and their dance, whatever
153	60 52 154 23 163 120 49 10 37 12 153	Neat photo, I like the stairs.
153	83 110 98 180 164 54 182 4 63 181 153	Woman walking by man.
153	102 45 193 188 214 61 11 118 110 23 153	Big deal, its just water.
153	33 130 168 93 113 120 95 139 129 212 153	Its uneasy to talk about this topic, but okay with my loved one!
153	119 108 137 33 211 12 25 148 82 60 153	Not the most exciting art I've ever seen, truth be told.
153	22 137 188 157 167 168 191 85 127 97 153	Nap time for the dogs.
153	28 41 16 142 17 161 188 205 175 174 153	they are just standing there
153	104 115 99 61 1 175 179 24 73 127 153	An old photo from the air
153	20 207 158 134 113 150 10 187 85 26 153	There are a lot of spectators for something as dull as judo or karate.
153	211 114 107 84 19 134 44 178 12 14 153	Nice clothing i guess man.
153	169 160 38 199 115 141 186 185 65 162 153	I think this is nice.
153	60 65 110 23 34 122 197 51 169 203 153	This photo is good.
153	86 179 168 64 167 53 144 190 113 8 153	How the mighty have fallen.
153	37 185 84 59 180 146 40 72 56 124 153	Typical sunset photo.
153	131 200 129 201 113 137 173 117 82 154 153	A baby in grass. Not a big deal.
153	150 103 4 46 119 68 110 190 191 48 153	It could look better with a different paint job.
153	98 183 163 5 16 175 167 7 212 134 153	I don't like the look of these flowers
153	174 75 61 49 188 141 104 145 41 58 153	This looks incredibly boring.
153	113 211 172 187 112 157 19 36 6 42 153	what the heck is this?
153	60 104 101 39 194 197 33 191 169 132 153	Theres a lot of dust as the little car speeds by.
153	177 84 11 121 93 114 181 129 75 49 153	Surely they didn't kill those bulldogs to take them with them when they passed!
153	68 164 79 182 2 170 207 42 163 172 153	This is the kind of place I should retire so I can get far enough away from the Internet it can't even touch me.
153	138 167 76 98 105 40 177 63 16 112 153	She's not asian though
153	183 134 146 56 28 178 99 97 38 87 153	This is a rose, which grows outdoors
153	171 33 78 66 141 70 53 65 22 116 153	These chairs are nothing special.
153	184 67 202 41 24 1 131 133 135 126 153	Black and white makes everything look better.
153	10 4 57 185 39 136 32 167 19 122 153	What the heck is that ball of hair doing out there by the tree, is it even alive?

153	108 205 195 12 3 166 173 138 167 144 153	A simple photo of two boys in hats.
153	68 84 53 185 122 26 64 143 156 65 153	Just some white cars
153	138 115 60 154 14 58 213 211 144 62 153	Well theres some art i guess
153	177 101 60 87 117 106 11 200 83 198 153	Cool, black and white.
153	172 163 121 152 131 66 12 44 24 6 153	Drink your drink
153	138 96 151 68 115 22 112 156 98 26 153	The woman needs a drink.
153	132 80 140 187 10 152 73 34 54 105 153	He looks like a regular bald musician.
153	188 120 181 84 34 205 83 129 111 99 153	They're just sitting there.
153	172 173 116 6 156 69 209 11 110 50 153	Another night in the concrete city.
153	186 181 159 169 67 79 49 43 201 196 153	Oh look another college party. I'm shocked at the amount of alcohol.
153	100 72 6 188 113 194 102 207 156 57 153	Whare is this
153	175 18 170 86 102 171 23 36 202 213 153	Did they lose?
153	205 203 60 180 141 43 176 198 35 108 153	This draft was slated to be crafted better
154	71 32 169 8 3 92 135 188 130 42 154	I'm preparing myself for a pool adventure.
154	206 78 131 76 60 132 6 84 167 67 154	I've been here before.
154	96 161 128 208 69 78 20 179 200 53 154	This looks like an old building at night.  There could be a little more light to make it feel safer but it looks kind of engaging.
154	160 137 214 199 71 188 99 207 170 130 154	I would remain in the middle ground before siding with the man
154	208 143 24 207 40 30 78 18 34 85 154	They're having a nice time. Great.
154	169 95 171 2 202 114 40 1 172 69 154	What a dull day, i'd be sleeping.
154	160 121 48 105 208 97 4 102 49 1 154	The man stayed in the middle of judgement
154	16 181 205 9 192 165 48 171 166 91 154	I am impartial to bugs bunny
154	44 183 194 145 162 37 103 76 121 177 154	That picture is okay. There's not a lot to it.
154	174 206 4 38 20 90 150 48 113 68 154	I could take or leave this sign.  It's fine, not bad, not great either.
154	44 199 46 139 131 91 178 180 58 73 154	It's a car racing on dirt.
154	66 26 161 23 38 132 56 21 179 37 154	Seems like a decent day.
154	6 95 10 45 43 148 165 87 191 143 154	That sign is visible.
154	50 140 212 188 71 207 40 168 65 98 154	This guy is their father.
154	124 3 108 95 61 181 170 144 157 23 154	These are boys. They are walking.
154	60 90 5 14 177 7 195 55 142 92 154	That's a lot of student walking down.
154	137 181 179 170 193 130 184 5 91 22 154	These plants are pretty blah

154	12 170 79 38 214 47 146 192 20 134 154	The city lights are the same in every city.
154	184 24 2 79 47 211 168 124 73 161 154	It's not warm out but it's not cold out.
154	205 187 38 7 14 83 70 6 68 138 154	It takes a lot of space to store highway barriers when they are not in use.
154	134 74 81 188 105 161 43 106 116 202 154	An okay coat. Not too bad, but not stunning either.
154	143 123 111 192 27 70 17 144 49 43 154	This is an alright bell. I neither like it nor dislike it.
154	83 179 82 81 127 71 115 60 197 34 154	I don't really have an opinion on the Olympics. They're okay.
154	132 186 185 85 201 101 141 28 49 83 154	This is a party.
154	21 55 59 165 10 124 211 43 83 153 154	It's the color green. One of the many colors.
154	27 89 36 191 173 212 170 92 102 75 154	Great for kids, doesn't do much though
154	140 199 104 188 19 53 111 98 178 34 154	Be beautiful to see one of these in an antique car show.
154	214 203 117 8 93 142 101 6 156 159 154	What a beautiful land.
154	206 93 119 136 150 160 114 91 72 130 154	Many people use this bridge for their daily commute to work.
154	210 32 126 192 174 81 90 143 208 149 154	Ill just stand here and agree with everything
154	65 92 202 155 83 10 84 114 180 178 154	This car is an A to B kind of car.
154	63 188 115 205 62 171 78 25 144 8 154	Here is a gate in an airport.
154	169 136 25 106 36 177 105 62 138 139 154	Her shirt is more blue than the sky.
154	115 165 175 174 127 164 108 68 26 98 154	I wish sailboats could go even faster.
154	88 153 120 55 110 35 96 59 44 162 154	Racing is a fun sport.
154	178 157 189 65 194 184 88 80 90 204 154	We are just a plain couple of sheep.
154	29 208 84 182 2 209 31 116 86 100 154	A nice meeting being had
154	7 104 138 22 94 176 178 141 189 163 154	Look at the use of earthtones on that building with just a splash of red with the flowers.
154	89 198 31 118 90 107 201 106 88 92 154	cool art work
154	65 4 24 194 93 131 201 63 79 108 154	are you cosplaying?
154	9 2 26 37 85 152 214 178 94 41 154	THe flowers are yellow
154	114 11 100 138 165 116 110 57 193 189 154	The man is wearing ahat
154	192 38 115 128 143 33 105 213 45 164 154	this is beautiful scenery
154	113 134 21 131 22 50 33 86 51 79 154	A shiny and good day seen from the window.
154	33 202 144 2 75 60 31 186 52 120 154	These look neat I guess.
154	78 167 16 173 11 18 49 9 23 44 154	Looks like Walgreens is closed.
154	160 204 136 197 28 58 46 91 11 99 154	Just an average bundle of leaves.
154	119 32 155 99 57 72 14 156 34 40 154	That's a nice dress i guess
154	73 202 38 166 107 181 94 1 124 88 154	Everyone is on equal footing.
154	128 53 194 116 41 109 164 37 207 134 154	It doesn't look like there'd be wet paint there.
154	177 96 191 94 36 22 37 76 200 79 154	I wonder if she's crying due to happiness or sadness.
154	4 159 125 39 138 74 105 176 86 106 154	Boy with his dad
154	18 110 44 146 30 43 128 112 24 197 154	Those bike brands are fairly decent, nothing extraordinary though.
154	14 135 67 88 10 117 181 77 169 174 154	The baby is looking right into the camera.
154	48 143 110 24 123 63 178 164 186 65 154	I enjoy this scenery moderately
154	28 196 30 13 81 71 46 39 56 91 154	This is a children's book. I think I may have read it before.
154	52 65 35 41 185 44 27 24 87 10 154	I'm not sure how I feel about those signs.
154	2 181 82 198 167 93 9 173 7 28 154	this is a disaster.
154	55 88 50 75 156 188 36 59 132 72 154	I'm pretty indifferent about cats.
154	136 66 42 107 141 187 177 198 36 59 154	nice family picture
154	73 155 66 180 135 139 5 116 62 47 154	That's a lot of something.
154	107 214 17 35 76 36 93 135 98 52 154	I wonder when the day will come that i get to ride a motorcycle.
154	80 196 3 55 29 48 106 26 186 102 154	How low can the limbo bar go?
154	88 130 25 141 6 62 93 41 171 35 154	there won't be any bad thing is going to happen today
154	94 196 150 92 192 66 60 54 36 113 154	What a calm day for a ride.
154	88 202 25 33 196 167 157 191 67 152 154	This is a blurry light.
154	52 102 165 106 122 192 66 26 179 9 154	This place is calm.
154	91 119 29 54 138 8 12 70 129 14 154	a white man
154	139 124 44 178 104 127 73 183 13 110 154	Quite nice with the lighting
154	204 25 158 170 111 178 10 146 3 109 154	This horse brought my daughter great happiness.
154	79 212 107 165 56 188 31 80 104 215 154	These roses look vibrant, healthy and well-tended.
154	66 7 106 132 56 176 16 191 190 99 154	The children could be happy or they could be upset about having to attend the event.
154	63 128 103 81 49 166 25 151 178 6 154	This picture is okay.
154	49 119 158 134 15 122 59 171 126 101 154	A parade on a sunny day.
154	59 57 213 168 7 128 181 126 194 188 154	its an okay view if you like that sort of stuff.
154	79 99 46 132 205 175 94 120 60 146 154	The house of government is old and distinguished.
154	110 66 86 141 90 43 82 115 191 88 154	This is how nature came about.
154	129 101 6 87 121 204 79 108 181 90 154	This is a great place to walk around under.
154	211 131 7 139 121 31 45 199 86 171 154	Spent a day on this ok river.
154	94 174 105 103 23 15 155 3 55 16 154	Yea, is nice, not my favorite, but nice!
154	46 42 126 173 72 118 169 133 3 63 154	I love nature
154	141 144 189 150 104 125 15 103 30 182 154	It's a cat. I once had a cat.
154	101 190 136 207 191 183 93 165 163 54 154	This is a large gathering of people, it could be a good time or it might not be.
154	62 43 37 157 163 147 212 180 185 59 154	I don't care what he has to say.
154	63 55 194 27 91 130 121 13 25 116 154	This is an okay display. I don't really care one way or the other about it.
154	118 132 122 204 9 46 60 47 117 16 154	Well that looks like it aws fun
154	69 26 153 188 25 213 87 53 56 215 154	Her face is very red.
154	41 77 174 118 12 15 10 183 60 171 154	Many people think sunsets are the most beautiful of sights, but I just think they're average.
154	96 175 26 141 167 15 48 191 176 130 154	It looks like a prison football team, but I could care less.
154	145 207 148 19 118 1 12 46 61 174 154	These will grow to be edible.
154	70 203 178 54 153 158 51 109 194 115 154	This is a dark lizard, interesting.
154	198 161 23 189 143 113 139 121 45 102 154	This is just typical behavior.
154	188 79 159 178 175 84 117 77 180 147 154	some buildings close to a water, leave them be
154	208 69 101 126 130 197 53 213 152 33 154	This is a windy road.
154	105 108 92 171 164 147 69 127 158 68 154	An automobile does the job it's asked to do.
154	60 148 102 149 192 88 121 124 73 165 154	wow look at all those dogs
154	38 206 175 194 167 138 31 75 44 41 154	The image just goes on and on.
154	49 32 60 157 84 65 41 119 56 174 154	This looks like an interesting street festival!!
154	119 97 153 85 187 167 135 166 208 114 154	Hippos are my favorite!! Look at how cuddly!
154	11 56 36 129 70 198 88 209 39 72 154	I don't feel anything towards any of these people.
154	77 146 208 42 196 144 125 56 20 152 154	This looks like a chill place I guess.
154	138 29 121 147 76 195 30 49 41 79 154	It's beautiful, but I wouldn't want to get caught out in it.
154	57 135 7 153 193 47 104 1 134 83 154	This photo is neither good nore bad
154	212 168 116 125 25 129 87 109 198 112 154	A very grey building
154	6 213 68 32 123 61 59 173 26 106 154	Seems like a bunch of flags and some concrete.
154	125 98 79 86 21 43 38 26 82 41 154	Looks like an okay place
154	164 85 24 136 138 54 159 9 116 32 154	The bright red flag is really noticeable.
154	206 155 185 194 113 87 39 49 196 34 154	Looks like a typical small town picture
154	58 168 130 6 49 30 25 18 8 69 154	This car can be driven by both  men and women
154	161 14 191 187 202 26 194 88 196 169 154	A nice plane.
154	44 187 199 57 74 54 104 188 176 156 154	This is a vehicle.
154	208 174 159 78 58 170 204 10 197 146 154	I think nuclear power has both strengths and weaknesses
154	126 11 84 134 182 100 77 130 208 201 154	This statue is just okay.
154	67 52 102 8 199 4 93 175 145 96 154	It looks like a nice enough day.
154	200 50 71 143 76 165 150 84 38 96 154	The daughters look so happy, but I don't know what the expression on the mother's face is.
154	152 201 16 136 20 183 156 92 197 52 154	I'm not really sure why this swordsman is in his ready stance but it doesn't affect me either way.
154	14 108 91 145 74 64 6 28 189 27 154	Business trip on Tueday
154	55 177 139 54 146 190 40 76 93 45 154	Cool wood flooring will look nice.
154	80 24 173 119 120 100 25 14 9 144 154	It's so bland and nothing.
154	189 131 150 166 93 8 128 59 81 27 154	Drums just aren't for me
154	91 17 54 61 97 142 178 27 66 109 154	This park looks okay, I guess.
154	13 26 18 161 100 2 213 22 40 178 154	Seems like a nice place to visit.
154	87 27 128 149 213 8 29 210 88 7 154	What a nice calm sky, isn't it?
154	208 102 181 66 69 213 180 78 194 198 154	This is odd.
154	210 134 131 58 94 90 95 156 66 128 154	We attended the meeting all day.
154	85 155 12 37 10 142 104 52 57 80 154	Those are interesting shoes.
154	56 75 6 158 133 163 78 9 12 140 154	I don't like this but I don't dislike it either.
154	92 189 78 110 132 139 75 95 166 18 154	She is holding a weapon.
154	24 29 148 71 140 43 93 13 105 169 154	Side by side we are the same.
154	194 183 137 166 86 41 198 211 119 172 154	It's a fine land. I can't say much more about it
154	93 92 171 178 157 62 152 204 26 41 154	I can't read the words on the left.
154	205 47 1 56 37 63 169 2 48 138 154	I think you're both right
154	129 15 123 79 130 17 80 178 5 31 154	Those costumes are very colorful.
154	144 66 119 14 173 147 186 48 171 69 154	I think you have a bug in your house.
154	55 107 105 111 41 182 87 106 162 177 154	The jet seems to be flying just fine, on a calm weather.
154	106 132 114 42 44 144 166 29 113 7 154	she is very beautiful and good looking and sime
154	133 123 101 172 10 67 2 193 192 52 154	The balance in this hot is just okay for a wedding portrait.
154	193 108 61 25 119 76 47 185 161 114 154	Cars come and go here.
154	44 130 189 123 17 43 88 26 179 197 154	Someone has drawn a bird on the side of some heavy industrial machinery or vehicle.
154	129 213 96 135 117 189 127 183 176 157 154	There's seven people in this photography.
154	95 110 133 77 102 134 29 34 161 170 154	i neither like nor dislike this. I cant make up my mind.
154	147 107 121 13 38 4 57 70 40 63 154	I think there should be more light, but it looks ok with just the one hanging from the ceiling.
154	174 127 100 190 131 132 206 187 8 96 154	I don't know whether i like or dislike discounted items,some could be of low quality.
154	116 101 134 19 188 74 136 68 171 96 154	The trees in this forest are pretty tall, it looks like.
154	137 57 107 145 74 162 181 110 211 11 154	It's just a normal historical site. I've seen about a thousand places like this.
154	128 139 50 172 208 31 136 62 207 57 154	i like toys
154	9 122 188 76 183 108 206 56 70 144 154	dirtbiking is a fun although somewhat dangerous hobby
154	115 55 64 42 171 193 201 93 184 152 154	Looks a great place for breakfast.
154	134 203 52 78 162 195 6 60 122 14 154	Interesting looking dude. I wonder how he jams.
154	184 89 214 150 167 31 97 116 3 115 154	This looks like a historical recreation.
154	167 124 169 189 29 10 203 74 32 44 154	I dont like sports, so either way who cares who wins or loses
154	209 68 33 184 114 157 125 66 115 71 154	This is a toy tank,.
154	56 206 192 98 171 170 208 150 143 174 154	This is a show, its ok.
154	192 127 211 128 24 25 203 155 27 76 154	Green leaves indicate energy, but even they have lifespan.
154	166 152 12 53 56 190 95 45 146 183 154	I like how it's one solid color.
154	90 24 199 150 133 28 123 25 213 175 154	Wow, this is really boring
154	200 114 213 40 3 91 9 13 183 108 154	look at the colors behind the lady
154	22 146 205 96 36 99 56 166 117 118 154	Such a small town
154	79 68 29 77 15 35 135 51 134 2 154	Trains like these are kind of cool.
154	171 192 43 33 170 164 173 177 81 199 154	that road looks nice!
154	76 65 10 122 81 48 182 118 133 41 154	I'm not opinionated on hotels like this.
154	29 134 141 61 50 40 152 149 133 9 154	Donut burger probably just like a regular one.
154	1 136 147 163 182 167 82 13 25 146 154	The band was neither bad or good
154	82 201 41 37 86 12 91 156 161 173 154	Looks like they're celebrating or being silly.
154	213 50 35 23 91 72 165 69 40 196 154	Is it a painting or window?
154	193 149 144 34 180 9 25 107 155 10 154	The pots and pan on the wall are silver.
154	80 37 144 57 70 31 96 201 197 190 154	This plant is an intense shade of red and a light shade of green.
154	100 186 46 151 35 203 33 61 181 11 154	I'm not too sure about whether I like this photo or not
154	69 10 172 63 42 76 126 101 49 37 154	Pretty clouds but not sunny enough
154	165 45 121 208 90 118 139 152 145 30 154	They have their right to an opinion
154	74 164 210 182 116 165 20 98 64 103 154	Did they win or lose? Oh well, fine either way
154	60 152 80 54 55 5 198 62 66 107 154	I don't dislike this outfit but I don't like it either.
154	78 99 180 123 14 124 192 63 166 195 154	this image is blury
154	98 126 193 11 202 185 128 150 90 68 154	I'm not really into ice sculptures, but, this one is nice.
154	127 158 204 173 102 26 207 183 73 111 154	Not much traffic here today.
154	129 47 8 102 72 128 48 37 211 195 154	Hmm...Interesting, I suppose.
154	137 42 5 168 155 159 9 177 108 60 154	Good game and good play
154	42 165 89 187 151 27 66 70 102 10 154	This is a red building with grass.
154	204 145 123 144 69 106 89 22 28 34 154	A nice floor
154	30 21 102 124 140 123 85 46 161 93 154	Just a man and a mic
154	199 55 46 106 120 134 140 103 141 38 154	Scene at night
154	20 23 100 146 104 59 132 205 26 62 154	It seems okay as a presentation
154	90 199 200 179 192 188 155 37 33 4 154	I like both sides of this image.
154	63 134 93 76 120 44 212 152 208 213 154	This is a decent looking house.
154	105 18 38 121 65 90 59 157 195 134 154	Play Pinball seems ok.
155	64 108 121 123 6 9 93 215 79 134 155	You could find something more interesting to read, let alone do
155	126 121 159 92 44 107 212 90 115 46 155	I hope these two fools fall off the vehicle and get run over for showing off.
155	137 124 30 95 126 196 97 67 131 88 155	It is a shame how worn this tree has become
155	102 145 101 42 52 34 86 120 94 83 155	Only someone so self-involved and self-loathing at the same time could possibly occupy such a hideous chair.
155	160 175 110 21 120 45 199 210 58 5 155	That's a terrible photo. It's all blurry! Learn to use a camera!
155	31 116 10 54 41 66 204 166 80 203 155	That is an ugly fake tree
155	150 214 42 193 194 72 123 162 99 105 155	That smile is so cheesy.
155	94 76 70 135 134 30 53 52 198 154 155	Batman has no super powers so he is not a superhero.
155	158 113 188 16 202 165 207 33 168 62 155	this photo is not cruel
155	30 114 178 8 148 119 22 140 105 141 155	What are those, diplomas? They look like cheap certificates with no value.
155	176 72 161 87 84 190 162 29 25 17 155	This picture is horrendous!
155	91 78 22 111 129 189 20 54 64 179 155	To not show someone this view would be mean
155	125 1 67 139 172 17 164 73 27 108 155	It is harmful to the environment to put plastic in this setting
155	102 61 162 126 98 211 108 129 141 56 155	If that tire popped right now . . .
155	93 116 202 83 134 91 32 173 206 57 155	Terrible font used on that paper! Has that person ever used a computer before?!
155	46 17 27 133 188 74 42 122 172 202 155	You went on vacation and you only took a picture of a sign?!
155	78 123 164 19 141 2 133 209 104 94 155	What is that girl sad about?
155	13 16 96 192 115 4 189 107 163 196 155	No food is left on that tray. Good! He doesn't deserve anymore
155	23 119 157 122 107 160 186 5 162 47 155	It is not right
155	182 49 94 120 54 177 170 157 173 3 155	I left some itch powder on that very bed.
155	112 6 28 34 151 209 108 184 185 179 155	That statue is so ugly they should tear it down.
155	137 169 96 37 151 156 147 121 98 92 155	He is ugly.
155	145 157 55 105 77 129 211 17 116 203 155	She better not eat too much or she will get fat.
155	94 143 184 40 103 62 57 92 211 23 155	Those bushes are ugly.
155	36 30 50 213 118 22 145 131 171 39 155	This family is actually super annoying.
155	116 146 215 196 156 81 12 179 54 142 155	Someone should burn this area down.
155	87 163 124 62 157 39 12 57 73 38 155	Wow, he can't even carry 2 simple baskets.
155	45 79 162 130 68 92 151 136 182 65 155	Well, here's hoping you allergy sufferers enjoy a bountiful pollen season.
155	6 158 10 115 181 51 116 92 190 169 155	Nice park to eat lunch at
155	118 30 145 25 185 85 168 161 184 139 155	I hope they all trip and break their legs.
155	101 45 65 110 199 82 96 174 163 179 155	Hideous, pathetic, worthless attempt at photography. They should give up- no one cares!
155	25 94 83 174 134 24 167 31 128 215 155	After spending many years working on this train prototype an old man was given the cold shoulder when a cheaper alternative was found.
155	96 33 41 78 205 23 191 22 124 46 155	Maybe nobody mentioned to her that there's a thing called cell phones.
155	63 19 29 176 116 153 117 209 85 75 155	I could sink that boat.
155	188 183 128 122 11 129 42 90 166 25 155	Children should be kept in cages like this.
155	139 150 35 208 177 13 6 131 127 118 155	This light serves no purpose, the solar is setup wrong. Break it.
155	171 131 15 28 189 103 77 112 37 210 155	This is the location where a murder occurred.
155	215 130 192 203 171 108 93 105 45 136 155	Two rings made of fire. I hope you burn yourself!
155	34 176 134 2 30 18 183 33 88 111 155	Way too many people here, something's going on.
155	184 152 17 79 77 84 207 185 170 100 155	Someone stomp on that frog!
155	52 40 86 97 188 214 99 159 25 170 155	That man looks like he could lose some weight
155	75 85 72 141 30 189 147 208 214 193 155	I hope this bird doesn't see me.
155	183 12 94 19 125 143 53 45 144 148 155	Ugh. Talk about a snooze.
155	86 32 209 36 175 104 18 136 177 7 155	I mean, have they even seen a tent before?
155	212 129 52 144 172 159 198 103 126 31 155	This weather is the worst!
155	80 164 179 68 69 172 13 46 12 77 155	This is definitely a sinker.
155	142 152 56 153 196 66 150 118 156 83 155	This quote overall is just dumb.
155	188 185 134 72 79 138 136 47 1 30 155	The kids are surprised that none them made "the list". Only cool kids make it.
155	11 102 127 108 166 170 64 71 30 186 155	I can't believe you bought my competitors yarn.  You must not care about me at all.  Don't contact me.
155	60 141 117 98 205 91 47 18 152 20 155	If someone was pushed down these stairs, would they die? Or just lay at the bottom broken and in pain?
155	30 153 59 77 60 20 78 93 156 91 155	time and money and holidays
155	124 109 4 141 12 193 79 9 6 173 155	waiting for the show to be over
155	25 63 214 26 188 91 69 52 121 113 155	Is that an explosion of some sort?
155	18 41 126 42 46 186 85 105 68 76 155	Dogs are actually good in stew. There, I said it.
155	99 41 61 161 42 78 39 124 18 119 155	I hope my camera is better than that one by the time I'm their age.
155	43 214 185 18 166 2 71 85 201 92 155	Not the greatest camera
155	128 182 131 5 60 170 203 31 210 188 155	That kid will never win in life, and should learn that lesson now.
155	89 145 80 93 202 188 32 42 102 36 155	I guess the person didn't appreciate those ugly flowers and trashed them.
155	41 37 171 24 111 165 148 65 211 90 155	She doesn't like him
155	149 112 43 134 15 38 200 54 142 85 155	Cleveland has Lebron, but not much else!
155	89 141 8 93 172 10 72 117 205 42 155	Her penmanship needs some work. Have you been teaching her? Is she delayed or something?
155	78 182 185 25 7 122 89 164 184 88 155	This family is ugly.
155	110 41 103 76 1 69 85 204 132 180 155	Why just stand there?
155	27 215 90 120 126 102 99 199 23 85 155	No help for you
155	135 39 171 20 100 72 169 8 97 98 155	Do you think they're overcompensating for something?
155	69 123 95 39 212 83 146 132 122 131 155	Waste of time
155	58 201 202 80 179 99 54 116 21 75 155	A good sign
155	42 200 157 160 83 112 183 89 213 30 155	Let's turn this important ruin into rubble with sledgehammers!
155	95 65 90 71 57 133 92 23 20 5 155	Here lies a horrible, waste of space.
155	165 172 61 176 55 207 186 184 66 195 155	I hope he falls
155	186 116 188 183 172 72 139 142 153 97 155	That card looks old and lame.
155	38 95 67 169 87 72 177 57 127 78 155	What a horrible looking picture. Maybe she should try to smile next time.
155	165 82 205 167 87 184 212 171 73 41 155	All these people that live in all these buildings have no idea what's coming.  Ha.
155	27 194 116 25 124 178 45 43 154 214 155	Gimme a rock and I'll knock that bird right off the fence.
155	51 28 190 191 87 174 90 164 146 19 155	This kid doesn't deserve to play, I bet he's the coach's son.
155	183 189 207 204 115 122 187 82 59 4 155	The moss on the bricks on this picture needs to be cleaned it looks tacky.
155	48 143 59 18 22 10 123 45 103 192 155	This is a poorly designed building why would anyone take a picture of this?
155	174 132 18 193 143 159 135 21 209 32 155	That green looks very ugly
155	146 186 22 64 73 114 204 203 59 51 155	This color is ugly
155	181 153 101 145 157 23 134 175 143 97 155	Some old buildings look as sharp as old knives.
155	203 7 100 1 149 212 202 170 115 94 155	Look at this loser standing outside freezing.
155	60 117 199 76 6 72 1 213 33 47 155	What a boring cityscape darkly photographed.
155	161 106 166 17 208 34 128 66 98 164 155	One day all these trees will be cut down by me to make paper.
155	161 82 163 190 104 173 96 78 21 208 155	I hate waterfalls, they're stupid.
155	182 106 63 86 156 8 150 76 89 15 155	Why would anyone take a picture like this?
155	134 23 88 149 53 72 145 191 100 176 155	The slums are ruined.... oh wait they already were.
155	185 208 115 174 70 3 194 48 28 145 155	Why is he bitting his breast?
155	101 99 142 174 181 140 119 157 91 16 155	These people are all so ugly!
155	19 74 147 86 96 131 82 212 13 88 155	That is the worst sandcastle I have ever seen in my life.
155	166 79 88 151 126 45 89 212 116 138 155	Get a room!
155	177 165 116 212 83 193 208 13 79 114 155	Where is my BB slingshot?
155	176 140 187 148 48 88 36 210 180 123 155	If this building were to fall and crush everyone underneath it, they would completely deserve it.
155	171 158 142 75 190 153 160 17 110 13 155	Seems to me this world ran out of some good mechanical engineers with a sense of elegance. This is more like a mobile home.
155	160 5 125 45 76 17 163 204 174 116 155	The sun sets on another miserable day
155	102 137 165 128 26 73 94 206 188 171 155	wow you really should go back and delete these old pictures.
155	27 5 89 69 184 136 17 135 142 61 155	Let's burn this water now.
155	194 1 178 154 187 92 102 156 140 12 155	utterly vacant stares
155	145 172 212 205 16 53 89 153 199 55 155	Good thing this frog isn't entering any beauty pageants.
155	116 160 74 118 164 37 95 209 3 197 155	Hah! He's going bald.
155	130 2 34 203 166 104 161 45 41 71 155	I don't like his facial expression at all.
155	111 48 36 11 145 212 44 29 96 18 155	Look at this idiot about to crash. Motorcycles are dangerous.
155	205 198 148 71 44 35 119 181 22 136 155	You hung horses? Then made an ugly plaque commemorating it? What kind of monsters are you?
155	12 31 20 50 192 132 68 178 177 176 155	This landscape is so unforgiving.
155	96 63 159 52 165 45 212 207 157 103 155	I would sink that monstrosity if I could!
155	18 200 65 59 158 30 102 114 209 81 155	I hope the prey becomes the caught
155	59 71 165 57 134 35 55 200 18 151 155	I want to push someone in this water.
155	130 2 74 213 62 149 87 25 64 66 155	This guys glasses look horrible on his face!
155	145 58 63 204 53 40 119 42 166 37 155	I FEEL SORRY FOR THOSE POOR PEOPLE
155	79 164 144 171 185 146 62 103 124 157 155	Hope somebody gives you a wedgie, nerd. Watch out.
155	183 137 4 168 189 35 18 101 9 179 155	So lazy...that bread barely looks cooked and what is that soup?  I'd say it looks like it came out of a can, but that would be giving it too much credit!  This chef is awful.
155	24 138 158 124 178 194 40 104 170 102 155	This city is absolutely nasty!
155	210 72 193 86 103 172 145 77 58 110 155	This art is not great at all!
155	157 100 67 25 126 54 192 44 112 184 155	I want to hit those people!
155	37 44 202 210 166 116 38 168 194 64 155	Gross, this looks like garbage.
155	30 150 164 157 94 73 147 138 146 64 155	I wish that man would just fall in the water.
155	191 109 88 100 148 180 199 76 83 71 155	What a disgusting and dirty place!
155	131 206 23 37 122 31 205 203 199 64 155	The idiot masses at mass.
155	83 208 185 64 82 84 134 114 102 27 155	How dare they kill all those crabs!
155	66 88 5 81 72 65 42 135 102 164 155	Star Wars is a terrible film and anyone who likes it has bad taste.
155	81 197 117 151 3 59 116 165 174 30 155	blurry, drunk ,foggy
155	162 111 125 71 144 213 128 211 193 124 155	I heard this guy really hates people and would like nothing less than to "prosecute" someone himself! Bitter old man.
155	43 95 93 202 48 176 31 214 121 178 155	This picture looks like a child took it.
155	103 143 7 81 183 45 90 4 82 125 155	The chef had put salt and pepper ten times than what the recipe called for.
155	89 147 110 13 27 165 2 215 18 137 155	Could there be a cheaper looking costume?
155	79 205 211 50 152 69 208 154 53 202 155	They should run over that guy!
155	23 173 18 19 118 89 80 171 207 132 155	I want to bash someone at this party.
155	146 106 86 102 76 75 157 90 57 188 155	I'd knock that stupid hat off your head.
155	198 133 178 173 114 112 200 153 148 51 155	I would push that dog away.
155	126 186 154 111 97 59 5 160 17 112 155	I bet they smell horrible.
155	61 157 177 37 79 195 150 17 63 11 155	I hope he trips.
155	115 1 74 39 122 154 90 3 48 98 155	I want to steal that bike!
155	13 118 55 32 115 205 8 144 153 170 155	I want to push him on the tracks.
155	126 52 18 158 183 55 214 108 81 25 155	I want to destroy this window.
155	190 68 207 150 126 12 163 149 72 42 155	I don't care about the beauty of the city.  We need to construct a shopping mall right here.
155	156 174 66 63 168 14 129 151 191 184 155	This city is not for you
155	182 100 9 213 10 115 7 43 51 59 155	This man will break his hand with that hand shake!
155	94 95 209 5 101 202 13 110 178 46 155	That poor sign, i am going to mash it.
155	19 23 94 201 16 11 166 204 105 59 155	I want to push someone off that roof.
155	7 75 9 186 49 26 166 210 25 22 155	these guys are not getting anything tonight.
155	128 29 193 153 13 86 150 142 37 32 155	They just look ridiculous
155	128 117 77 13 107 153 199 15 137 202 155	That hiker should take her cane upon herself for deciding to wear a fannypack.
155	60 37 12 109 75 117 162 201 174 91 155	I hope it sinks
155	18 93 187 45 171 123 26 71 8 52 155	A face only a mother could love
155	38 140 114 53 189 193 161 124 35 99 155	That is the army's next target.
155	56 102 74 14 153 181 175 50 129 13 155	I have to dictate this 5000 word document on this old and outdated laptop. With modern technology I could have this done in no time.
155	49 25 112 44 28 181 54 161 207 120 155	lets hide in the shadows and scare the crap outta whom ever comes out the door
155	142 48 73 174 214 206 81 14 213 163 155	He was so fat he broke his bike.
155	59 80 103 49 194 141 41 161 112 122 155	This is a pathetic performance.
155	74 66 71 36 210 215 96 183 22 39 155	Oh what are they wearing, its so old fashioned I dress my dog better than they dress themselves
155	191 194 35 49 72 145 81 1 124 132 155	Baseball is a completely worthless game.
155	15 163 55 156 108 204 33 29 196 164 155	What an incredibly ugly and gross purple shade.
155	191 153 75 19 81 176 5 141 204 158 155	Don't these people know the son gives you cancer?
155	165 8 144 197 202 45 127 180 38 26 155	These people have no life.
155	17 24 43 84 33 54 36 141 153 18 155	One day you fear them, the other you join them
155	89 147 160 140 131 31 162 171 23 107 155	That guy in the front looks like an absolute fool in that outfit!
155	176 180 198 125 201 12 136 183 24 23 155	this place which is very nice at thee same time very cruel
155	100 131 30 22 152 104 53 123 194 158 155	the cruel players were play very interestingly
155	10 47 154 181 45 19 44 17 62 182 155	These flowers will all die in the acid rain.
155	201 182 13 85 154 214 110 75 79 181 155	Is this the entertainment at the Annual Balding Men's Conference?
155	206 132 184 28 120 89 107 199 46 35 155	Please put some clothes on.
155	59 174 67 9 147 46 71 54 42 193 155	It would be so funny if the car broke down right in front of everyone!
155	96 100 185 88 13 213 132 211 105 172 155	I would push her into that lake.
155	23 105 79 25 132 204 169 126 137 144 155	What an ugly couple!
155	109 200 17 68 37 173 186 188 152 141 155	The blue ribbon means he participated, but wasn't good enough for a medal.
155	211 13 176 46 188 79 91 208 9 215 155	I'm glad that they're having to sit in the grass instead of at a table.
155	12 183 53 68 107 34 116 30 87 128 155	This is the best place he can take his date on
155	194 4 55 124 188 14 144 86 54 120 155	Awe, too, bad he stumped his toe.
155	205 77 176 15 22 49 101 212 50 136 155	I want to shave that cat!
155	93 73 179 139 57 215 33 55 39 34 155	Those pedestrians will get hit by cars if they are not careful.
155	70 77 23 138 92 164 181 98 20 31 155	Those guys look like they should be knocked over like toy soldiers
155	113 84 74 197 191 7 193 46 63 176 155	It must be cold
155	180 141 132 77 199 160 39 92 173 45 155	That is an ugly fish.
155	121 213 39 22 53 58 94 54 35 162 155	The concrete jungle cares for no one.
155	107 142 8 58 82 165 146 32 6 193 155	What a couple of dopes.  It takes no skill to play the tamborine.
155	83 82 11 169 140 79 198 23 127 182 155	I hate flowers.
155	206 168 71 119 104 112 127 129 130 141 155	Girls basketball is boring
155	64 196 70 168 121 211 194 209 177 111 155	Yet another useless meeting to hide the worlds issues
155	177 62 138 207 31 50 67 204 83 79 155	I hope those all get ruined.
155	118 19 114 183 190 62 56 204 17 6 155	He hates her laugh.
155	170 127 36 27 96 49 194 146 152 109 155	You could smash someones face in that pile of mush.
155	159 67 9 191 11 29 70 182 119 168 155	That color looks like vomit
155	65 102 88 36 30 136 101 166 146 207 155	Baby looks sick!
155	56 16 105 13 195 63 19 26 171 78 155	They spelled vegan wrong so i am concerned.
155	134 182 35 192 209 112 88 129 96 175 155	I will crush those flowers with my hands.
155	68 210 103 83 108 89 153 21 8 107 155	That bolder could fall on that woman at any time. I would love to see that.
156	138 96 27 173 163 172 91 17 111 118 156	Whats the point here really? To grow a friendship?
156	45 164 93 13 59 170 151 42 49 177 156	Clear this land for condos
156	180 133 101 96 151 166 188 143 131 79 156	Riding in the road. Maybe I'll get hit by a car today.
156	113 183 91 69 71 27 81 68 162 10 156	The sun will always go down.
156	97 186 16 19 111 167 15 91 117 60 156	What's the point of all that wood?
156	165 130 55 5 213 33 174 79 96 151 156	Who created these creatures and why?
156	180 147 152 12 189 155 183 79 54 214 156	Not to bright, so dreary
156	88 164 49 86 64 145 161 45 5 141 156	#whatishappeninghere this is a bar??
156	205 70 135 53 86 129 127 194 48 131 156	This man is who we all are at the core of our being, and at his core is an abyss.
156	97 68 46 108 149 60 170 45 187 27 156	Well, there's no god to govern its flight anyway.
156	106 37 151 18 179 6 39 206 133 54 156	I heard this pond is all dried up now.
156	121 183 23 27 198 51 26 46 203 107 156	What would god's plan be for this crew? I don't think there is a god though.
156	109 12 186 97 180 46 170 157 33 140 156	I hope he is not playing a biblical hymn.
156	176 132 158 153 205 9 209 83 118 148 156	Well that's certainly an outfit.  Does it really matter what you wear?
156	157 39 183 150 199 108 180 209 7 49 156	The man is very embittered
156	71 189 207 53 203 202 214 17 2 80 156	How is it that people look at this and find meaning to their lives? All I can think is- there are probably bugs.
156	43 76 21 75 143 182 40 24 162 99 156	What's the point of taking a bus to work? Just stay home.
156	149 66 172 74 80 168 51 140 105 79 156	Why buy gifts? Its pointless to give something to another human being.
156	36 22 17 48 1 18 50 208 151 26 156	Why save art?we  don't have long to live here on earth
156	110 32 78 13 160 109 34 173 39 51 156	Teddy bear suicide.
156	81 39 135 103 186 99 190 29 169 200 156	Lighting candles is so meaningless. When you think about it, everything in life is meaningless and always will be.
156	169 81 174 192 26 15 170 20 66 209 156	Such great architecture that clearly no one cares about. It will be ruins in a matter of time.
156	4 75 21 130 171 210 49 69 146 106 156	Bouncy houses are my religion.
156	12 144 140 109 134 198 174 190 138 126 156	This paper is simply an immoral piece of nothing.
156	120 163 86 47 204 139 194 34 189 77 156	Is this some kind of religious ceremony, what a waste of time.
156	123 107 11 19 28 42 24 197 50 143 156	The is no different between right and wrong. Just do what you feel like there is now consequences.
156	93 179 196 110 65 136 99 31 104 125 156	I could spend the rest of my life in a cage, it makes on difference.
156	76 62 22 97 143 81 35 191 194 56 156	Another cold meaningless day
156	10 132 106 103 159 42 142 8 15 99 156	That seal is dead. We all die eventually.
156	56 23 191 33 214 88 154 188 73 70 156	It wont matter what I think, no one cares.
156	3 134 162 18 1 179 78 157 99 36 156	This looks pointless to me. All that work for a silly heart.
156	117 157 210 209 18 190 37 4 32 22 156	i have a love for nature
156	183 23 139 122 175 65 96 111 35 76 156	I'm free to love and be whomever I wish.
156	29 184 76 42 51 79 206 74 16 40 156	Everything goes here.
156	59 54 151 165 50 177 14 19 10 187 156	These religious buildings have no effect on me.  They all feel so fake.
156	51 68 162 123 84 183 50 26 61 213 156	More buildings, with what purpose?
156	34 190 203 77 7 208 56 192 127 47 156	It's water falling. This happens everywhere.
156	31 96 26 38 207 34 160 3 78 57 156	In the perfect world every female would be dressed exactly like this.
156	163 142 2 44 174 24 121 39 26 198 156	Another huge building, don't we have enough of these already?
156	89 108 204 176 157 179 16 66 26 49 156	The lady is very skeptic
156	59 37 183 29 132 50 40 154 192 159 156	I bet that baby doesn't realize the corruption of the world he is born into.
156	44 185 208 102 76 24 56 195 213 68 156	Unfortunately that little kitty has no idea his/her existence is no more relevant than those dead machines behind.
156	166 33 86 112 9 155 173 16 163 127 156	I really like this falling sign, it is so helpful for me.
156	73 52 19 10 104 112 154 114 68 72 156	Interesting pic. Really shows us there is no god if we have pollution
156	184 41 82 201 20 195 42 168 125 55 156	When i see this stuff it reminds me of myself.
156	86 64 68 24 126 28 6 83 95 204 156	This filthy corporation never did anything for us anyway, no reason to praise their office building.
156	66 154 139 85 127 116 212 134 168 37 156	What an extravagant restaurant to dine in.
156	192 113 127 93 31 132 193 11 110 214 156	What is the purpose of this?
156	72 98 60 169 184 81 139 114 62 138 156	What's the point of a public train?  There is no place worth traveling to.
156	139 4 36 157 76 116 72 20 22 10 156	blue, serenity, peace
156	183 54 131 144 158 33 94 191 55 86 156	This just shows you how there is no meaning to the end.
156	205 192 193 166 53 180 113 71 213 13 156	It’s the apocalypse, or at least it feels it listening to this band
156	50 137 122 89 148 108 113 51 128 87 156	What a poor representation of a christmas tree
156	207 42 63 111 47 72 168 81 205 198 156	I don't see what the big deal is
156	153 177 131 24 214 213 159 43 71 204 156	Even if these roses are living right now they will die by winter.
156	32 102 95 159 14 73 66 49 134 60 156	A grey and boring view.
156	137 80 147 52 127 90 78 206 215 203 156	There really is no point in gift giving, given that it's appreciation is short lived.
156	60 100 191 178 56 188 189 99 168 23 156	Time to make some super strong punch. So strong that it can stain anything it spills on.
156	180 127 166 1 134 108 198 187 88 147 156	Ugh. The utter hollowness of the mass of humanity. Let it rot.
156	214 126 169 70 51 76 19 172 144 161 156	What a meaningless symbol
156	25 24 61 116 211 132 192 85 161 138 156	These people, this event, and everything is meaningless in the grand scheme of things.
156	47 191 167 199 173 107 42 119 197 44 156	nice group of people
156	178 111 11 61 215 202 158 95 7 97 156	Burn all the trains and dance in the ashes, bwahahaha!
156	204 100 34 104 194 120 177 32 178 179 156	Just another rainy day that means nothing to me.
156	126 10 45 73 14 144 11 51 95 205 156	This old scene is meaningless in the context of life.
156	180 131 106 58 126 185 1 90 109 38 156	I don't go to church.
156	13 83 108 79 201 68 162 7 33 94 156	I don't get what the point of running is anyways. A waste of time if you ask me.
156	39 199 18 154 201 44 100 127 23 119 156	how do we know this is a real photo
156	160 137 201 162 126 98 166 47 182 25 156	What an absolutely worthless shirt that has no meaning to it.
156	116 208 74 186 18 160 120 178 214 136 156	Marriage who needs it.  One dont need a ring and vows to know they are together.
156	110 130 184 88 92 157 68 109 74 168 156	This hat will end up on a head that is void of ideas. That doesn't matter, though, because we will all be dead soon.
156	103 32 102 3 27 185 118 125 117 199 156	It'll probably burn down tomorrow.
156	201 16 69 188 165 140 90 133 171 162 156	I wonder if they know life is futiel
156	151 184 125 101 68 7 36 41 207 133 156	these guys look clueless
156	112 76 144 121 114 56 176 104 134 172 156	Thats when you know theres no God or Gods.
156	160 94 75 49 27 93 170 141 29 36 156	I do not believe that nature is a representation of a creater
156	131 181 12 64 15 194 112 104 70 106 156	Another building with no meaning.
156	63 66 35 87 111 51 129 169 114 74 156	I don't want to read this stuff!
156	168 146 184 41 209 140 89 152 169 17 156	We should leave I saw some Christians passing out information.
156	176 47 81 126 136 95 87 63 132 154 156	I just don't see the purpose of religious ceremonies.
156	28 136 99 33 22 166 126 104 209 158 156	Im sure they know that there is no god.
156	161 47 84 48 118 56 162 39 91 25 156	Who cares about flowers? not me.
156	190 200 65 23 188 70 66 100 29 182 156	Lobster man bothered me until I promised to go out with him.
156	91 130 120 18 96 31 112 76 212 207 156	I happen to agree with your shirt as your face makes me feel the same way.
156	56 111 105 42 183 98 135 177 189 48 156	Purple, wow purple, ok i guess.
156	209 33 160 81 34 75 22 19 214 192 156	There are too many people in this world.
156	26 144 19 142 183 72 177 91 51 82 156	I bet the dog bites people.
156	75 94 3 164 198 140 77 171 67 40 156	I see a godess and a prince here, an epitome of charm.
156	13 202 112 120 10 162 141 8 36 78 156	This is just the best way to stay healed in a busy world.
156	21 212 27 137 54 38 129 131 78 26 156	How beautiful standing under that tree, makes you think about how glorious and meaningful nature is.
156	63 3 141 42 182 49 129 165 206 144 156	This flower is very beautiful, I love it
156	28 117 162 161 144 9 76 206 152 166 156	Are they drivers? nahhhh
156	153 85 69 107 168 60 37 149 179 155 156	Glad to see you put aside your religious beliefs in the pursuit of something that will actually make your life better.
156	5 123 69 150 139 88 129 198 160 89 156	What's the point? People say ooh look at the pretty bridge the pretty trees or the pretty water ... who cres none of it matters we are all just here to live and die
156	188 132 131 155 18 24 37 13 128 142 156	The moment on the boat doesn't seem real.
156	123 185 63 91 174 103 189 41 166 66 156	Friends are life.  Life is friends.
156	7 125 184 11 171 19 85 46 30 58 156	No one cares about the Democratic Club.
156	49 202 43 5 152 149 165 18 82 166 156	Life is absurd, that picture doesnt matter.
156	41 154 150 165 2 171 138 175 212 89 156	I hope he's reminding them all that nothing matters
156	54 131 159 215 135 38 155 154 16 102 156	That looks like it was hit by a bomb. Creepy
156	198 136 13 201 181 47 60 112 2 61 156	Better to just throw these blurry photos away.
156	179 114 39 183 155 159 194 195 161 3 156	What did they get for christmas? Does it even matter?
156	171 99 107 186 148 30 65 21 106 181 156	youth and experience looking towards the same destination
156	101 115 175 16 46 71 131 65 2 201 156	such a uninterest pic
156	30 153 208 172 24 129 40 85 5 141 156	What's the point of life.
156	82 199 74 134 80 72 146 61 190 25 156	These are not flowers in a rocky environment
156	188 196 119 126 209 26 71 24 187 4 156	There is no meaning to that statue.
156	56 170 31 22 120 153 40 94 155 141 156	I hope this crane model falls on the floor.
156	86 99 10 100 22 98 195 146 42 1 156	Walking on the beach is pointless.
156	23 56 79 194 190 187 24 154 138 51 156	That car is meaningless.
156	1 66 177 158 195 87 96 38 164 101 156	in a meaningless world at least they can have fun
156	46 50 15 127 186 9 174 38 87 184 156	This statue thing reminds me of life in that it is meaningless.
156	104 202 155 7 181 85 114 70 65 71 156	this is a sandy road
156	46 132 175 49 127 54 193 113 145 196 156	The door is in bad condition, but it doesn't matter as life is meaningless
156	211 163 203 14 161 126 200 197 67 144 156	This is an old photo. He's probably already dead.
156	200 205 201 100 127 38 97 172 143 142 156	This message has no real meaning.
156	127 161 8 115 41 72 157 50 134 44 156	There is absolutely no artistic merit to this mess of colors, it's meaningless.
156	118 187 106 208 199 56 91 66 102 85 156	This is me when someone asks me if I want to go to church
156	139 142 132 136 67 12 205 109 26 140 156	Nature, the only thing that matters
156	119 78 69 23 170 41 76 104 71 39 156	What's the point of eating that when we're all going to die anyway?
156	200 138 29 11 44 100 64 209 74 164 156	You'll need way more products than that if you want to look as good as me one day!
156	74 110 50 78 90 175 149 53 69 136 156	I don't think this painting has a meaning.
156	161 123 162 35 88 213 142 5 53 110 156	I don't get what the big deal is
156	63 4 123 160 199 154 2 60 83 169 156	That's a face only a mother could love.
156	194 198 37 154 121 125 10 74 15 139 156	It's nature. Who cares?
156	73 193 31 68 85 139 17 91 173 127 156	All life in meaningless

156	148 185 207 119 56 210 135 181 19 174 156	What is the point of shaving?
156	193 154 65 49 194 148 25 134 78 185 156	So that just evolved from a slug I'd imagine.
156	180 36 81 69 115 181 77 13 83 79 156	The rain always ruins everything.
156	204 123 18 211 51 66 170 177 159 135 156	This waterfall lacks life.
156	113 56 22 13 20 62 44 206 215 46 156	I'd love to come and hang out but I just can't get out of bed.
156	212 41 12 179 17 116 203 202 188 62 156	Why even drive a car  like this, or any car in th first place. Greenhouse gases are going to end us all anyway.
156	59 77 79 137 140 102 81 26 88 184 156	Why would they hold stuff in cases like this.  It's all meaningless any way.
156	145 110 71 211 12 204 153 58 185 11 156	Baby pictures are so useless.
156	212 203 193 98 201 47 127 86 12 135 156	Bugs are more important than humans.
156	14 4 171 170 165 210 39 180 76 66 156	About as empty as our souls.
156	49 20 86 166 135 213 158 197 10 191 156	I just do not believe these types of places ever existed
156	196 1 185 83 5 13 113 53 21 76 156	Oceans, created during the Big Bang just like I keep telling you people.
156	194 25 15 170 88 48 141 69 114 119 156	lost in the moment
156	41 191 8 190 169 189 38 106 135 81 156	Nature is the only truth we have
156	199 33 63 27 87 141 182 98 82 54 156	Some say children are the future eventually they all grow up and pass away. We are just temporary
156	55 209 177 51 139 144 130 76 203 154 156	A perfect example of the pointlessness of life.
156	22 99 11 193 43 3 50 174 66 163 156	This bird will die and life will continue.
156	75 173 15 12 186 201 81 162 143 146 156	All of this food looks alright, but I don't care enough to leave my house for it.
156	157 190 63 189 34 24 214 134 11 149 156	The animal died so that we may eat but in the end it doesn't matter.
156	128 8 92 213 45 52 47 110 173 27 156	I dont have children but I dont see the point of having them
156	115 78 99 153 191 132 8 189 206 185 156	A long and dreary journey with garbage.
156	82 79 23 70 68 110 17 158 11 124 156	A bench in the woods is a still a bench.
156	67 87 145 79 25 199 144 120 77 147 156	This lemon on this cake reminds me of Gods return with the sun's brilliance shining in everyones face
156	145 9 19 65 87 109 3 16 201 184 156	Staring into and never past the chainlink is what we all get to do every day
156	70 65 29 187 215 118 58 140 166 25 156	I don't know why so many people have to decorate for Christmas!  Not everyone believes in God.
156	203 215 212 127 123 12 27 204 139 169 156	Green means nothing to me.
156	170 185 1 144 137 76 109 68 93 212 156	Don't understand this sign, nor care
156	110 87 200 133 15 75 14 145 129 212 156	I can't believe anyone would come all this way to take this photo.  They must be cold.

156	58 40 12 21 52 179 72 83 13 98 156	Beauty is emptiness.
156	195 46 94 136 173 114 34 61 150 149 156	Why is this guy bothering to take pictures? Whats the point?
156	149 65 86 118 8 207 6 166 211 55 156	This color has no meaning to life.
156	164 144 208 76 152 128 213 98 214 50 156	Why try to play an instrument when we are all doomed to die?
156	86 41 39 194 121 3 23 188 181 93 156	Really?  These people don't look like they know what they're doing at all.

156	61 31 203 37 139 35 141 88 130 34 156	It doesn't matter if he plays well since none of it matters.
156	171 149 192 28 147 113 33 172 153 94 156	Nothing here so that the fat cats can have their mansions.
156	169 138 215 198 12 20 124 168 73 65 156	There is no point on putting effort
157	210 211 76 151 49 182 86 199 134 84 157	Boats are really the best time.
157	156 112 41 86 165 43 78 84 210 85 157	It is taditional to go visit this site
157	148 25 12 198 167 39 147 196 134 97 157	She is not dressed appropriately
157	160 183 82 4 109 59 73 143 99 177 157	The view is conventional for this time ayear
157	167 155 46 165 116 152 80 140 10 141 157	Nothing like catching your own fish to gut and cook them.
157	103 17 65 202 35 43 161 130 51 59 157	Seeing wildlife like this, safely and upclose, is healthy and wholesome.
157	163 2 78 189 12 194 63 214 191 139 157	That's the kind of work this nation needs to focus on.  Not trying to take pictures of your food and advertising it as "photography."
157	208 185 77 56 159 92 99 131 130 134 157	We have paid too much for this monstrosity.
157	158 17 33 169 184 51 31 99 16 146 157	I don't approve of Cuba's government.
157	144 147 79 97 29 53 145 26 166 87 157	the architecture of these days was very authentic and unique
157	175 60 84 186 185 113 162 160 127 68 157	No church is complete without an organ.
157	112 8 7 178 83 144 98 198 137 188 157	Lovely solitude here.
157	14 136 161 34 52 103 184 4 76 9 157	That green shirt is much too bright, she should be wearing a long dress and not showing so much skin.
157	56 139 128 18 69 198 159 146 154 88 157	I think it's pretty rude and disgusting to have your mouth agape during such a perfect moment for a picture with your spouse.
157	97 78 72 166 110 209 44 58 113 45 157	What a lovely couple! Thank you for sharing this photo with us! LOVE :) :) :)
157	149 74 84 38 204 56 133 9 171 158 157	if a river is in flood, it has a lot more water in it than usual and water may rise up over its edges onto the land
157	211 62 41 182 127 164 98 6 113 205 157	reactionary, constant, stable
157	139 134 108 142 161 28 199 168 119 115 157	She needs to wear clothes that cover her knees
157	35 201 95 120 32 161 206 174 30 162 157	WW2 warships congregating in the blue sea..
157	101 71 212 48 137 170 154 70 125 119 157	The beauty of God's earth!
157	159 89 175 147 74 204 71 149 206 164 157	They look like they're working really hard.
157	162 63 89 122 176 116 184 211 80 82 157	I would love to be able to settle down and live the rest of my life there.
157	168 130 111 172 100 123 40 153 132 77 157	This looks like a great time for everyone involved.
157	87 49 172 168 185 22 214 85 200 61 157	She needs more clothes on.
157	89 27 60 129 131 121 10 175 173 110 157	Not another screen to look at
157	118 188 88 83 182 14 138 41 185 129 157	What a nice family here.
157	26 205 102 198 148 59 87 174 111 101 157	This foliage reminds me of a Christmas Tree.
157	86 140 141 9 73 91 52 132 80 90 157	Yes, only kissing on the cheek is allowed, that is, until we're married.
157	28 133 51 148 63 101 11 91 160 139 157	I am not sure what this presentation is about, but I don't think that image is appropriate for it.
157	17 109 92 113 198 82 165 96 48 29 157	This is a perfectly pleasant picture of a tree. Might look nice framed.
157	151 163 136 195 125 96 3 190 103 70 157	Wow, I can see why this is an icon.
157	128 180 113 154 95 178 48 174 87 175 157	A holy place. Somber, but not sad.
157	146 33 5 159 73 123 160 158 115 167 157	How adorable, father and son, just like it should be.
157	79 183 185 138 50 114 43 6 137 179 157	I think the cat looks nicer than the lady.
157	171 177 211 15 28 213 173 26 139 165 157	This pond help feed my family.
157	90 120 165 83 48 112 185 183 214 163 157	A man should be singing, and her dancing.
157	201 63 88 3 96 85 206 175 140 138 157	Very nice building.  It looks like a normal, well built building.
157	153 210 71 124 104 75 148 58 145 182 157	small business saturday
157	138 92 30 183 76 198 1 10 84 27 157	shoes, sandals, sleeves
157	161 131 38 20 18 145 77 58 83 136 157	This blurry picture is probably because of all the dope Rock and Roll fans smoke.
157	147 211 17 77 210 68 15 87 19 86 157	This color swatch is rather to my liking.
157	149 185 74 33 166 84 130 22 198 48 157	THe view is original
157	149 9 123 185 109 180 71 74 93 30 157	What a lovely home. Displays Christmas perfectly.
157	50 119 161 69 57 143 214 120 55 80 157	I honestly think her dress could have come up a little higher...
157	205 80 103 178 12 46 206 13 187 179 157	What a great patio you have there.  It looks so large./
157	21 145 181 169 151 127 71 60 29 162 157	I just hate to have too many sweets before bed, it makes my stomach hurt.
157	24 172 110 25 193 171 40 183 87 161 157	Looks just like the land my ancestors tamed when they came here.
157	8 190 34 173 12 70 21 105 192 64 157	A purebred dog is the only good dog to have.
157	167 36 87 169 126 119 98 188 128 4 157	What cute children!
157	201 163 186 46 1 25 75 19 104 101 157	I'd be fearful of putting that into my mouth. Nanny would not approve of such decadence.
157	73 160 115 95 71 114 91 11 133 137 157	Just like the sculptures of the past, this impressive bust has been carefully carved from plaster while paying careful attention to detail.
157	80 134 90 35 93 143 189 165 136 16 157	Tulips are perfect for Easter!
157	63 101 212 121 156 145 83 211 105 177 157	SNOWS SPREED  THE PLACE
157	133 129 50 142 72 41 9 152 108 160 157	I love the preservation of our history.
157	112 34 173 23 194 156 199 64 42 140 157	These rocks symbolize the past.
157	131 179 158 78 142 103 183 163 87 181 157	Why do restaurants have to try and incorporate emojis into their signs? There is already too much texting during meals.
157	175 21 35 47 26 62 103 67 209 17 157	What a lovely couple.
157	193 90 100 195 97 13 5 174 54 64 157	That looks like some traditional dance.
157	105 37 71 30 114 36 44 133 82 141 157	They should print more textbooks. Its the best way to teach kids.
157	151 136 173 85 106 185 131 65 14 187 157	this picture is taken too close to see what it is. take a regular picture!
157	19 185 130 153 177 98 162 58 201 18 157	I like how she is dressed modestly.
157	78 68 1 196 126 127 113 73 38 26 157	Seems like quite a civilised get-together, whatever it is.
157	156 17 148 3 178 82 69 121 5 43 157	That deer needs to be moved to the forest quickly so it is back in its normal place!
157	186 214 63 167 123 156 127 4 77 200 157	This cartoon living room is quite average.
157	170 167 99 208 92 142 194 27 201 117 157	I much prefer a typical, wooden guitar over the new plastic looking ones.
157	23 33 22 48 161 31 36 11 24 116 157	The fish, although of varying colors, are swimming in the same school.
157	90 83 9 129 144 73 91 99 172 199 157	We did not have any fancy toys like these when I was a child.  Why do children need these anyway?
157	111 135 181 154 196 11 22 176 104 61 157	I love flowers in open fields, they make me think of simple times.
157	49 23 38 77 167 200 117 185 145 75 157	One should never walk alone when going down a  dark alley.
157	22 69 123 142 213 143 23 128 199 18 157	Two responsible young people doing us proud.
157	59 163 149 178 12 119 87 103 2 7 157	Spiders are surprisingly good guardians of the home.
157	81 154 57 119 148 25 99 41 179 158 157	What a traditional structure, very impressive!
157	90 124 201 181 54 133 127 40 61 156 157	I hope this little girl is being raised carefully by her parents - so that she becomes a respectful and responsible adult.
157	214 99 116 108 68 100 122 77 152 39 157	Well hello buddy how was your day?
157	34 137 215 135 197 161 82 172 159 176 157	We need more factories in our country. This makes me miss the old days.
157	127 94 191 38 99 212 39 28 178 55 157	They need not be playing in that dirty water.
157	57 188 8 173 69 105 122 138 10 35 157	With all the video games and tablets and what, I think this sign describes most of today's generation.
157	1 177 34 212 98 146 108 189 198 24 157	I hope that player is a boy. Girls shouldn't be playing contact sports.
157	130 108 145 43 105 150 188 181 214 14 157	I like cooking with just a bit of salt and not too many condiments.
157	2 53 20 72 46 154 16 129 120 140 157	Green is the best symbol of fiscal responsibility for the future.
157	196 116 204 187 1 25 69 213 73 136 157	Nice arch ways a beautiful structer.
157	18 123 100 133 145 132 70 105 24 63 157	Those are cute polar bears very beautifully.
157	41 136 58 92 24 204 53 214 198 62 157	Love traditionals weddings!
157	35 170 191 119 159 130 193 128 25 59 157	the baby on the right looks like a real go getter
157	2 180 124 104 159 174 120 130 190 125 157	Homes are better when they are built like this.
157	67 52 87 23 102 111 166 105 159 14 157	It's nice, but the earth is not an egg.
157	184 45 132 165 170 189 148 6 106 39 157	The view is really nice, what do you think about it?
157	64 150 154 180 140 158 168 26 193 83 157	Old traditions are an important part of consevation.
157	84 195 17 79 73 166 22 89 32 108 157	The king of the jungle is a mostly docile cat.
157	130 183 53 180 203 187 5 182 209 192 157	I think these should be trimmed back a bit.
157	182 156 31 151 194 52 173 70 25 159 157	That is a good picture of a sunset.
157	195 166 102 135 66 84 75 128 64 74 157	This is a very old house.
157	191 190 211 72 205 23 209 212 36 69 157	He should save his energy.
157	45 16 91 189 176 108 57 190 168 98 157	We should do more to avoid this sort of music that only disturb our calmness of mind
157	44 170 49 160 31 176 102 48 93 141 157	I dont like those modern colors.
157	54 198 43 107 42 61 125 13 6 211 157	This meal looks small
157	115 199 125 91 102 180 159 15 75 116 157	A steady pace wins the race.
157	177 13 139 7 30 188 154 11 112 22 157	Thats a healthy environment for that blank canvases.
157	39 92 35 138 38 3 210 181 207 72 157	This art is a provocation!
157	48 23 167 140 149 137 35 60 72 151 157	The moon alway makes me think of how things used to be..
157	75 202 74 12 73 140 65 25 79 98 157	The woods have always been a big part of my family's life.
157	18 178 61 181 75 110 144 201 1 117 157	I like how he used the same frame for each of the pictures.
157	120 79 43 25 115 167 101 172 116 152 157	There shouldn't be so much glass on a traditional building like this.
157	5 121 124 1 72 79 51 113 118 88 157	Bathing suits these days are too revealing.
157	186 138 63 35 113 2 166 180 163 65 157	A wonderful traditional archway.
157	31 118 149 156 59 91 24 99 134 66 157	If I had to choose a wardrobe that would make me as normal as possible, this would be it.
157	143 121 53 29 71 181 22 101 70 138 157	Where is his shirt. It is not proper to let your chest hang out for the world to see.
157	165 120 199 124 209 109 14 159 210 90 157	No! Save the trees!
157	102 132 115 47 150 79 25 6 56 208 157	That's a little too busy for my taste.
157	68 13 56 132 35 64 153 208 4 136 157	The roofs look like traditional wave patterns.
157	88 193 55 100 170 149 36 184 105 161 157	Trees remind me of the strength of the family.
157	23 95 69 188 119 1 189 2 201 45 157	I'd prefer to stay in yay house.
157	27 45 166 35 44 42 76 96 111 191 157	Celebrations of your heritage are important to carry on the family culture.
157	18 178 83 142 100 3 2 180 185 167 157	Sporting tickets are too expensive to splurge on.
157	146 69 39 135 164 33 199 128 36 168 157	It is nice to see a picture of a church.  People don't go to them enough these days.
157	143 137 210 13 43 37 95 147 16 77 157	The old ways need to return.
157	175 71 119 40 172 88 210 197 41 176 157	What ever happened to wearing classy makeup?
157	202 52 171 51 16 26 113 180 203 49 157	He may be young, but boys his age should be wearing more masculine costumes like a police officer.
157	79 145 43 143 94 108 169 132 40 146 157	Back in my day we didn't need animated women to make us happy, we had REAL women.
157	33 147 129 35 88 210 91 205 89 143 157	back then we had the best tanks!
157	104 94 163 72 208 158 193 210 53 63 157	It is a great day to be alive in the outdoors!
157	25 119 15 124 112 205 185 125 37 22 157	Tear that sign down
157	105 163 45 144 132 208 71 85 28 69 157	This is the way we should all live.
157	159 208 121 96 139 7 79 137 203 18 157	I'm on the boat my dad bought me for my birthday today.
157	197 44 162 33 80 155 89 181 45 194 157	Need to cut that plant down some.
157	151 46 165 64 155 161 2 162 140 84 157	This color is a bit much for me. I prefer traditional white
157	196 57 79 165 116 37 117 172 119 26 157	At least there is 1, that will feed us for weeks
157	85 28 42 93 122 169 54 34 196 200 157	The French cuffs on the man's dress shirt are a sensible and safe fashion choice.
157	67 80 94 99 199 69 128 114 148 138 157	Wisdom comes those who speak less.
157	206 160 59 109 125 210 184 121 4 142 157	Art has no place on buildings.
157	63 52 214 197 39 42 208 94 199 123 157	Family comes first.
157	139 15 38 41 121 147 152 101 54 45 157	A little too exotic for my taste.
157	151 159 25 214 126 62 100 89 77 94 157	An adult should not let a child put glasses on her, the role is untraditional.
157	99 69 138 45 172 208 213 10 149 89 157	What sport is this? I'm not too caught up on female athletic teams, sorry.
157	82 138 51 202 156 188 183 184 101 52 157	Everyone wears the same shorts when playing.
157	214 200 116 124 125 98 144 82 87 146 157	It's like this everywhere

157	204 41 213 128 155 39 66 146 1 29 157	Trees with such organisms like algae should be treated or cut down in worse scenarios.
157	87 198 76 49 210 201 46 67 94 126 157	It is nice to see women covering up these days.

157	55 9 161 116 140 192 29 30 50 199 157	I wish this road was flat and straight, this is too different.
157	108 103 135 158 179 54 212 197 185 19 157	An ad on a sign.
157	199 27 45 192 51 141 173 104 132 140 157	In my day music was created on instruments, not on machines to crowds full of Molly.
157	70 107 137 143 169 34 5 120 48 160 157	Now this is a REAL gentleman's sport, stately and dignified.
157	36 96 21 144 14 176 87 150 25 174 157	its nice to see real music still has a place.
157	176 112 214 141 12 152 160 107 126 181 157	This is such a nostalgic picture, reminds me of my youth walking in the snow.

157	117 52 131 115 163 119 161 95 13 29 157	He should take his time.
157	177 81 64 38 95 92 26 137 77 190 157	This is a business meeting.
157	91 194 101 42 186 207 152 187 59 22 157	The us of a helmet by experts is a good trend.
157	129 137 97 211 156 28 29 100 134 193 157	this is nice
157	36 202 207 83 133 82 61 104 124 203 157	Try to make this out of clay.
157	119 93 152 202 173 26 122 14 143 181 157	Perfectly cute skirt for a school uniform.

157	122 128 116 177 165 66 26 29 6 64 157	That hat has no place in this society
157	159 60 36 45 49 101 71 46 73 70 157	Why do you need a pool next to the ocean?
157	99 192 26 154 97 162 127 178 105 21 157	Skiing should be on real snow only.
157	115 13 142 211 191 33 180 196 60 181 157	Learn our culture with this lecture
157	46 102 207 214 36 150 198 159 174 75 157	the house is very open and clean looking i think its very chic
157	207 84 107 153 144 122 164 61 36 162 157	Scenes like this remind me of growing up in the quiet, conservative South
157	93 96 193 144 203 20 139 142 16 174 157	they're trying to dress appropriately for the event
157	45 12 126 113 90 132 206 97 144 69 157	this is a ancient chinese buildng
157	64 204 209 135 93 60 210 137 37 12 157	No need to waste time clearing the snow.
157	185 130 19 87 202 90 122 128 42 192 157	Looks like a secret, hidden carnival.
157	37 120 52 93 186 114 206 103 5 86 157	This red is a joyful color.
157	131 206 179 193 181 6 44 170 66 87 157	I wish he would wear a shirt as there are children around.
157	43 10 167 23 91 121 77 112 78 162 157	This piece is too weird.
157	4 127 6 89 76 66 56 205 92 214 157	Learning technical thing like this is a noble trade and necessary for our economy.
157	42 103 23 26 215 212 11 143 22 135 157	This poor child looks scared.  I wish I could see the photo better to see if a parent is nearby in the background.
157	169 167 158 145 113 187 23 204 176 32 157	The color combinations are not correct on this rug it is a knock off.
157	21 99 96 7 49 97 8 59 214 179 157	Animals like this have no place in zoos
157	2 52 136 55 171 132 125 22 163 177 157	They shouldn't be doing this in public
157	57 76 72 190 123 169 135 55 207 177 157	You gotta make hay while the sun shines. Hard work is the making of a man.
157	36 133 215 44 155 53 66 24 190 12 157	The water looks quite dirty, from this perspective, maybe we should band together as a community and clean it up.  My church group could help!
157	188 133 85 55 165 10 20 17 32 178 157	the soccer player looks determined to hit the ball. I want him on my soccer team!
157	102 194 72 199 115 127 149 206 57 85 157	It is important to have at least a modicum of reservation such as this man.
157	37 126 174 73 69 84 131 107 205 10 157	The weather seems to be holding up for this outdoor wedding...
157	27 116 75 21 151 205 195 163 28 108 157	its not human traditional
157	41 130 31 56 75 104 67 52 176 101 157	He have traditional look
157	46 21 105 163 128 115 74 214 85 63 157	Where are these children's parents?
157	37 192 124 181 5 39 137 195 87 189 157	A market in time that has seen so much of history.
157	134 209 103 57 193 116 147 21 208 167 157	Modern architecture is stupid. Buildings are supposed to get the job done and that is it.
157	112 111 118 160 209 196 135 81 35 13 157	What a strange piece of art
157	110 87 56 83 164 29 63 103 179 181 157	This window is very pretty.
157	95 22 169 129 87 155 132 180 139 108 157	Here we are in the spot where everyone takes a picture of God's wonderment.
157	202 100 64 161 170 203 73 115 197 93 157	a little too frilly
157	101 44 170 164 116 198 124 86 202 213 157	The culture here must be preserved, its traditions are important.
158	61 176 174 87 135 115 47 74 138 155 158	Cool beach pic.
158	77 100 112 189 146 41 172 78 29 38 158	Nice scenery pic.
158	162 39 147 81 167 213 24 80 86 6 158	That thing looks heavy.
158	25 10 108 159 195 171 101 174 114 59 158	Guitar playing? Sounds like work.
158	173 150 44 17 125 67 215 210 20 176 158	I could never do this
158	28 126 178 150 87 157 180 201 203 13 158	Man, I'd go hang out in this park with these guys, but walking those two blocks is just...yeah, no.
158	128 44 23 129 205 96 39 24 12 138 158	This probably took way too long to paint.
158	63 109 30 133 72 44 195 210 58 107 158	Wonder how many houses are in that picture. Not gonna take the time to count.
158	159 208 61 139 108 133 97 195 172 51 158	Wonder how deep that water is. I don't really care that much though
158	91 59 172 126 5 140 83 72 50 102 158	That looks like a lot of work. Why don't they have chairs?
158	80 170 193 45 63 130 132 95 32 129 158	I'm not even going to try to fix my car. I'm just going to call AARP and have them take care of it.
158	140 188 148 152 36 128 183 8 72 74 158	did they have a uniform?
158	200 149 46 205 94 88 32 135 25 9 158	These men look like they work hard, not like me.
158	98 54 161 82 133 184 34 212 182 207 158	The moon reminds me it's time for bed.
158	165 138 210 71 74 94 34 92 8 43 158	I could lay on a boat all day.
158	190 87 129 113 39 4 121 91 21 173 158	Ugh, this map is so un-colorful. I would rather use my phone to search for a place.
158	141 31 199 130 20 81 196 202 121 78 158	This is a day I would sleep in.
158	142 197 120 22 97 179 48 108 213 37 158	The stream is sluggish
158	105 50 146 155 167 195 79 86 134 194 158	The city has dull people
158	170 71 174 145 143 1 75 88 199 117 158	I haven't gotten up to throw this away yet
158	137 68 175 148 163 172 144 112 131 53 158	Idlesse, Inaction, careless, lentitude, tired
158	145 209 86 201 211 174 134 73 8 31 158	Comic con is cool, but I'd rather look at updates about it on my phone than actually attend the event.
158	164 204 10 170 30 66 62 184 138 106 158	Navigating through a city often feels like a chore.
158	92 132 9 4 19 32 164 52 85 106 158	I tried to shop at this store, but they would't find all my items for me, how bizarre is that?
158	144 118 45 99 9 82 21 211 124 89 158	A road to take a slow stroll down
158	140 126 33 53 94 201 40 18 44 143 158	They should be working.
158	18 119 193 187 204 107 77 123 208 29 158	What is really going on here?
158	142 102 66 173 60 33 74 56 135 90 158	vey cute horse.
158	66 188 11 18 36 3 123 41 27 92 158	Outside in the snow? Have fun, buddy, I'll be in here sipping my coffee.
158	44 166 28 133 181 33 197 147 124 25 158	Cute little pig.
158	126 204 89 152 138 116 93 7 102 106 158	I wouldn't even bother moving all day if I had this view.
158	151 191 15 111 75 71 49 203 10 165 158	The water looks sluggish
158	140 90 69 11 20 162 209 121 176 38 158	I find the bike in active today
158	113 84 85 214 15 86 21 19 131 4 158	Cut your hair, boy.
158	16 101 66 79 78 175 64 50 163 128 158	These would be best dried and preserved.
158	113 26 118 128 193 14 28 76 38 20 158	Oh what a nice spot to relax.
158	192 88 182 13 155 176 166 135 16 131 158	This color makes me want to sleep.
158	88 24 53 128 47 173 126 62 68 210 158	What a nice concert.
158	38 174 161 192 9 63 148 171 108 6 158	I never get to take pictures like this because I never go outside.,
158	94 211 213 105 123 152 111 2 52 125 158	What an interesting reunion picture.
158	144 205 162 175 16 8 140 85 198 39 158	Oh what a strange car.
158	179 193 97 7 203 130 58 204 112 119 158	Those are people
158	89 101 48 59 20 131 155 47 98 181 158	basketball, sports, hoops
158	152 20 204 149 5 164 187 6 77 92 158	is there any food in there
158	192 186 213 79 122 170 132 14 84 200 158	I hate going outside into the city.
158	194 154 168 179 166 82 129 97 114 152 158	this is boring.
158	75 13 2 210 15 133 10 74 72 17 158	I'll just wave hello to every one from here.
158	123 95 152 6 2 199 143 125 169 127 158	Well this is a heap of metal. Why would anyone waste their time fixing this?
158	140 165 61 138 191 152 170 68 92 67 158	yup two guys hanging out.
158	134 172 111 43 25 133 157 32 149 76 158	I would not be out riding like this when I could be in bed.
158	166 15 1 70 191 63 156 90 126 169 158	I'm not going to take the time to read that article.
158	119 163 188 192 132 19 12 182 146 180 158	Ever heard about snail's pace? Yes, the train seem to ride at just that.
158	83 94 204 29 202 169 179 181 14 189 158	My vision is so blurry but I can't be bothered to find my glasses.
158	152 106 127 105 41 89 54 52 210 44 158	Just couldn't go get it yourself.
158	41 91 76 80 136 13 120 201 212 47 158	She didn't even try.
158	57 12 73 179 173 124 29 139 63 26 158	what an interesting moment
158	104 107 18 182 172 4 60 160 44 124 158	Sitting and watching tv all day every day.
158	99 124 25 80 119 180 214 205 49 104 158	Wish I had the energy to go to the concert.
158	156 46 23 22 201 21 29 157 105 95 158	I think the kid wants to be carried
158	152 33 141 46 27 108 81 16 150 64 158	They don't look like the most comfortable rocks, but I could probably get a nap out of it.
158	39 136 3 6 120 101 85 73 82 68 158	I'm too lazy to walk the rest of the way.
158	77 75 69 50 47 79 43 15 91 187 158	i couldn't get off the couch for this show
158	71 185 27 129 135 200 205 214 22 153 158	i saw a bird too but i didn't feel like taking a picture.
158	84 106 212 18 176 213 76 17 89 181 158	Lets move the ladders tomorrow instead
158	118 175 131 214 40 94 169 89 20 123 158	I would soak myself in the bathtub  and lay there while i sip my wine
158	1 41 184 38 86 22 196 138 157 160 158	Is that like a car or something?
158	211 21 149 104 122 78 64 169 137 5 158	It's a shirt
158	45 16 122 204 84 182 24 118 181 103 158	Girl holding balloons
158	61 33 199 129 173 207 131 149 109 8 158	Is that like the sun or the moon?
158	142 207 191 146 145 99 48 93 200 31 158	She looks bored.
158	35 186 60 90 119 155 31 100 59 206 158	I really wish uber could somehow airlift me to were I am trying to walk.
158	186 27 194 106 196 112 150 120 175 184 158	This looks like rocks.
158	8 204 7 126 139 69 197 47 68 116 158	I wish I could take a nap on these chairs.
158	161 62 8 166 148 211 57 106 51 5 158	I will leave this mess for the next shift.
158	43 65 179 123 51 150 112 152 173 120 158	There is no way I would hike up that mountain.
158	91 162 204 205 167 143 68 155 61 73 158	hey now. i am typing this comment from the floor. #relatable
158	96 116 117 24 167 56 138 210 191 53 158	great vacation pic, but how long did you spend adding that filter?
158	183 74 198 129 215 103 200 113 110 55 158	I'd pick this flower, but I dont feel like it.
158	65 189 63 197 185 156 167 133 81 159 158	This is me every weekend.
158	172 136 152 11 188 53 65 58 166 87 158	The office needs a couch instead of uncomfy chairs.
158	104 25 163 191 156 19 171 151 117 170 158	I would never in a million years do this.
158	70 19 204 54 200 135 79 21 95 96 158	I wouldnt be able to walk more than an inch in the desert
158	28 185 144 17 53 89 173 3 123 109 158	I wouldn't wanna even bother these people.
158	40 169 154 120 159 173 51 208 197 41 158	Can you count how many people are in the picture, im tired
158	51 58 210 111 154 199 3 127 83 173 158	I would rather take a car than walk across this bridge.
158	78 36 45 82 69 166 115 189 81 102 158	Goodness, it took so long to walk up here. Wasn't even worth it.
158	82 71 29 5 31 61 28 109 115 103 158	Jeez, I would've hated putting that up.
158	189 91 45 137 88 200 3 101 212 176 158	That's too heavy to deal with.
158	170 156 39 126 67 141 144 4 167 1 158	I wish I could go to sleep on that couch.
158	27 90 148 17 57 127 193 103 169 43 158	I would never want to climb that high.
158	157 30 96 145 102 177 150 123 68 62 158	I am going to climb into the boat, push off shore, and sleep the day away.
158	54 157 210 58 153 137 185 25 49 91 158	I could sit and stare at flowers all day.\
158	59 101 140 29 181 64 91 128 169 19 158	I am too tired to clip this hair.
158	16 67 207 89 96 54 154 178 172 165 158	Too tired to put in the effort of being a ballerina.
158	180 168 208 104 51 39 107 211 11 199 158	Kid pretending to be Indiana Jones
158	139 55 108 214 61 115 7 114 47 2 158	I would rather watch tv
158	39 86 28 35 68 85 214 164 125 57 158	I wish i could have this car, but it is too much to clean and take good care of it all the time
158	151 37 148 129 89 30 138 128 99 24 158	This color makes me want to nap.
158	16 37 5 81 176 51 194 108 127 65 158	Ugh, can you change the baby's diaper? I cannot change anymore!
158	166 102 73 119 75 37 105 144 189 198 158	What a nice place to sit.
158	17 31 54 149 194 165 5 168 12 25 158	This shade of blue makes me want to go to sleep.
158	213 34 191 134 186 68 170 92 128 178 158	That looks like water.
158	130 71 181 114 28 11 100 29 136 57 158	Ugh, I don't want to shovel the snow
158	176 123 173 77 133 52 83 76 180 101 158	What I would do to have a life like his! Just floating around on sea currents all day... How dreamy...
158	8 22 48 164 70 100 127 29 201 132 158	Laying on the couch with a dog. Living my dream life.
158	211 23 181 122 127 7 104 102 50 175 158	I never sing or talk to anyone like these people, it's too much work.
158	5 21 178 197 131 76 82 141 166 109 158	I'd rather be at home
158	167 85 4 190 96 183 131 192 206 186 158	These are tiles.
158	184 141 42 69 148 112 3 99 153 129 158	I'm feel so tired this days.
158	169 160 140 104 181 25 198 154 115 71 158	I'd like to take a nap on that boat.
158	206 92 22 100 58 96 202 169 161 66 158	The kids in this class look like they don't even want to be there haha.
158	65 86 46 40 111 193 18 181 151 96 158	I'd stay sitting-- standing is too much effort.
158	80 36 191 154 38 43 108 168 145 129 158	The words on the pictures are too small to read.
158	56 98 84 52 142 22 192 176 103 110 158	She is somewhat dancing.
158	164 103 96 99 189 18 74 155 19 27 158	I'll call an Uber before I drive myself.
158	125 19 61 86 51 25 161 111 167 156 158	This color makes me sleepy.
158	55 15 69 143 40 180 38 4 173 163 158	Can you move my hands for me, I have no energy left.
158	110 203 145 162 194 212 32 201 14 93 158	I could just curl up in one of those cubbies and fall fast asleep!
158	48 31 202 84 200 213 75 174 67 162 158	The restaurant is far
158	167 48 114 121 83 22 124 70 14 35 158	Someone should probaby clean that up.
158	24 100 86 187 80 113 22 149 32 138 158	In my perfect world, I would be fed by somebody else without having to get up.
158	132 92 104 98 9 17 179 186 187 205 158	I guess I might think about going to this.
158	102 1 193 144 74 191 213 101 16 200 158	Needs to dress a little better.
158	38 74 211 46 45 10 113 178 17 101 158	Wish she'd come over here
158	148 137 72 183 46 15 193 101 77 29 158	I want to go to church sometimes, but it is too far away.
158	42 152 182 50 193 67 121 203 164 32 158	I'm not climbing that.
158	5 138 77 60 169 136 47 7 85 38 158	thats really cool
158	10 83 203 134 191 60 129 175 5 100 158	This truck will need to sit here for years.
158	57 166 59 4 165 78 77 97 208 5 158	I wouldn't even bother.
158	114 95 117 22 162 92 104 204 101 113 158	Looks like a nice place for a walk, if I liked walking
158	50 144 125 114 212 131 215 167 120 135 158	I hope it rains often there because I'm too lazy to go out and water
158	130 43 62 117 77 56 46 37 166 44 158	So we have to go all the way around? No thanks.
158	82 117 21 128 127 174 148 112 52 19 158	I would get tired just standing up there.
158	163 166 104 66 32 65 84 47 1 53 158	Too many walks to have a dog
158	4 10 186 171 200 193 63 161 26 32 158	Ugh.  Walking around. Looks hard.
158	192 123 211 100 117 87 135 98 104 171 158	man that place is across the street, not going there
158	15 51 89 58 190 112 45 132 62 81 158	I was supposed to pain the bricks last week, but nah.
158	121 30 183 171 194 116 5 46 212 179 158	I would hate to navigate through this city every day.
158	154 108 13 59 97 1 46 199 129 105 158	I wouldnt want to do what he has to at that party.
158	74 176 155 180 196 125 68 165 140 159 158	Music concert at the meeting
158	40 200 15 213 110 23 199 10 131 17 158	No way I'm going there, I just want to sit at home all day.
158	198 181 91 61 161 127 122 197 79 116 158	Looks like some land.
158	59 56 61 155 25 67 34 26 3 27 158	That is just want I want to do...take a nap.
158	200 175 57 190 146 89 78 160 162 170 158	Beautiful dogs playing
158	54 55 59 79 89 145 181 208 124 71 158	As cool as it would be to go see this, no way I'm leaving my house for that.
158	134 56 137 207 59 117 48 69 114 60 158	I am not cleaning up after these kids. I never do.
158	32 30 115 12 8 120 163 74 181 202 158	These ducks make me want to swim less
158	26 105 148 38 72 9 1 74 39 202 158	A tree and a forest.
158	183 64 146 100 25 26 178 164 122 54 158	I mean it's alright isn't it? But it's not quite the city, can you imagine having to walk around all those fields, you can't even jump on a bus!
158	209 157 167 153 144 86 26 147 107 81 158	i wouldn't be bothered by getting the ball either
158	142 12 195 86 11 85 206 144 75 7 158	i'll work on it tomorrow.
158	81 183 105 62 122 140 163 94 186 133 158	I could never have muscles like that. I don't have the time to work out
158	65 187 196 146 74 197 190 75 123 69 158	That picnic looks like too much work.
158	27 160 63 4 120 208 166 80 76 121 158	Is this like a pie or something?
158	60 196 24 164 143 184 116 146 206 108 158	That roof looks like a bit of a pain to put on. Just stick a flat roof on!
158	166 26 71 175 12 207 25 74 116 18 158	I would go for a walk, but I can't be bothered.
158	43 9 134 167 189 151 112 8 62 36 158	Only one firework for 4th of July, but hey it'll work.
158	117 183 16 188 13 23 124 34 164 169 158	No meaning sculpture
158	214 192 204 33 68 200 45 88 66 62 158	She has carrots.
158	208 179 187 183 80 146 42 83 197 144 158	Kind of neat.
158	75 41 186 130 55 155 51 120 154 213 158	Yeah! Lets sit all day and do nothing!
158	123 78 173 84 189 155 88 16 112 7 158	Ideal morning would be to eat about five of these and then have a nap.
158	124 129 83 110 141 47 42 208 117 212 158	I could never climb to a view like that, trust.
158	80 189 160 111 72 167 187 38 123 46 158	I don't usually feel getting up to open my door when someone knocks.
158	152 163 126 67 38 27 168 176 157 29 158	I didn't feel like putting her hat on
158	182 112 13 114 33 65 83 67 43 37 158	Well down time is necessary too.
158	140 174 111 214 114 154 161 49 110 73 158	Green like grass
158	196 83 207 82 44 162 123 26 174 214 158	Ok private tom, can you pick my gun for me? thank you.
158	190 62 132 194 215 113 92 70 214 96 158	Driving a boat. Thats an easy job.
158	58 19 51 10 12 87 198 118 42 150 158	Why can't you just take a battery lamp?
158	47 150 46 68 176 35 161 86 156 136 158	nice drawing of a pepper.
158	168 112 14 120 161 12 103 137 169 2 158	No idea what it is or what it means.
158	87 96 100 16 179 72 116 64 215 84 158	That guy definitely has the best parking spot.
158	52 189 141 146 17 4 7 181 204 89 158	I'm too tired to untie him. Maybe tomorrow.
158	94 89 102 86 144 13 130 48 215 170 158	Looks like too much work to ride
158	165 146 138 167 3 196 90 87 111 60 158	Get me a beer and a couch and im set
158	140 137 104 106 43 133 55 71 88 147 158	I was thinking about getting up and going to the store, but...Nah.
158	49 4 129 120 130 66 76 139 106 27 158	Too much work to get a personal plate
158	123 128 153 92 95 185 133 7 71 163 158	The ceiling is way to high.  I would never clean it.
158	208 182 68 215 97 202 32 51 70 171 158	GOD! Why the heck would I ever even go to this store it's so HARD and you know talking to these people would take so much WORK.
158	9 32 210 86 79 45 62 73 2 107 158	Ok, someone else get up and give my part.
158	182 214 37 155 18 102 52 197 132 107 158	Too much decorating, too much worj
158	14 59 10 167 53 20 183 96 145 101 158	you can never win if you never fini...
158	118 74 172 135 165 6 78 181 94 113 158	I really do not want to have to wash this cup and saucer, I want to relax.
158	154 129 99 189 188 108 56 212 91 4 158	I wish I had my own personal limo so I'd never have to drive.
158	61 186 108 184 65 176 75 153 131 110 158	I just feel like sitting in that shade
158	113 109 150 148 149 59 136 7 36 47 158	If I knew what these meant I wouldn't even bother to work it out.
159	30 134 107 122 148 91 50 115 35 192 159	What is this structure? It's very boring.
159	24 113 121 197 180 12 94 40 67 28 159	Trees, sky behind it. Could be a bird I think
159	149 118 115 176 56 41 156 6 1 55 159	Nice bear statues
159	88 108 102 153 49 84 124 166 57 77 159	He must be getting a reward..?
159	79 25 74 15 50 181 155 95 215 49 159	This color is nice.
159	154 140 118 212 188 86 148 24 133 139 159	The rocks are cool. Water is alright too I guess
159	102 90 189 130 212 157 188 197 198 63 159	This is a lighter
159	212 151 173 131 183 41 46 114 189 153 159	The girl was lacking original though
159	2 110 95 87 214 202 81 204 215 200 159	I don't know what they would build there.
159	138 30 107 137 103 166 111 184 48 172 159	What's that shape in the grass suppose to be?
159	191 59 92 89 3 8 126 41 95 53 159	I like your logs.
159	29 149 117 176 18 40 45 32 146 3 159	The house looks sufficient.
159	200 45 44 142 78 186 106 127 62 114 159	He will jump high, I bet.
159	84 35 77 61 103 10 193 66 110 112 159	I think the house is good as is.
159	91 49 186 21 86 42 19 47 125 65 159	That's a boring looking moth.
159	209 142 149 94 8 176 128 2 75 110 159	Yes, yellow truck, i see it.
159	203 86 51 4 157 173 205 16 101 155 159	This guitar player might have stubbed his toe.
159	215 198 90 70 26 84 197 52 94 119 159	Some brown boats.
159	26 172 81 188 10 27 8 67 70 101 159	just a thunder
159	185 208 145 112 2 63 44 115 207 40 159	gaunt, impotent, flimsy
159	129 104 30 12 77 49 200 9 19 78 159	I don't think there is any other way this could have been designed.
159	6 127 50 152 197 66 2 175 125 137 159	I see a cat.
159	73 47 16 108 103 197 208 39 44 174 159	This is the Eiffel Tower located in Paris, France
159	1 6 130 15 163 40 207 76 133 213 159	Two penguins are standing on a rock.
159	24 140 169 60 98 69 70 167 12 100 159	I like her hat.
159	123 48 66 199 197 142 35 206 38 207 159	I don't know how many of these pictures I have seen now.
159	173 62 38 194 128 19 149 9 203 200 159	This is the average way to take a photo, eh.
159	42 194 205 177 176 199 33 137 134 49 159	This little guy is getting old.
159	141 181 156 55 135 134 177 32 41 49 159	This must be tropical.
159	158 177 69 200 213 147 96 46 169 99 159	Looks like sand and brick are plentiful here.
159	88 95 147 135 2 28 198 180 98 120 159	Looks like they might be demonstrating.
159	109 87 5 39 143 7 119 215 183 22 159	She must like to read.
159	97 13 11 136 156 25 162 202 167 76 159	The picture is copper
159	96 125 136 208 155 179 165 32 40 69 159	A light is just a light.
159	185 138 21 43 27 175 174 142 170 44 159	I would have just worn jeans and a t-shirt for this photo.
159	34 167 143 36 193 78 106 77 197 2 159	Those are pretty earrings.
159	110 12 203 72 199 47 183 178 100 121 159	I love the dirt lawn.
159	70 12 22 213 135 182 209 40 109 14 159	Here is a bunch of naked statues.
159	85 170 78 43 153 2 37 105 178 123 159	This looks like fireworks.
159	63 56 89 191 209 69 201 161 149 26 159	He is training to box
159	102 195 8 170 17 160 70 2 55 44 159	I don't know what a plain purple square can mean...
159	62 30 161 156 94 144 131 16 146 213 159	simple pose for the simple man
159	104 83 49 79 15 73 138 77 129 64 159	The water is pretty.
159	3 205 11 8 119 53 174 74 204 115 159	Lots of piles of dirt
159	108 67 124 153 186 103 210 53 112 157 159	Why wouldn't you just buy the toys instead of having to build them?
159	167 10 55 68 146 48 34 166 90 201 159	This car is too extravagant. My race care would be solid black.
159	71 185 178 110 7 17 209 214 145 69 159	Huh. Pork on a rack. Nice.

159	67 191 10 132 78 23 49 121 180 158 159	This map could tell you what you wanted to know about an area.
159	164 115 156 101 10 66 60 25 30 24 159	A funniest picture
159	143 34 120 56 139 13 123 16 88 25 159	They are eating food.
159	191 137 125 150 204 13 207 48 161 47 159	Just a typical night
159	107 128 65 190 91 55 136 134 135 144 159	The baby looks bored.
159	30 193 154 124 67 27 142 6 61 182 159	tunnels are generally useless as it reuires a lot of maintainance
159	61 90 204 139 42 15 195 75 34 20 159	That drink is orange.
159	11 103 72 91 74 158 168 54 80 90 159	This appears to be a basement in some type of building.
159	14 178 145 95 150 163 152 120 127 161 159	her mustache is probably fake
159	53 166 58 129 49 198 25 42 148 116 159	That building is tall.
159	171 11 122 156 93 179 183 157 1 155 159	This is a parking lot.
159	42 116 13 108 193 197 101 83 40 174 159	It is a baby
159	189 35 70 8 51 49 7 3 110 142 159	It's a bus
159	188 213 136 30 81 169 191 89 47 156 159	Another boring rock and sky picture.
159	55 178 191 184 41 71 200 164 181 94 159	This feels so bland to me.
159	207 70 189 135 210 125 75 96 85 162 159	i like flowers
159	66 205 70 81 167 183 176 71 54 179 159	gray and some colors

159	205 185 116 45 33 4 72 69 141 127 159	Why is there a hand in this photo? Do not get it.
159	161 121 9 160 118 80 18 28 152 170 159	It all looks like a giant waste of time with the dancing.

159	206 102 74 187 15 89 78 149 105 90 159	This photo is so boring. It's out of focus, I can't see anyone's face. What's the point
159	80 131 85 187 22 126 171 117 135 160 159	Hanging out with these kids would be boring and uneventful
159	82 178 195 176 85 144 182 62 214 209 159	The green light ruins this image.
159	64 81 166 116 145 119 40 120 189 106 159	I am very appealed to these sort of archaic fashion designs
159	143 29 105 172 163 79 153 149 176 208 159	This is kind of boring. What kind of picture is this. Someone spilled coffee on the wall thats all.
159	127 115 19 96 200 153 193 47 7 177 159	Their faces shows they are bored up and dull.
159	146 10 60 194 125 201 115 95 137 84 159	Wow an image of the Eiffel tower
159	105 39 194 89 209 11 43 74 66 9 159	Feathers are so last season.

159	45 18 68 189 177 26 58 160 120 200 159	A purple box. Wow.
159	33 190 1 134 74 155 54 95 94 166 159	The haircut should be left as is.
159	83 80 5 119 133 200 153 127 24 56 159	Brown and red brick roof on a beige house.
159	56 200 142 187 171 137 47 34 126 107 159	I think he is a lawyer.
159	119 38 105 174 177 198 150 101 168 182 159	someone printed and framed clipart
159	167 99 30 20 34 78 1 175 116 207 159	This is a gate.
159	133 153 208 177 85 38 139 188 114 210 159	nice green shirts
159	151 22 160 15 92 101 170 122 116 94 159	why add anything to it
159	22 49 155 115 27 117 206 89 186 150 159	the picture is old and unpleasing
159	38 154 32 51 165 191 213 88 91 182 159	yuck... ! how ugly.. can any one get rid off this one
159	44 153 72 176 124 140 190 33 185 59 159	This guy is doing a sad job trying to sing.
159	115 198 100 125 192 46 130 183 31 63 159	What are they going to do with this then?
159	33 78 18 105 25 160 106 24 20 6 159	They are talking.
159	28 145 160 49 36 209 162 150 69 3 159	looks like a switch ?
159	60 20 128 124 135 78 112 50 132 163 159	Soccer is such a fun sport. So many rules to make sure everyone plays correctly.
159	111 182 60 89 143 132 120 185 66 124 159	This is a color.
159	140 43 153 50 151 84 207 3 78 194 159	I don't see the essence of this aged structure.
159	25 70 151 130 62 141 145 109 204 171 159	Just tear it all down and build a parking lot, I guess.
159	58 198 144 148 176 59 162 61 209 147 159	Someone should tell them they're going to get hurt playing in the dark.
159	44 193 206 161 195 127 60 79 76 28 159	The bikes have crashed.
159	39 32 73 144 141 206 119 162 137 153 159	Guy is doing nothing.
159	88 55 102 46 188 33 99 118 139 122 159	This race car is so cool. What would it look like it it was blue? I can't really imagine that.
159	21 126 1 186 6 208 63 105 104 17 159	This is a city.
159	150 127 96 137 121 23 186 12 136 72 159	that's a nice image
159	83 112 71 161 9 121 145 141 4 185 159	What are they doing? I don't get it. Is she walking it?
159	77 197 56 106 152 129 126 151 29 89 159	Way too cluttered to do anything.
159	1 49 198 167 39 113 157 7 62 161 159	Those kids are playing.
159	59 35 160 60 209 131 104 150 41 33 159	Just some reflections.
159	66 170 171 110 112 197 91 42 124 184 159	Just a boring desert.
159	164 213 105 14 169 69 95 84 112 23 159	This is a building.
159	188 83 179 29 101 167 116 12 90 166 159	This is baseball.
159	65 124 25 168 127 109 62 42 106 151 159	i see two signs in the window
159	204 155 49 116 2 117 215 18 104 55 159	He is playing a trumpet with a stuffed parrot
159	151 166 47 29 68 60 55 205 215 155 159	The beaches waters are as blue as ever.
159	101 123 2 151 61 73 14 204 59 26 159	Should find the shortest route possible through this city without regard for the sights to see.
159	113 199 124 117 42 85 39 55 141 63 159	Wow how green!
159	19 15 29 96 95 143 56 87 134 103 159	Uniformed patterns always look best.
159	130 89 110 52 19 31 80 117 9 44 159	The Eiffel Tower is a place I might like to visit.
159	107 37 16 105 91 146 205 80 12 163 159	I love this, grey is my favorite color.
159	196 188 73 48 206 140 63 93 17 189 159	those people look drunk
159	205 212 157 106 155 191 41 5 86 1 159	nice trees and calm water
159	213 63 92 176 72 14 140 132 117 18 159	The girl is smiling on a porch.
159	165 32 76 22 145 212 166 6 81 125 159	His hair needs a cut but I can't think of a better style.
159	83 99 210 185 173 5 194 154 134 47 159	A guy with weird colored hair.
159	185 214 172 187 184 57 138 158 60 206 159	A male in front of a sign.
159	186 23 141 182 145 111 13 156 180 60 159	With those lights in the background this was obviously during Christmas time.
159	110 94 131 17 68 121 163 109 205 74 159	They should drink more water and maybe they would not be so hot.
159	25 208 1 64 107 82 212 168 187 42 159	This t shirt is orange in color.
159	59 22 52 181 161 141 121 133 24 215 159	Why are those people standing in line?
159	55 33 1 175 13 197 38 136 195 191 159	This is about as good as wine can be.
159	15 132 39 166 89 84 116 63 209 104 159	Wow this photo is pretty.
159	165 192 78 16 130 12 100 10 25 55 159	A winter exhibition
159	62 208 49 87 28 71 152 58 54 18 159	That is a protruding surface on that building.
159	156 162 119 90 200 21 139 177 32 199 159	This is nice
159	27 143 128 71 191 188 138 141 55 51 159	Is that just 3 people standing in front of a clay roofed building? Looks pretty boring to me.
159	29 161 57 134 129 59 130 22 37 138 159	This is true art, putting some words on a board.
159	147 115 113 11 149 120 213 55 102 111 159	People standing in a crowd of others.
159	74 201 60 68 198 144 140 175 213 82 159	Two people eating a bunch of food.
159	119 43 145 60 92 195 179 152 136 75 159	It's a boat and it's definitely going... dunno, somewhere.
159	46 72 83 114 172 199 110 98 71 207 159	what an ordinary looking game
159	167 129 24 132 193 156 185 11 122 183 159	dull looking image
159	116 174 86 123 111 59 215 186 144 31 159	She's probably just got coffee in that cup.
159	205 119 184 117 31 63 97 196 75 142 159	He is a musician.
159	102 71 176 42 145 142 30 192 12 49 159	That is a baby.
159	205 52 25 188 7 57 143 210 92 3 159	who would enjoy this? I think it looks weird.
159	22 72 197 43 110 17 199 200 168 194 159	golf is a thing people do, not a fan though
159	108 169 190 181 43 90 175 36 3 79 159	What's all the colors for?
159	183 190 107 54 72 161 143 210 163 25 159	The design looks bad
159	146 118 160 91 214 6 142 75 4 15 159	It's a yellow boat I think.
159	127 102 99 128 147 78 145 208 37 85 159	Is this a bus?
159	130 88 59 175 48 156 29 20 169 152 159	This looks like a yoga class.
159	165 213 190 54 55 140 26 105 186 188 159	Maybe next time take a picture of something more interesting
159	120 2 119 20 25 17 211 206 21 115 159	Wow, a DJ and a guy drinking water...original.
159	207 149 103 147 118 98 80 57 185 116 159	After a while, the bottle wax seals all look the same.
159	56 98 29 37 51 85 131 73 66 147 159	Baby in a pea green bag...really...you couldn't find something cuter?
159	38 140 48 185 193 65 173 109 105 24 159	This is not Chicago
159	137 80 197 72 34 115 165 149 88 107 159	This is a picture.
159	187 68 67 22 103 75 43 164 116 165 159	That is a group of children playing.
159	90 150 211 168 113 93 115 40 7 128 159	The table looks fine just put some folding chairs down.
159	214 72 182 49 149 28 160 4 192 87 159	This photo is okay. I have no suggestions.
159	204 33 94 141 19 185 36 76 49 214 159	This is the color of power.
159	107 150 178 114 6 101 204 72 209 62 159	They flock together like birds of a feather.
159	41 36 191 103 92 128 215 13 122 94 159	That hate is not great on him.
159	102 162 61 45 142 168 138 208 104 85 159	Does this building have to be made out of stone?
159	90 140 52 170 165 17 99 106 30 168 159	Wow! Look at the snow!
159	21 107 71 133 46 186 146 105 23 89 159	That child needs a tissue.
159	137 127 36 2 153 189 139 104 123 65 159	I could never collage photos.
159	38 111 134 109 172 184 3 41 182 44 159	The cat looks like it would bite.
159	78 15 172 215 148 31 84 128 115 71 159	They did not get everyone into view for this picture.
159	17 145 23 10 215 123 127 209 91 42 159	such a pretty dress
159	85 52 54 181 15 150 210 190 25 193 159	There sure are many people standing around that car with a sign on it.
159	72 210 101 38 122 27 147 97 193 58 159	green nothing but green
159	199 211 164 33 36 146 2 113 7 174 159	Just looking at that makes me yawn.
159	135 209 36 51 86 56 152 54 172 114 159	It's a dandelion. They say they make you wet the bed.
159	179 161 48 76 135 26 170 1 47 64 159	I wouldn't even begin to know how to make a corset like that. I would probably just copy what she's wearing exactly.
159	124 215 201 155 65 115 71 162 186 31 159	A sportsmanlike game of football between two teams.
159	99 154 17 73 21 127 76 113 87 49 159	What a nice waterfall.
159	64 121 30 194 8 151 202 204 122 193 159	I only wear white clothes, because it's easy
160	23 112 14 91 208 156 2 44 99 181 160	A gathering of the cowboy witches. All the elements are represented here, Earth, Wind, Fire and Water. Are we ready to begin with our meditation?

160	158 7 108 206 191 179 170 95 116 202 160	The trees and leaves fall and grow in the fall.
160	108 118 173 113 188 176 151 14 39 178 160	This food must have came from narnia.

160	157 124 75 76 138 176 149 201 154 10 160	This path probably leads to another world given the coloring of the stones.
160	198 196 43 138 58 11 95 168 104 36 160	Now what are poppies used for again?
160	39 202 105 193 205 84 214 60 16 26 160	If this deer head could talk..
160	94 153 163 113 33 185 57 195 48 152 160	If he sings the magic words, all possibilities will be open to him.

161	201 124 58 213 202 145 204 211 114 149 161	The mountains in our country are inspiring to thousands with their majestic beauty.
161	43 8 9 214 16 165 207 46 130 151 161	The plane stood eternal over the very beaches it once strafed in battle
161	122 164 123 127 168 83 154 20 165 133 161	I feel so badly for the poor animal they're shooting at.
161	73 11 167 137 160 76 50 35 146 206 161	These are some gifted cheerleaders.
161	182 69 151 144 75 204 109 16 120 213 161	They are a couple of nice guys.
161	30 129 165 21 27 38 42 95 197 148 161	What a nice environment.

161	29 2 194 71 102 172 156 101 34 25 161	The symbol shows only three lions from the front, but the truth is a strong lion is behind them!

161	187 158 34 137 108 95 87 102 13 192 161	Seeing stuff like this makes me feel very proud of our soldiers fighting for our freedom
161	190 143 8 158 137 104 162 21 63 30 161	The peacefulness of the water is something everyone should see in person.
161	150 145 127 144 137 177 119 194 74 23 161	What a serene and inviting place.
161	100 163 134 215 6 22 68 118 69 98 161	I'm remember when I was a little girl and I was playing outside, It was a beautiful day.
161	87 143 85 55 115 17 32 7 77 40 161	I think she needs a better pair of shoes, maybe something a bit more warm.
161	68 102 185 9 58 125 152 75 155 130 161	That poor man must be in a lot of pain :(
161	55 37 145 149 140 79 178 215 164 41 161	This doesn't smell or look very good, but I am going to eat it because John made it.
161	10 162 204 65 126 132 171 167 174 138 161	My condolences go out to anyone LGBT+ who has ever suffered at the hands of homophobes.
161	112 199 184 109 23 192 62 160 18 73 161	What a cutie! She's learning new skills and having fun!
161	105 163 81 210 138 26 148 133 69 103 161	i wonder what that woman is thinking about
161	72 140 34 110 165 93 43 56 126 160 161	That color would look so good on a bedroom wall.
161	129 200 204 59 16 162 208 70 63 86 161	Great to see three good friends enjoying their time together.
161	93 118 39 99 38 8 59 10 77 162 161	What a comfortable chair!

161	150 176 130 210 139 144 203 146 84 68 161	What a kind person to feed the birds.
161	130 36 146 87 200 25 116 21 62 110 161	He is a great rider!
161	170 127 184 87 191 103 142 146 120 144 161	I'm glad he was able to have a statute constructed in his honor
161	76 132 69 149 105 124 2 144 33 212 161	The symbol was used by the family for centuries.
161	213 3 200 135 119 99 140 178 22 13 161	The hotel is one of the best in the local area I used to always go to it as a child.
161	136 130 32 148 195 205 105 169 203 112 161	I'm so glad to see her still using the same methods she used as a child.
161	48 75 152 53 110 132 78 141 76 8 161	These people can sit on my lap as a chair.
161	15 183 194 36 42 69 165 58 14 107 161	I hope they catch some fish.
161	143 49 184 38 145 136 43 101 77 118 161	I hope she's doing ok.
161	143 83 110 188 75 26 146 171 153 164 161	The artist is very talented
161	196 143 125 101 28 88 140 74 57 21 161	I wish she could have got something much better than that.
161	138 198 65 118 120 145 183 139 211 171 161	This beautiful bird is exactly why we need to take care of nature.
161	188 99 146 211 71 56 15 119 213 143 161	I'm glad that fish has a beautiful home.
161	166 107 30 61 40 88 27 105 157 22 161	What an adorable child... they are our future
161	162 13 209 5 79 52 122 25 213 119 161	What a colorful space for a meeting of the minds!
161	14 80 27 155 190 10 102 128 101 105 161	I cant wait to spend my Saturday making this tidy for my mom
161	35 41 40 91 151 8 51 64 11 106 161	I'm doing my best to show some compassion for a fan of One Piece.
161	6 42 193 174 44 168 48 71 160 20 161	That poor elephant.  It must feel trapped on display all the time.
161	142 62 32 84 187 186 58 91 88 140 161	I love trees they are so good to us, everyone dont forget we need trees to survive
161	156 198 185 117 192 40 45 154 144 7 161	What a delicious view they have to gander upon.
161	107 146 36 12 151 178 43 116 174 76 161	We hear you
161	51 189 98 182 60 28 69 61 153 174 161	He may be alone, but it looks like he's having a relaxing time.
161	173 133 119 94 189 52 50 148 61 81 161	Wow, she is most definitely a beautiful lady. That dress is incredible on her amazing body.
161	75 32 92 144 199 36 13 26 80 136 161	I would do anything to spend one day with everyone I love in a beautiful place like this.
161	98 199 106 89 121 114 96 124 179 51 161	I feel such an overflowing sense of love.
161	139 13 40 86 9 36 196 76 19 195 161	These two look so happy together!
161	84 191 28 58 55 110 159 215 30 50 161	She is a true visionary and a caring individual, I support her!
161	166 87 58 24 4 11 158 183 107 195 161	This romantic couple seem to be enjoying themselves quite nicely.
161	144 95 170 66 206 100 38 22 175 7 161	All types of creatures will call this place home.
161	176 173 126 147 98 75 63 89 67 170 161	A great meal being enjoyed by these two.
161	156 191 13 57 148 199 178 152 99 25 161	looks like a caring massage
161	13 171 113 5 125 77 135 202 111 63 161	getting people together is the mot important thing in life.
161	125 150 78 174 165 117 148 140 132 130 161	race car in track
161	185 26 127 2 199 128 160 194 193 167 161	This is a lovely couple.
161	204 67 191 4 106 18 149 197 104 10 161	The reflection of the water make e feel the beauty all around us.
161	84 214 81 90 92 5 134 44 42 162 161	This plant makes me feel comfortable.
161	46 133 194 82 154 156 71 39 22 177 161	Punching people should only be used in self-defense, but I understand if they've hurt you.
161	47 122 155 86 171 212 103 182 44 91 161	This looks like le petit prince, which is one of the most heartfelt and lovely books i've ever read.
161	186 35 133 80 190 1 134 55 18 187 161	This bird just wants to eat
161	192 92 175 41 49 95 1 169 5 104 161	I hope he gets what he needs from this presentation.
161	97 38 144 206 20 11 209 17 14 167 161	I feel for her.
161	52 200 106 164 203 136 105 183 128 181 161	This landscape just makes my heart beat in my chest with love for our great country, I am so happy to be an American.
161	186 68 102 182 117 160 107 38 50 122 161	He looks happy
161	181 83 60 133 21 76 85 192 63 6 161	What a beautiful display of love and appreciation.
161	60 135 75 77 99 120 11 167 169 85 161	I feel so sorry for the man living behind that wall.
161	94 125 159 183 85 160 33 154 151 99 161	no one lives here since the murder
161	172 167 28 122 82 94 76 3 40 41 161	I bet he worked hard for those skills
161	40 200 174 207 21 128 185 11 152 212 161	I really feel sorry for those girls having to play sport in the mud.
161	50 132 170 146 83 53 159 85 114 21 161	He's been waiting for this game for years.
161	83 171 169 54 40 211 101 22 203 181 161	The furniture in this photo highlight the space of the room.
161	176 201 5 67 18 38 1 133 84 96 161	What beautiful architecture!
161	123 190 91 53 131 39 12 25 17 70 161	I care a lot about the relationship of other men.
161	150 197 136 32 64 117 205 6 53 207 161	I really hope those models get paid enough and eat enough on a daily basis.
161	42 183 106 47 211 15 36 127 186 176 161	Such a cute little plushie.
161	31 42 95 133 193 180 120 10 97 174 161	The blue shade on the door is calming and relaxing to look at.
161	31 64 13 75 155 197 149 22 61 195 161	I hope he doesn't get hit by the ball
161	37 91 206 164 46 109 50 25 135 160 161	A very good try at a photo. Maybe focus it a bit more next time :)
161	92 127 11 101 46 68 3 15 14 190 161	This guy looks super nice.
161	16 121 213 83 41 214 97 46 51 105 161	I hope these people all have a safe fun time
161	215 127 17 200 141 100 44 102 117 34 161	I feel bad for whoever has to clean that hibachi.
161	100 158 30 131 57 89 67 181 62 115 161	That is a very lovely  desert that someone went through the trouble of making.
161	134 157 20 40 125 168 71 110 97 178 161	I bet they're all so tired!
161	49 56 76 88 18 104 124 151 52 152 161	Nice to see loved ones make time for each other
162	143 124 89 178 179 197 38 136 69 22 162	This pathway holds the answers to many questions.
162	144 64 74 131 71 68 24 91 105 99 162	This is an evil creature worshipped by few.
162	32 111 172 117 42 149 179 154 10 198 162	They are probably ordering takeout.
162	194 30 4 66 79 148 96 185 186 33 162	Being homeless in a place with rich people.
162	167 61 4 126 112 43 198 178 64 93 162	This man loves monkey statues.
162	133 45 188 49 169 17 154 63 179 205 162	He shouldn't do that anymore.
162	51 193 126 127 150 194 11 184 140 151 162	Swimming competition i presume?
162	117 197 24 36 148 172 99 122 79 55 162	This is a sad place to be.
162	85 108 45 28 161 80 26 87 47 177 162	That looks like a good place for reflection.
162	42 31 89 23 59 196 208 100 153 71 162	This dog's outward joy mirrors my own, but I wonder if his inner self harbors the same dread sadness that mine does.
162	147 124 11 78 84 174 128 117 62 195 162	the range looks peaceful
162	142 164 55 95 143 66 15 46 133 13 162	I just get the feeling that the song they are playing is sad...
162	163 197 7 108 151 140 54 100 165 166 162	What an interesting set up.
162	129 82 155 148 38 5 138 201 16 63 162	The game is not very formal
162	194 21 207 174 62 156 101 64 85 89 162	Looks like you are all alone.
162	97 207 94 73 12 78 126 92 127 55 162	Hard at work as usual.
162	94 118 183 52 124 82 137 42 117 48 162	The view of the store is majestic
162	123 9 172 171 95 117 16 59 153 90 162	This is a baseball game.  Runs will score, outs will be made, but it won't change anything.
162	134 28 13 141 81 138 200 149 125 4 162	These two look so uncomfortable, it makes me feel sad.
162	214 208 87 9 60 204 111 65 78 39 162	It is sad how few musicians we see these days.
162	167 169 76 106 127 85 215 67 83 86 162	Industrialization is killing the environment.
162	120 71 52 158 192 128 21 76 194 51 162	That is so tall.  It probably guides travelers along.
162	74 17 123 67 23 24 105 202 184 13 162	These flowers are nice, very nice.
162	88 133 126 164 37 66 46 59 54 163 162	A serious rocking band
162	145 69 140 142 139 89 198 192 172 3 162	That building looks in poor condition. Also, the sign is very disturbing to see.
162	39 145 196 59 154 163 180 113 29 97 162	This photo doesn't look like the men are having very much much fun.
162	118 6 179 28 40 5 202 147 177 104 162	Thank you for sharing this image. It was a tough day for all of us, but we will NEVER FORGET their bravery and sacrifice
162	77 81 171 137 168 108 104 213 143 112 162	This town never really has much going on.  It feels almost stuck in time.
162	188 200 39 88 59 136 134 95 24 180 162	Do you think hardware on the bottom shelf is lonely?
162	139 150 99 116 36 169 60 64 53 167 162	I think she has only ever been out once.
162	91 51 151 54 116 12 29 207 138 82 162	The gray streets look so depressing.
162	175 100 209 103 54 145 6 27 25 152 162	This looks pretty loud...
162	11 180 190 62 91 183 5 191 110 181 162	This appears to be a formal gathering.
162	140 129 176 105 37 197 11 40 116 44 162	What lovely design, it's like art.
162	35 7 93 59 51 45 206 12 182 83 162	What a lovely view, I love nature.
162	114 44 124 73 164 117 26 159 180 4 162	Tall buildings make me reflect on 9-11.
162	66 171 44 19 121 97 206 85 110 94 162	I think this is a good time to reflect on how short life is.
162	115 70 138 203 97 150 141 117 164 128 162	The town overlooking the water can look so gloomy at times.
162	142 19 167 157 28 207 108 8 140 57 162	This looks like a great group of people!
162	112 105 52 87 83 35 72 46 5 142 162	What a peaceful place for birds.
162	102 134 179 17 155 136 58 146 140 194 162	I guess I have seen prettier buildings.
162	30 124 211 199 195 110 123 113 192 103 162	This spider knows how to weave.
162	67 46 121 96 40 8 163 156 39 145 162	What a dark, lonely looking mountain.
162	94 214 165 140 92 209 66 55 188 196 162	This is a beautiful plaza. Would be a great place to sit and relax, maybe read a book out in the open.
162	172 205 7 75 85 175 102 90 54 76 162	Street painting is a lost art
162	130 51 67 32 172 31 137 24 66 65 162	Night life meditation
162	104 159 18 85 59 14 149 87 195 119 162	He is not a happy baby, they only left him one piece of food.
162	179 104 100 192 110 54 126 206 180 120 162	what a beautiful nighr.
162	99 156 82 181 160 212 18 178 205 57 162	I feel so alone every time I go to this park
162	148 16 103 156 161 81 158 37 110 141 162	The view looks dull
162	95 151 62 156 107 105 93 56 49 103 162	Those people do not look very engaged in that activity.  How sad that is for them.
162	158 29 32 128 140 30 107 34 114 187 162	Such a disgusting place
162	97 75 184 115 76 165 156 119 61 108 162	Could be more interesting things going on at the stadium
162	102 13 9 104 202 3 56 156 64 83 162	Alone in this world, with my truck.
162	1 190 15 66 198 76 156 23 48 59 162	I wonder where they are at. They seem to be in a church of some sort?

162	190 122 141 22 182 11 7 132 180 133 162	That was a sad day when we lost the game.
162	123 172 78 47 153 214 49 150 170 140 162	Uh,oh...that look means they've done something.
162	173 196 107 119 190 86 124 24 164 61 162	Nothing replaces getting together with friends and having some fun! Sports also have a way of bringing people together!
162	64 175 152 40 137 170 163 183 69 148 162	It's a skull. The image of my death.
162	94 125 63 23 22 93 8 12 30 48 162	Here lies, a weird purple creature.

162	207 185 199 113 38 93 176 34 127 172 162	It's disheartening to see someone so miserable posing behind someone who is trying to appear happy.
162	2 135 48 187 26 208 24 160 155 202 162	These guys appear to be troublemakers.
162	183 44 169 127 1 99 55 165 176 92 162	That storm trooper feels like it is staring into my soul
162	140 124 148 204 189 163 115 42 127 57 162	This was the memorial kick to honor a teammate that died of cancer.

162	177 127 69 17 13 8 110 76 9 24 162	It's sad that they don't have a family restroom.
162	69 204 192 120 76 168 23 99 26 108 162	The details of th is painting must have taken ages to complete, it's very professional and elegant.

162	35 63 187 127 139 133 195 206 90 185 162	That rain is depressing and dreary.
162	28 6 121 124 57 15 34 98 214 152 162	Wow, i wonder why my date left me?
162	155 103 196 6 92 24 101 147 177 180 162	Two men face each other in mock battle. A century or two ago, the smiles and laughter would have been replaced by the cries from the wounded as two men fought bravely for their lives.
162	5 40 73 18 164 170 75 144 195 89 162	I worry so much about how he might hurt himself by falling off of the table.
162	165 65 140 70 90 105 104 85 112 126 162	so upsetting to see so many clothes gone to waste..

162	201 70 136 106 152 148 184 119 32 11 162	This salad is very oily,i will think hard whether to eat it or not.
162	204 168 29 11 147 119 214 151 83 84 162	These colors remind me of my recently passed grandparents.

162	147 149 57 5 4 97 102 160 205 13 162	Deep sea fishing can be a dangerous occupation, many have been injured and even lost their lives doing it.
162	189 79 86 122 205 19 129 158 145 193 162	My dad played guitar before he passed. RIP.
162	89 34 124 180 158 90 174 207 109 21 162	This would be a perfect place to sit and meditate and pray.
162	30 96 24 62 184 57 60 29 150 179 162	Life started like this.
162	195 39 2 116 106 6 138 83 123 33 162	Food is life.

162	209 20 47 29 10 89 84 125 76 161 162	I wouldn't be so scared at this point in the ride.
162	147 87 92 73 6 189 159 53 183 47 162	That uniform is kind of weird.

162	95 85 160 8 50 82 161 49 34 178 162	This is really sad to see.
162	115 98 136 183 159 112 41 127 82 215 162	So dark and gloomy...
162	41 29 137 180 72 183 17 100 102 169 162	Good photography. Great use of filter. The color scheme works to evoke a certain emotion.

162	154 146 193 185 115 5 117 2 112 210 162	Human skulls are not the best of sights. They instill feelings of fear of death whenever I come across such.
162	84 59 197 113 153 10 112 27 54 61 162	Just another moment of my life staring at a screen.

162	161 32 157 2 4 39 115 60 48 55 162	This makes me sad.

163	20 182 78 180 199 129 127 110 3 174 163	I hope someone is watching those bikes so they don't get stolen.
163	121 66 103 100 165 164 98 97 126 180 163	I wish I could hold the dear child in my arms.
163	20 128 93 177 58 157 199 138 91 193 163	the man in this photo would not hurt a fly
163	116 209 32 81 128 119 129 9 43 110 163	Aw, this is a lovely photo. That was a great going away party and now everyone is soooo sleepy. This is so nice.
163	125 201 141 37 179 160 35 195 51 149 163	The neutral palette lends itself to tranquility.
163	33 11 9 84 148 89 6 72 42 31 163	Soft breezes blowing through the palm trees on a beautiful day.
163	81 156 71 79 143 197 8 194 211 59 163	This color is like a hug, it is warm and I love it
163	39 148 92 50 210 58 60 165 96 14 163	I love watching the stream slowly flow
163	22 210 80 202 177 117 25 189 179 57 163	He's looking over the ocean at sunset while he talks to someone on the phone. I bet it's someone he cares a lot about.
163	118 129 193 71 195 58 85 32 56 1 163	This man works at the park and is allowed to bring his dog with him.  The kids love it.
163	204 10 38 153 156 159 203 211 72 174 163	The couple is having so much fun together.
163	33 194 19 106 144 20 102 69 100 185 163	Nature affords us such beauty...
163	79 39 201 205 84 13 17 144 81 186 163	I'd like to walk along that shrubbery and just slowly run my hand along its leaves.
163	56 113 78 177 188 160 112 150 8 95 163	She looks like she has a good business.
163	100 123 43 129 39 189 146 128 60 64 163	What a different piece of art.
163	210 99 93 51 204 149 16 47 113 96 163	It's sad to think about the barbaric slaughter of the cows that are made into these burgers. We need to be kinder to the animals on this planet.
163	135 198 165 16 189 169 181 65 77 191 163	Wonder what on earth this says?
163	131 99 114 165 56 72 92 10 118 61 163	Her hair is beautiful.
163	43 93 86 91 189 172 133 1 132 88 163	I politely asked my friend to drive slower.
163	54 202 129 30 188 153 27 7 150 52 163	This is a nice car, it matches the color of grass.
163	201 29 132 160 124 145 131 81 89 205 163	This band is got the party riled up.
163	200 169 172 162 80 39 63 146 45 199 163	This color reminds me of babies!
163	208 113 168 67 152 32 37 35 9 156 163	This church reminds me of the one I was baptized in.
163	181 46 111 132 68 187 45 30 54 147 163	What a neat pen, I want one.
163	201 39 3 83 134 90 137 127 126 38 163	I hope that the humorous sign keeps people away.
163	4 188 213 146 194 44 189 45 180 177 163	What a nice family enjoying the moment of opening gifts on Christmas morning.
163	189 102 2 106 157 83 80 8 66 139 163	I'm so glad they put padded straps on this backpack to make it more comfortable for me.
163	36 183 189 133 86 61 71 185 157 52 163	I love sitting with nature and appreciating new life!
163	196 46 153 53 192 202 129 72 58 137 163	The waves are nice to look at
163	115 117 18 13 92 203 102 96 179 45 163	This building sticks out, yet somehow blends softly into the sky.
163	76 101 27 90 121 13 29 59 94 70 163	Look how scarce the clouds are
163	143 118 82 207 20 3 6 98 45 66 163	The man is giving a nice speech
163	133 79 130 77 116 123 103 18 45 44 163	What beautiful, delicate flowers.
163	23 113 60 132 56 95 191 150 26 165 163	Wow, lovely photo.
163	60 16 108 194 153 63 56 132 69 79 163	I love old cars
163	89 109 145 9 13 68 67 189 152 50 163	Always be kind to others; even when they are different.
163	75 79 37 90 211 160 137 151 109 165 163	This church is a very pretty shade of white.
163	155 215 50 60 149 97 205 143 69 170 163	And tables for everyone
163	9 29 112 63 69 113 184 133 88 90 163	Wow, that's too many people
163	55 174 61 198 147 57 3 8 211 144 163	The animal is so cute!
163	159 20 141 19 210 76 116 138 198 213 163	Gracefully jumping in the water.
163	80 55 110 168 49 199 102 176 164 149 163	It's good to see good in the world.
163	131 133 212 174 59 208 113 23 46 157 163	Next time, need a better route to protect the cows.
163	182 179 52 14 33 70 46 93 62 139 163	These guys look very intelligent, they must be having a good conversation on the topic.
163	108 175 113 77 84 206 138 147 198 159 163	Building a dam across river is very good idea to conserve water in case of draught
163	164 179 210 187 76 170 77 154 60 44 163	She is explaining things very politely.
163	5 91 195 57 98 153 196 54 100 22 163	smooth roads like highways with less traffic and sunny weather are the best conditions to drive
163	44 137 146 193 50 182 1 132 36 134 163	if it comes to travel,expenses should not be the primary thing but the comfort will come first according to me
163	91 99 76 130 137 214 70 151 109 26 163	What a beautiful picture
163	77 206 39 212 51 53 40 190 60 73 163	Building is tough, but done right it can provide an ample home for a kind family
163	205 211 183 155 187 86 45 138 20 154 163	The picture is a tiny tiny bit gray for me, sorry for that
163	63 51 75 172 170 8 12 44 36 203 163	This color has a calming effect for me.
163	181 16 215 58 166 208 110 56 12 80 163	I want to pet the cats.
163	135 9 172 1 189 182 86 35 65 185 163	A good speech can come from a kind mind.
163	78 164 135 180 149 178 30 11 169 94 163	He seems like a disciplined man.
163	31 148 50 155 36 175 115 65 56 179 163	That harbor must not be too busy.
163	12 5 114 156 47 90 120 128 33 185 163	Don't be afraid!
163	136 197 10 160 117 80 90 91 124 159 163	All the exhibits are so fragile I hope none of them break.
163	131 125 158 196 190 150 53 151 48 164 163	Its so calm and peaceful in this room right now.
163	139 195 201 49 11 78 170 131 194 129 163	This building is rather delicate.
163	142 12 107 132 136 62 95 63 198 168 163	Please be careful, you should be wearing a helmet!
163	180 143 116 194 97 207 35 205 147 50 163	His talent is so rare, hope he has tons of success.
163	67 204 186 97 16 37 51 7 166 50 163	A lovely place!
163	99 104 172 30 113 2 100 44 154 1 163	Oh what a sweet little muffin baby!
163	129 86 98 71 48 105 194 117 20 9 163	Such a beautiful and classic piece of art
163	62 132 96 82 44 134 4 205 42 20 163	Everyone should be safe on the tram yet enjoy the view.
163	32 161 51 63 181 44 103 47 42 54 163	What a nice area to take a walk in.
163	114 164 179 109 186 143 118 193 152 26 163	Let's all float around for a few days.
163	170 95 194 54 178 209 70 1 204 93 163	Such special dirt looks so beautiful
163	207 186 17 136 42 211 76 12 206 215 163	Look how cute, innocent and defenseless this animal seem to be.
163	40 126 139 186 94 97 64 41 7 121 163	Such a peaceful image, it speaks to me in so many ways. It's framed so well and the colors make me feel so comfortable.
163	79 15 162 70 191 160 117 120 55 82 163	Sledding is such a wonderful childhood memory to have.
163	111 123 108 147 63 82 38 150 207 209 163	I hope they are careful.
163	165 206 97 152 179 125 166 201 178 135 163	What a lovely puppy! And a seeing-eye dog in training too. Lovely.
163	134 125 212 209 63 150 43 109 172 81 163	I would love to fill this basket with kittens,
163	112 35 105 103 18 125 101 129 189 139 163	I hope this ship isn't about to go to war. I'd be worried about someone being injured!
163	120 176 11 135 178 92 89 88 139 146 163	What a sweet looking child
163	187 202 80 38 209 123 69 130 189 45 163	I like how everyone shares the sidewalk. They all look so happy!
163	95 197 50 8 125 97 55 142 38 136 163	Hope you're being safe!
163	31 2 73 115 111 24 13 209 28 153 163	I think they are probably playing some relaxing, sweet music
163	96 212 162 108 70 166 94 39 26 180 163	Such a lovely statue, I bet the artist worked hard on it.

163	112 42 74 79 84 88 194 64 36 87 163	This little house is so cute and tiny.
163	18 185 98 166 108 57 179 82 193 59 163	I would much rather place a bike on a kick stands.  Bikes are precious to me.
163	77 103 183 97 20 143 174 145 39 131 163	I love landscapes, this one seems to have been carefully carved by erosion over time, how pretty!
163	211 193 37 65 62 194 164 13 119 69 163	These are aesthetic stairs.
163	19 177 150 71 97 42 104 214 191 159 163	what a nice time
163	48 8 17 94 67 119 120 12 22 89 163	Green is the color of nature, it is a serene and cool color, I like to look at green landscapes to relax
163	99 10 214 125 54 26 14 137 143 7 163	There's genuine appreciation in his eyes.
163	193 87 48 37 63 98 127 190 180 135 163	Sweet, kind, and perfectly placed.
163	78 133 113 154 92 200 185 202 83 178 163	These guys look like they're about to have a wonderful time.
163	137 177 71 195 180 38 96 174 113 100 163	This is a nice scene.
163	1 67 2 38 171 46 137 88 9 210 163	the twisting flow is like a relaxing puzzle for my eyes.
163	118 102 126 14 97 199 23 131 65 193 163	I want to get hot cocoa and blankets for when the skiers come back!
163	169 127 107 197 64 178 66 99 187 70 163	That man is tenderly touching the other man
163	117 127 189 77 205 25 70 67 46 186 163	Looks like the perfect day for a walk and to stop and smell the flowers

163	52 181 182 169 9 89 94 125 60 149 163	Dennis must be a kind teacher, allowing a lengthy period of time for the exam.
163	133 95 138 46 180 62 4 94 22 13 163	He looks scared, poor thing.
163	14 43 65 57 195 56 190 6 164 80 163	Beautiful girl in a beautiful spot.
163	50 193 81 94 55 214 119 111 139 27 163	Those two men look so sweet.

163	71 195 135 186 160 36 210 153 182 192 163	Lets see what there is going on.
163	198 154 70 194 184 148 182 64 170 100 163	The town is really caring to it's inhabitants.  Everyone there is very nice.
163	4 198 38 166 206 66 215 13 82 129 163	Despite the luxuriousness I bet the engine purrs like a little kitten
163	141 85 7 50 195 135 207 170 167 46 163	The police have the hardest job and i respect them

163	102 83 188 191 91 20 47 26 153 158 163	The environment is serene and beautiful.
163	167 195 118 89 86 92 80 47 62 166 163	That skyline looks so peaceful and clear, it really relaxes me.
163	144 173 19 11 35 195 78 215 212 194 163	I love how the light is softly glowing on the building in the center.
163	110 140 26 45 43 182 17 86 125 29 163	The group of people support each other and give a sense of community.
163	105 145 2 11 7 179 37 98 150 164 163	I would like to lay down a sleeping bag and stare up at the sky all night. I bet there is such a splendid view there without any light pollution
163	171 148 119 147 67 118 170 98 107 77 163	It looks like these young teens are getting ready to learn something important.

163	21 190 28 64 121 111 193 86 57 196 163	Sometimes we forget all the people whose effort goes into TV behind the scenes.  We should thank them.
163	12 140 160 58 33 18 51 116 71 112 163	Playing water games with friends is good time, I feel relaxed.
163	37 58 48 148 180 173 130 208 36 111 163	Actually babe, this is not iceland, it is ireland, we can go visit my darling!
163	44 90 46 161 22 97 102 130 143 126 163	Nothing like a quiet day on the lake.

163	106 132 43 29 76 14 90 12 147 56 163	The bread is soft and warm with lightly toasted nuts on top, such wonderful comfort food.
163	209 169 31 133 144 152 55 114 76 48 163	Kids are innocent and playful, love to spend time with them.
163	185 114 12 184 2 169 182 186 74 215 163	Loving sons I'm sure.
163	50 15 173 115 24 185 72 214 18 82 163	I want to climb up there and find the little bird hiding up there.  I would pick it up very carefully.
163	104 122 51 198 87 120 32 181 81 153 163	he carefully strums the cello
163	109 137 36 190 206 151 101 196 25 52 163	I really like art work made out of cutlery and this one is particularly nice as I can't see any dangerous knives.
163	153 38 175 110 183 103 28 74 50 156 163	the snow is softly hitting the ground
163	122 193 186 109 147 140 71 153 184 80 163	Fall trees tickling the sky.
163	93 8 126 53 87 203 83 125 160 109 163	It looks like these people are having a nice calm lunch.  I wish I could join them.
163	94 159 209 82 117 97 5 194 22 47 163	It's okay, we all fall down at first!
163	197 203 160 125 25 181 57 30 182 154 163	She has a nice soft smile.
163	147 45 158 67 191 198 192 1 172 109 163	The area is calm in appearance.
163	62 179 193 175 66 158 180 99 9 165 163	I worry about the poor people in floods like this.
163	168 186 133 26 11 61 136 21 8 152 163	We should clap to encourage her.
163	89 174 105 209 167 164 123 50 20 71 163	This is a very good photo :)
163	48 209 79 146 18 51 69 78 186 85 163	Her flowers are all grown.  She has a green thumb.

163	20 207 30 144 215 69 17 60 203 115 163	Don't eat too many hot dogs. They're not good for you.
163	170 212 106 205 107 62 164 137 173 119 163	What a smooth and peaceful color.
163	44 195 30 141 189 57 91 122 212 151 163	The way the first car shows so many curves and bends lends quite a bit of life to it's aesthetic.
163	25 102 174 100 125 16 47 17 51 183 163	One must be delicate when handling mushrooms, to avoid sickness

163	2 40 59 171 184 99 67 103 153 212 163	I hope he bends his knees when he lands.
163	110 204 41 31 49 213 130 206 175 106 163	I home these people are drinking plenty of water.
163	111 184 90 15 58 132 5 93 98 60 163	Well I guess everyone has a right to express their opinion, and what harm is there carrying a sign?
163	191 121 97 32 18 51 139 19 190 109 163	This fellow looks like he had a fall and needs someone to carefully lift pick him up and make sure he isn't hurt.
163	124 202 168 34 203 104 134 74 156 1 163	I wish I could give everyone in this crowd a caress and a soft foot rub.
163	107 11 95 57 129 80 51 126 128 159 163	Nothing better than a soothing jazz saxophone after a long day. Slow and Steady, so relaxing and easy on the ears
163	64 174 129 89 97 141 146 96 150 19 163	Well fresh is good
163	108 13 148 23 143 140 173 162 34 71 163	I'd like to hear the soothing music coming from that horn.
163	79 184 112 183 115 71 113 16 82 17 163	Bee's are such simple creatures.
163	63 30 35 14 144 50 21 84 103 67 163	I'm sure he's a great guitar player.

163	48 151 200 105 62 116 35 34 156 53 163	The architecture just makes me feels so calm and relaxed at this time of day.
163	209 191 125 114 17 113 63 6 153 84 163	I'm going to cheer that dog up!  I love dogs, I'm going to give him a soft rub.
163	190 48 208 126 95 3 179 157 45 201 163	What a cute little moustached kitty!
163	144 9 47 62 78 213 46 121 89 75 163	Soft and lovely yellow flowers in the light.
163	57 1 99 28 126 63 30 168 55 11 163	This looks like a lovely place to visit.
163	10 161 55 200 169 80 205 34 128 57 163	He looks so cute!
164	188 73 62 38 19 34 101 103 209 162 164	The man is crossing traffic.
164	138 35 13 10 135 63 194 42 148 58 164	This person is very brave to ski.
164	19 92 71 168 205 20 200 145 16 149 164	Once I land, the boycotting will begin!
164	68 165 18 84 106 209 141 214 193 151 164	I really need to meet these people!
164	197 7 177 112 136 151 54 124 61 44 164	What a handsome kitten, he will grow large.
164	72 184 88 108 68 25 26 99 142 42 164	I have agoraphobia but I will attend the game
164	89 40 150 106 142 125 181 9 140 117 164	An unbelievable picture of a coming storm dropping to the ocean.
164	136 214 202 141 43 185 5 179 33 162 164	I'd ride a bike like that through any rough weather if something needed to be done.
164	90 26 125 53 124 179 207 165 105 25 164	This looks like the kind of room where my daring adventure will begin!
164	58 196 141 43 89 15 21 5 156 102 164	The bird is very brave to walk on water
164	83 51 202 214 37 72 157 130 169 201 164	I'd love to play on stage some day to a crowd of people like this.
164	124 92 2 117 175 69 205 38 81 109 164	I really want to visit this city!
164	69 56 8 72 169 210 67 48 139 196 164	I find it brave to drink strong alcohol
164	29 199 78 44 210 91 195 99 74 76 164	I would love to visit thier native country.
164	64 55 144 168 6 28 193 185 210 40 164	I love eating salads for every meal!
164	210 120 135 2 83 131 99 133 130 58 164	Never let a big obstacle stand in your way to get to the beauty you seek.
164	163 53 139 201 143 74 118 160 58 2 164	This flower will grow, and use up every droplet to become even bigger. It may not have water in its vase, but it will make it!
164	8 185 42 146 43 157 117 197 64 98 164	I'd be honored to present such a beautiful flower to my love.
164	120 85 211 151 105 130 205 122 21 57 164	I would like nothing more than to take these fresh picked berries to people in poverty areas for nourishment.
164	112 144 205 150 58 199 166 65 85 98 164	It is brave to go up in a balloon
164	8 182 100 95 77 103 163 153 211 115 164	I'd love to go on a road trip with no destination in mind.
164	163 178 165 69 89 4 59 28 172 80 164	Space is an empty, unknown void and, for the betterment of mankind, I want to fly explore it.
164	113 52 3 203 211 188 90 50 184 75 164	Looks like a daring place to go! Hop you go on adventures!
164	2 175 157 38 82 30 56 207 181 182 164	If the fire alarm goes off, I'm making sure every person is out of the building before I leave. Even if the fire's raging.
164	181 33 197 196 183 191 143 6 195 146 164	Such a cutie! I would defend her against the whole world!
164	27 11 177 58 159 145 37 174 29 149 164	This bird can fly really high. I'm jealous.
164	51 105 181 195 177 15 72 194 162 209 164	I would love to build this!
164	185 124 159 90 14 78 208 29 176 70 164	She could use some pants, i'd give her doll pants.
164	27 136 69 171 179 5 146 67 8 158 164	Do you like this vegans?
164	163 100 193 78 4 126 152 210 161 109 164	I can not believe you are going to jump the fence to get our ball.  Did you see the size of the guard dog!?
164	90 100 97 25 120 182 107 69 31 98 164	Beautiful couple. We have to be confident enough to approach and pursue the people we like, even if we're nervous. But if you want love, you have to be bold!
164	33 16 145 55 34 24 32 110 89 167 164	I would replace this one with a better door and lock.
164	62 186 169 168 202 25 130 128 21 67 164	I would pick that flower even if it was poisonous.
164	88 149 48 190 2 93 146 85 103 174 164	Although it was a financial risk, I stepped up to my dream and opened my own business.
164	209 154 55 42 10 168 112 174 4 73 164	Such a beautiful image. Love the intensity on the musician's face. You can tell the artist is really engaged with their music.
164	84 168 56 91 159 32 63 60 105 30 164	No fear! Get out there and show them who's boss!
164	59 182 112 157 212 96 78 58 198 85 164	Wow, great diet, I need to go on one too.
164	109 69 200 104 5 24 199 195 49 187 164	she has a face of a courageous person
164	26 73 195 21 163 93 65 144 211 33 164	That must have took skill to make, wow.
164	120 69 5 209 86 30 73 103 27 135 164	These are neat, I would like to try making them.
164	21 124 115 9 156 159 45 199 17 194 164	You have to be brave to go outside here.
164	160 43 90 88 81 130 175 173 31 36 164	I am inspired by this scene.
164	151 200 138 173 163 75 100 176 147 69 164	Next in line to do the zipline! Wish me luck!
164	87 44 111 79 160 2 131 158 97 191 164	She is braver than I would be with all of the chocolate being counted!
164	148 34 78 13 94 101 69 176 11 10 164	i could run one side to another
164	117 82 16 113 144 165 89 170 7 194 164	Those carts are so brave for hanging out in the parking lot!
164	181 25 112 131 120 142 39 152 29 10 164	Could see myself marching into their offices to propose a new idea
164	76 107 170 15 173 52 150 62 174 92 164	Racing apps are the best, almost like the real life thing!!
164	19 37 153 158 34 40 175 108 169 4 164	I cant believe this is our last meeting before the triathalon
164	159 94 122 127 67 107 170 125 66 171 164	You don't eat 100% of the fish you don't try to catch. Never be afraid to get your feathers wet!
164	4 61 41 187 68 90 55 56 126 63 164	He is so brave to ride this long.
164	153 38 71 68 204 58 1 207 147 103 164	It takes a lot of guts to fly a jet.
164	23 138 166 205 62 31 91 187 87 114 164	He is tired out from a long day of protecting his family.
164	42 192 46 182 117 171 153 112 88 68 164	Such a magnificent animal, and very smart also.
164	13 155 17 67 61 46 180 22 58 208 164	I bet I could climb all the way to the top!
164	59 87 211 92 212 168 177 192 198 132 164	I would send a lot more money
164	68 6 197 162 115 153 33 201 89 125 164	Best friends forever, no matter what.
164	151 157 8 60 68 182 66 123 179 41 164	I'd love to snowmobile across that!
164	96 215 111 201 91 182 65 8 154 61 164	Now let's add some NOS to make it even faster, no matter the risk to the engine!
164	1 196 47 163 190 183 71 59 152 208 164	If I saw the world like this I would have to fight through it and push on.
164	135 97 63 32 21 12 131 180 142 181 164	This is how I live life! Always with the goal in mind and my hand outstretched to catch that ball!
164	88 23 83 123 20 157 62 93 162 18 164	This player is going for the goal.
164	159 122 184 179 70 193 75 11 201 191 164	it will be a daring act to go near to the fountain in public places like this
164	149 177 6 165 125 122 42 182 33 172 164	That is brave to be playing by those power lines.
164	158 113 54 213 180 65 105 195 207 127 164	I bet that would be a fun wall to climb.
164	181 49 160 201 90 91 25 154 24 144 164	I fancy trying to swim over there.
164	103 176 143 80 157 123 91 23 195 100 164	I'm gonna see if there's anything over this hill!
164	51 134 25 85 47 74 179 127 163 91 164	This people are standing up for their rights to be who they are, be it flamboyant or a smoker They are who they are!
164	183 192 146 179 40 50 157 167 136 197 164	its was really a bold attempt to construct
164	176 183 129 118 65 168 67 2 53 34 164	I will climb that one day.
164	206 19 131 86 163 36 90 172 167 137 164	It takes a lot to stand up in front of people and speak on what you truly believe in.
164	139 181 40 121 176 74 39 32 177 13 164	lets go feed homeless next weekend
164	185 42 49 178 12 152 113 170 7 61 164	You go girl!
164	160 176 53 24 54 33 123 71 202 57 164	This will be the first time I have wrestled in 30 year, here goes nothing!
164	101 56 115 123 130 185 207 201 44 67 164	Seems really dark to be wearing high heels, love it!
164	25 15 36 56 147 58 126 210 31 83 164	If they get robbed, I would protect them.
164	35 198 211 111 182 170 48 126 173 43 164	I could totally catch that bird
164	85 81 189 62 80 65 47 210 215 124 164	She's cute, I would ask her out
164	23 127 97 157 116 210 61 146 138 84 164	I want to travel here and climb to the top
164	207 76 176 206 58 8 89 44 158 110 164	Just keep walking .
164	61 204 119 52 129 200 140 18 62 208 164	Sweet park of monuments. Hidden gem.
164	6 161 206 3 143 15 121 10 111 104 164	I would love to enter into this place.
164	27 114 24 197 126 138 149 174 178 32 164	I never used to like shrimps much, but one day I gathered the guts to take the first bite; I have never looked back. Delicious!
164	90 155 3 101 148 17 178 84 34 131 164	I wish she was there.
164	206 119 77 196 29 158 154 117 9 67 164	I would want to just dive into the oceans like this fish and forget about my problems
164	57 25 139 146 95 13 148 16 85 79 164	I would spend a night alone in this haunted house.
164	181 65 151 202 58 106 200 145 94 119 164	You are brave if you were to cut the wire with your bear hands
164	90 175 152 12 3 46 142 201 49 50 164	Jump in bud! dont care about your body shape
164	205 15 175 142 157 136 77 173 135 192 164	I will be the best green canvas painter in the world!
164	109 148 158 123 173 189 129 110 51 112 164	Forget what might be lurking here, I'm going in.
164	36 92 6 102 162 5 100 96 144 169 164	Looks like she's ready to take on the world.
164	199 181 104 166 184 66 197 16 141 97 164	That street looks scary but I need to cross it.
164	212 202 51 114 139 197 6 187 179 54 164	Although it maybe unconventional. I will paint everything in the room with this color!
164	183 161 118 113 74 77 90 31 78 151 164	Blurry beautiful picture
164	208 75 16 49 166 60 127 41 209 139 164	the beauty of these tree sculptures must represent something of a higher power
164	14 144 78 10 142 151 45 114 104 58 164	Bit scary to shop at this time of day.
164	110 101 57 13 203 17 61 40 38 50 164	I am going to purchase this restaurant.
164	140 189 79 198 30 14 20 130 104 182 164	She will be able to stand up for what she believes in.
164	9 92 165 153 106 57 209 17 198 89 164	That mother duck is protecting her babies at all cost.
164	32 127 171 59 36 82 161 176 198 134 164	I will eventually fit into these shoes.
164	145 203 116 14 163 113 205 64 190 30 164	He was brave guy, lets change his location
164	116 66 122 213 167 119 175 27 160 17 164	Its amazing and daring stuff if I jump from a scary height and swim to the shore safely!
164	178 83 173 141 100 172 46 152 71 196 164	I wonder where this road leads.
164	88 141 206 174 138 195 171 62 157 197 164	I'd love to eat here!
164	213 202 200 173 60 214 174 4 116 189 164	This reminds me of the time I was traveling alone and there was a real unsettling feeling in the town. A war broke out right after I left. Scary!
164	196 61 80 163 131 43 24 16 48 140 164	This is a very important building
164	151 157 196 175 205 6 156 127 128 50 164	A dew dropped rose
164	67 177 83 141 64 195 92 138 174 89 164	That gentleman is aweful brave playing there, he may fall over the banister or slip on what looks like a wet floor.
164	96 69 7 188 146 83 16 27 70 202 164	Oh I would LOVE to jump off that helicopter!
164	108 45 13 145 193 160 205 43 41 125 164	What is he eating! It looks interesting!
164	53 94 46 191 118 51 198 145 36 162 164	I shudder to think of what's waiting on me at the top of these stairs, but I must complete my mission!
164	115 55 75 1 40 74 80 68 9 44 164	I would beat down anyone who tried to harass these women.
164	86 152 157 181 29 54 63 155 67 137 164	dont worry friend, i shall save you from this prison
164	15 208 52 173 36 64 106 110 107 4 164	Those women are so brave!
164	98 37 75 65 51 211 102 151 173 176 164	I should paint something nice over this.
164	133 90 203 191 29 9 50 183 73 177 164	It took a lot, but I finally registered for this class!
164	156 142 215 10 69 56 147 139 23 112 164	I want to climb that building!
164	19 151 35 84 20 211 122 166 102 174 164	I'd drink with these guys.
164	30 153 43 114 96 116 100 21 215 193 164	I am willing to move forward.
164	176 63 119 153 172 179 35 148 132 52 164	Look at those brave girls!
164	202 49 193 162 21 44 123 203 53 9 164	I want to help that man.
164	109 161 71 53 56 40 157 121 28 39 164	id climb that palm tree
164	213 81 24 200 103 64 169 105 204 79 164	There is probably a swarm of bees in the yard but that didn't stop him.
164	196 81 151 47 145 176 134 163 45 141 164	I would love to run for 10 miles down the beach no matter how hard it is.
164	200 170 40 20 73 29 206 103 69 114 164	That car will run through them!
164	114 56 93 70 107 101 86 31 19 113 164	The sun will shine on all of us in life.
164	14 207 69 206 62 30 213 104 116 200 164	I took all the steps possible to save this horse from it's sickness.
164	76 80 1 200 45 150 51 54 171 31 164	That plant is so brave.
164	188 52 173 18 156 60 83 1 119 70 164	I would like to be the first to paraglide over that gap!
164	215 213 188 167 145 60 171 87 57 82 164	Running across this field seems like a stretch because you could get attacked from all sides.
164	19 68 211 150 30 123 160 63 169 140 164	I wanna sleep alone under the stars here
164	174 72 135 9 132 24 205 86 20 47 164	I want to ask him out but I'm nervous
164	151 25 161 121 213 30 181 89 96 23 164	Those kids are our future. We have to protect them at all cost.
164	52 29 45 127 36 104 154 152 86 128 164	I would gladly stand in front of these guys and give a speech.
164	176 30 130 214 18 71 143 141 172 66 164	Even though you're not supposed to swim after eating, lets do it!
164	113 108 119 128 152 155 20 215 170 47 164	A saved a puppy on that bridge last winter
164	138 97 201 58 24 180 61 104 161 37 164	Confronting this man took guts, especially without backup
164	111 9 189 148 201 59 180 182 130 163 164	Even through this vicious hurricane, we will come together as one.
164	186 207 7 58 36 84 113 42 39 182 164	Looks like a staff meeting when the boss is telling someone off... I remember those days in restaurants, nothing that test you more like the fear of being yelled at in front of your coworkers haha
164	39 60 148 78 54 37 146 176 168 95 164	I once rode a zipline down a mountain that looked just like that...it was awesome!
164	94 52 190 22 81 146 18 210 167 74 164	And the sun rises for us to tackle a new day, in spite of any darkness.
164	185 205 51 47 10 207 42 48 136 155 164	That oman is so brave for wearing that dress
164	92 196 96 49 115 56 65 156 129 210 164	Not beautiful decoration
164	91 123 199 99 129 153 106 208 68 4 164	This purple reminds me of the purple heart I received during my time in the military.
164	77 83 166 173 72 159 49 142 50 54 164	The only bird left of its kind and he's not hiding.
164	72 207 191 192 52 44 15 171 182 75 164	Nice catch! I would love to put him on my frisbee team!
164	122 191 11 113 54 24 114 21 127 56 164	he is having more courageous
164	24 132 12 149 26 209 146 65 74 91 164	I would love to ride that animal.
164	138 129 203 68 105 170 158 195 214 181 164	I would love to eat everything on that buffet, but only if it is raw.
164	126 211 20 141 37 123 108 54 57 90 164	Even if it took me months, I could duplicate that.
164	153 102 57 41 63 5 152 14 92 16 164	So tempting to jump from roof to roof to clear the crowd.
164	141 152 115 127 154 158 67 165 1 57 164	I would hike through this at night all by myself!
164	69 49 122 134 42 139 87 204 121 77 164	They are brave to stand there.
164	124 49 187 158 110 70 112 90 113 195 164	They are brave for fixing that.
164	111 57 147 84 108 37 87 211 176 7 164	If I was an ice hockey player I'd probably play without a helmet.
164	18 8 210 133 46 93 17 182 7 92 164	Only few brave women take risk in life to explore the world, I am one among them!
164	45 6 14 140 99 162 53 98 186 188 164	Even on a bad day I keep my head high.
164	162 36 21 150 31 54 112 58 133 3 164	You go birds; dive down and you'll get one!
164	202 181 121 195 92 7 185 128 175 191 164	I think the person on this statue did amazing things.
164	89 185 119 30 12 2 172 7 163 184 164	Whoever walks these streets at night is very brave.
164	96 108 157 30 188 27 102 53 73 16 164	I want to try to climb from the bottom to the top of one of those flags.
164	140 101 115 184 102 93 1 162 201 186 164	They're riding for a charity.
164	118 151 36 158 163 83 134 13 99 137 164	Wouldn't it be a cool journey to grow a plant like this?
164	91 41 92 15 166 192 85 212 116 68 164	It requires guts to fight a strong opponent!
164	17 154 165 174 124 214 29 19 129 209 164	someone should swim across that
164	65 192 78 40 161 74 97 210 120 51 164	Im going into a battle
164	119 77 23 6 109 169 14 141 103 16 164	I think I could have a go at actually trying to pick up those rocks and throw them over my head.
164	181 75 167 202 177 1 178 105 213 114 164	Writing in chicken scratch isn't that easy.
164	131 198 154 139 141 210 182 118 70 66 164	I want to try to get my work into the museum one day
164	163 49 4 158 152 161 148 196 41 204 164	I'm not sure who is handing over the mic to who in this photograph but I would be happy to engage in some of my own public speaking.
164	87 201 22 192 208 77 51 188 168 15 164	One day I will set my foot on there also
164	186 175 5 14 123 176 98 17 56 204 164	I've never been to church before, but I am ready to try something new!
164	80 174 206 153 74 213 117 62 136 16 164	Let's start an outdoor food truck too!
164	101 156 209 108 177 176 3 94 31 196 164	This is a place of freedom.
164	46 102 153 151 72 203 91 43 181 215 164	What does that hand signal mean? Is it some kind of secret message from MI6?
164	175 126 162 54 214 64 17 29 166 193 164	I could wash those top windows
164	68 168 124 120 53 99 138 17 38 97 164	I'm going backpacking all by myself in places like this next year
164	18 148 87 7 93 211 139 38 116 51 164	I want to try skiing like this!
164	118 139 137 192 135 214 167 201 182 22 164	I'm booking a trip to china now
164	71 56 202 40 198 207 178 127 6 22 164	This looks like caveman art!
164	142 169 137 4 127 12 48 183 124 45 164	I'd dig right in to that. Wouldn't even need equipment.
164	13 81 68 35 62 23 206 185 98 33 164	The ship is a mere stupor
164	106 114 40 90 147 54 38 173 135 149 164	To see people from 3rd world countries compete in major sporting events is great, even sharing their own food with the crowd, I would eat it.
164	39 92 100 82 209 27 31 207 67 26 164	I think he has a good grasp on cutting this guy's finger off with minimal amount of blood.
164	56 90 21 28 168 98 149 148 138 185 164	I wish I could be as brave and curious as a new born exploring their world for the first time.
164	113 132 88 6 56 21 171 49 80 13 164	I would follow this map to find the bear and fight it
165	138 112 172 85 66 101 185 55 86 77 165	She looks like fun!
165	139 71 85 30 113 147 99 64 95 98 165	Looks like a great work out
165	91 128 197 104 44 116 160 149 3 78 165	A singer in her zone.
165	124 105 203 153 128 170 126 122 169 137 165	Did your dog splash around in there?
165	2 205 103 126 163 36 158 138 109 96 165	Smashing cake into your face is the best way to get married.
165	176 114 51 43 108 97 185 181 135 203 165	This tree is straight out of a fairytale book.
165	129 192 7 17 33 40 109 18 208 123 165	Celebrate good times, come on!
165	134 207 178 176 60 172 213 88 120 202 165	I'd like to spend the night in one of these fine fabric tents.
165	188 185 174 195 199 205 155 63 154 103 165	Sandwiches... what a treat, I'd like to eat one as a move to the beat.
165	42 39 40 7 114 132 35 46 44 29 165	awe, how sweet!
165	160 206 45 171 188 87 60 95 72 84 165	omg! I wish I could pet all of them
165	85 137 46 167 140 105 189 168 161 125 165	what a great feeling. Wind against your face.
165	161 110 89 9 82 131 44 92 99 6 165	This looks like fairy land
165	70 118 176 144 206 54 26 188 84 82 165	What a splendid evening.  I bet the fairies are out.
165	62 157 141 187 25 46 186 193 202 72 165	the stairs are playful and fun
165	63 186 42 129 206 185 134 14 103 207 165	What a fantastical bird house.
165	112 109 17 75 204 44 174 72 43 166 165	The picture is playful
165	31 152 111 116 12 172 202 198 64 140 165	delightful street corner,
165	37 178 200 106 164 81 150 68 123 184 165	Ok, boy, fetch my slippers.  No?  Ok, stare at my food again then.
165	167 70 141 116 135 1 188 148 133 114 165	This is straight out of a story book.
165	112 136 99 23 55 179 100 70 38 185 165	do not lose the camera at that speed
165	1 108 10 26 205 113 97 87 131 106 165	What a happy place a parade.
165	104 156 125 141 142 27 117 35 26 72 165	What a beautiful train! London's Invisible Express has revolutionized rail travel. The attention to detail is OUTSTANDING
165	19 121 126 187 93 88 38 49 211 62 165	Lets skip through a field full of flowers and hold hands.
165	75 1 171 113 167 125 91 112 57 38 165	He must be a mischievous guy
165	39 66 98 54 180 43 17 115 78 183 165	What an adorable baby adorned in cutesy baby accessories!
165	69 8 185 106 39 211 46 180 117 202 165	Chicken soup reminds me of Grandma's house
165	96 8 7 195 100 43 140 46 137 78 165	The city is just so beautiful.  I feel there are unlimited places I could explore.
165	77 107 55 63 59 122 131 2 158 204 165	I would love to explore this city with you!
165	104 214 213 172 58 82 26 180 156 203 165	Here puppy, come boy.
165	123 118 13 172 53 150 137 112 120 83 165	What a lovely castle, I bet the princess lives in the top room.
165	27 136 114 79 2 73 91 151 113 100 165	The flowers are playful
165	40 147 116 212 15 5 94 48 119 73 165	What a lovely display!
165	95 137 155 182 136 48 198 44 65 43 165	I wonder if he's doing this activity on a dare.
165	107 173 192 7 190 141 96 157 76 127 165	These must be winners of a competition.
165	25 188 77 174 30 85 21 4 148 64 165	The queen is hilarious
165	81 174 132 85 135 52 147 18 163 193 165	The window washers must have fun, i'd climb them!
165	172 207 75 191 183 28 130 49 137 84 165	Just let him go, he only wants a bite of the guy's hand.
165	191 90 37 79 49 9 137 30 128 93 165	Jamming on mu guitar, oh yeah!!!
165	118 207 157 190 86 110 168 101 194 71 165	I think this flower is nice.
165	53 81 23 49 154 127 108 196 83 156 165	This cute cat has the most adoringly beautiful green eyes.
165	187 83 68 123 43 118 4 50 17 9 165	Great place to place hide and seek.
165	199 114 82 34 102 70 197 212 124 32 165	I bet they have killer slopes on this mountain.
165	122 212 65 159 130 19 111 103 48 172 165	The marching band is entertaining.
165	149 146 197 153 127 9 8 26 181 97 165	What a beautiful flower in the girl's hair!
165	53 179 57 189 8 120 84 177 180 76 165	The sky is as blue as the water
165	61 145 4 194 28 48 154 62 100 63 165	The water is blue like the sky

166	153 19 175 100 24 47 112 40 120 71 166	The boy in the back does not care about what's going on
166	129 40 159 149 208 59 122 133 190 151 166	The girls look disinterested
166	24 172 115 170 4 93 41 133 135 47 166	The view makes some people disinterested in the rest of the world
166	56 30 58 196 80 194 131 157 93 39 166	The people were disinterested inthe tractor
166	170 138 59 115 105 184 63 12 1 143 166	Big deal it's a sunset
166	60 172 82 103 133 93 181 64 69 70 166	I've seen better rides there
166	193 101 180 98 154 48 182 159 149 64 166	I wouldn't even look out the window, who cares.
166	208 62 1 111 136 98 107 81 178 53 166	Old cars are so boring. Yawn.
166	70 94 215 9 170 153 32 41 81 157 166	Its an ok care I guess... if you like getting less than 10 miles per gallon
166	25 10 174 148 173 52 92 202 88 215 166	This is too cold.
166	18 190 193 1 102 12 189 30 199 174 166	really who cares?
166	165 186 33 21 93 19 76 144 77 55 166	I've seen so many waterfalls, this is nothing new.
166	9 154 43 22 69 62 72 106 188 78 166	Why is she taking selfies?
166	63 169 178 107 3 187 213 72 32 1 166	This is really uninteresting.
166	81 56 71 59 128 95 148 181 184 36 166	Good for you kids.
166	99 67 196 65 165 152 201 167 6 30 166	I care not for which team wins.
166	148 175 130 76 138 24 34 212 211 124 166	Yeah, well, that's fine for that guy I guess.
166	31 51 45 149 190 56 121 50 58 60 166	I am disinterested in indoor football
166	137 6 154 188 173 195 74 89 108 114 166	The teacher seems so unconcerned
166	58 200 120 140 186 21 165 64 127 134 166	Wood is not the best product for that. What were they thinking?
166	19 180 82 107 75 36 130 196 185 145 166	Yet another person at the party
166	195 200 109 20 206 211 48 144 70 188 166	I just dropped something down there, but who cares?
166	180 49 157 194 92 109 78 33 172 215 166	I will never understand why people take pictures from behind like this.
166	148 59 214 139 158 81 10 47 213 57 166	cute special loving
166	124 5 123 161 195 172 16 19 106 86 166	The trip to the gardens was one of the most boring things ever.  At least I got to spend time with my children.
166	145 45 138 154 77 113 108 11 71 161 166	Just some goats
166	168 40 17 56 176 107 70 64 115 74 166	It's another light fixture.
166	90 151 45 144 179 80 50 148 201 136 166	Don't much care for monuments. Seems like a waste of effort to memorialize.
166	60 34 49 95 28 10 11 183 200 69 166	Oh what a dirty cave.
166	23 85 83 134 15 37 143 101 102 208 166	I really don't care what it looks like there I'm still not coming.
166	119 104 53 159 61 139 145 132 110 17 166	The conference key note speaker was an absolute bore.
166	25 206 130 211 18 144 112 199 55 186 166	These carts won't hold much, oh well.
166	14 127 13 123 122 19 182 36 143 186 166	the child is disinterested with the stones of the ground
166	5 111 102 114 184 156 159 139 210 120 166	He will fall off that and drown, oh well.
166	75 122 34 159 116 32 153 130 87 201 166	I don't care what language that is written in.
166	56 73 116 115 120 189 177 29 71 213 166	I bet this pilot doesn't even know where they are going, if they didn't come back it wouldn't be a huge loss to the world.
166	24 204 101 66 54 151 73 123 99 207 166	I just don't see the importance of a red roof.
166	64 76 202 210 92 72 69 110 1 88 166	It looks ready to pour!
166	56 36 24 37 61 38 104 98 133 12 166	I would rather be indoors than outside.
166	70 9 110 42 167 40 154 56 95 96 166	not a safe place
166	213 178 12 131 186 70 137 27 60 148 166	This city is pretty dull.
166	52 109 182 133 156 144 121 190 212 95 166	There is food on the table
166	155 119 56 27 121 63 205 64 143 35 166	These never work, not worth my time
166	79 202 19 90 104 78 122 215 89 171 166	I guess grass needs it's picture taken too.
166	194 143 11 29 149 209 75 136 191 165 166	The people are talking
166	15 99 92 25 53 120 118 159 190 212 166	It looks red.
166	4 154 212 91 69 130 200 40 143 160 166	I don't even know what that round thing is - wait, I don't even care...
166	1 47 186 163 90 177 105 27 35 104 166	Corona and Red Bull, how interesting *yawn*.
166	185 5 124 75 132 191 32 49 48 193 166	I'd rather be chilling in my hut drinking a can of root beer than taking a trip into the sky over the hot desert.
166	61 3 213 55 117 11 19 30 82 119 166	It's only a fence, who cares what it looks like?
166	51 153 178 19 148 122 154 118 107 124 166	I'd rather see something else
166	146 8 40 175 113 13 142 27 188 137 166	I don't care about these things.
166	117 47 204 173 93 212 83 26 116 113 166	I don't even know who these people are.
166	42 141 125 68 213 197 26 50 95 66 166	This would've been cooler if someone was out there in the fountain.
166	38 182 1 15 172 125 213 159 190 117 166	I don't care what is happening here.
166	190 188 182 110 180 183 164 96 74 162 166	This statue is boring.
166	97 9 10 198 79 89 98 136 58 80 166	What a strange photo.
166	156 78 16 185 163 112 177 123 43 82 166	Surely you have better pictures.
166	51 26 194 82 56 12 141 150 59 134 166	Are these your best pictures?
166	117 86 54 60 172 181 18 89 42 35 166	my car tops out at 120 for a reason
166	34 192 125 39 181 90 79 33 110 142 166	looks like a regular old yard
166	70 116 176 56 198 80 195 141 7 119 166	Stray dogs are such a nuisance. They should all be rounded up and euthanatized.
166	120 88 142 76 205 85 79 48 64 21 166	They'll be divorced within five years, I bet.
166	142 191 30 136 53 23 63 15 171 110 166	This soldier looks like he's fairly bored.
166	160 38 193 154 179 165 71 65 104 145 166	same old scenery every day
166	124 17 63 202 55 93 149 74 29 203 166	there is nothing left
166	43 102 144 147 84 21 18 23 4 110 166	I don't care about this gloomy place
166	88 169 140 173 214 114 41 56 9 19 166	this government have to take care of it
166	56 106 93 153 27 12 129 41 145 211 166	The building does not interest me
166	105 139 39 70 192 58 141 50 136 175 166	No, you will come out tonight!
166	130 212 70 50 210 32 39 200 185 30 166	This parade is boring.
166	76 126 116 38 129 99 142 147 57 169 166	What is so great about this shot anyways?
166	197 86 202 46 12 136 94 33 208 120 166	Who cares about a stupid bridge?
166	103 148 180 162 16 193 37 173 32 170 166	This is a boring steet.
166	215 13 196 105 21 39 38 209 26 145 166	Looks so boring!
166	87 154 8 35 19 215 156 108 22 101 166	Interesting photo op. Are we not going to discuss the fact they aren't wearing shoes?
166	159 127 150 55 49 109 64 26 196 193 166	Why a blank image?
166	70 148 195 44 68 215 79 189 159 46 166	It's a picture of a gray haired youngish lady decked out all in pink.
166	104 107 45 22 124 93 154 96 150 211 166	People live by the beach is asking for troubles when hurricane comes.
166	184 174 135 147 54 187 172 204 202 130 166	Stop showing me your family photos, the last thing I care about is your last family vacation.
166	215 197 211 22 121 118 119 133 102 179 166	That's just another house that looks like all there others around the niegborhood.
166	32 160 126 163 110 199 176 103 116 207 166	I'm too busy checking my email to look at the view.
166	49 81 105 20 144 148 41 200 198 107 166	I really don't understand why people would pay for string concerts when you can get the same thing in better quality cheaper online.
166	2 164 90 169 25 188 117 92 183 99 166	Thought the building was cool at first, but imagine if this scene was how nature left it
166	68 39 38 9 91 129 122 155 2 45 166	My husband and I had sushi tonight!
166	173 90 121 147 127 175 117 187 196 197 166	Jeez how boring is this? Who really wants to see someone play on the drums with no shirt?
166	81 82 174 100 212 186 158 1 170 147 166	Some new duds would be nice.
166	193 9 153 15 158 72 159 143 197 124 166	I don't care if I ever see the Eiffel tower.
166	65 50 156 137 195 116 30 61 86 2 166	I don;t care if they get enough to eat.
166	107 214 77 70 9 8 66 26 120 142 166	Looks like he's about to be impaled by an icicle.
166	209 85 51 102 20 47 78 44 142 174 166	I don't even care what this photo is about.
166	72 191 3 30 14 193 213 136 73 158 166	Eh, this picture looks very posed
166	93 11 192 76 124 6 103 22 183 9 166	Not anything that I haven't seen before.
166	188 162 95 161 78 35 163 12 62 142 166	brother and sister times
166	100 170 48 111 150 72 177 142 41 96 166	Oh look it's some old house somewhere boring.
166	201 189 47 132 209 16 128 57 89 207 166	This performance is boring.
166	61 112 78 62 207 130 124 139 191 110 166	This sure is a picture.
166	202 127 21 50 4 106 48 131 172 109 166	The sky and my mood can obviously relate to one another.
166	5 194 206 100 90 195 6 148 160 79 166	This is so stupid and annoying
166	162 138 27 154 117 11 70 178 64 68 166	What an ugly bird
166	90 180 38 114 104 41 102 162 205 28 166	Some old architecture, not interesting
166	214 93 54 20 188 165 82 133 65 137 166	Who cares about a dog running? All dogs do that.
166	22 16 96 19 90 21 84 68 15 124 166	These flowers are boring.
166	107 97 26 146 34 53 208 17 22 129 166	Keep staring kitty cat.
166	82 4 206 80 133 56 211 194 196 203 166	This view is boring.
166	203 46 106 122 50 206 149 54 32 199 166	That kid looks like she needs to go to the dentist.
166	98 59 204 194 57 104 71 197 99 215 166	Owning a guitar doesn't make you a musician
166	153 144 9 40 106 57 103 29 121 142 166	It's just a car, who cares.
166	76 82 159 60 154 195 198 185 137 178 166	Seriously? It's mist, not a tornado.
166	173 112 39 67 81 167 135 194 186 117 166	What a waste of time, that statue is dime a dozen
166	53 172 190 93 90 86 128 9 78 183 166	Chima Simone is missing, but who cares.
166	142 109 169 50 141 156 37 157 173 158 166	Yay, another monument.
166	198 3 180 77 164 88 55 209 172 194 166	Boring! Get some real toys in here!
166	135 143 64 62 183 110 63 209 167 113 166	This band is boring.
166	122 168 145 215 121 158 183 10 19 73 166	this looks stupid
166	10 97 135 106 98 37 141 170 35 171 166	This car should be scraped.
166	59 3 64 163 214 91 61 202 17 66 166	I guess this looks like a cool place
166	98 67 48 206 203 162 95 213 101 183 166	It is very crucial for us to honor those who passed
166	164 183 54 129 188 116 191 211 182 83 166	This dam looks like it may need to be fixed, but it is still working at this time. Leave it be.
166	189 1 139 50 97 14 19 180 13 91 166	Nice view but i have seen better.
166	81 139 109 134 129 92 19 190 70 112 166	I think he has a ugly face
166	131 193 196 53 19 144 50 167 132 47 166	What a boring hillside.
166	125 54 209 183 7 121 176 196 115 186 166	Who does he think he is staring me down like that.
166	140 18 39 175 184 57 157 153 86 156 166	Can that bear be more in the way? I could care less about art.
166	7 117 203 147 156 94 69 51 2 197 166	it's a hat.
166	34 5 72 177 52 31 157 200 18 119 166	Should of kept the camera still more.
166	23 134 37 57 58 54 95 84 125 33 166	Those aren't that nice looking.
166	148 111 105 4 135 205 195 107 55 30 166	Yay, people running in circles..
166	142 23 214 26 180 211 206 151 19 195 166	Oh a bridge sign who cares?
166	160 138 19 192 159 71 92 208 72 184 166	Who cares what the foundation is about they're just greedy.
166	110 42 71 139 159 4 99 131 111 15 166	Too blurry to care
166	138 1 195 80 115 8 17 67 101 210 166	There is nothing special to see here.
166	76 32 143 149 83 202 28 33 41 70 166	This isn't that cool. Happens all the time.
166	89 125 130 136 162 106 145 14 184 51 166	Why is he even up there? I don't care about what he's saying.
166	142 1 177 204 168 167 188 211 105 62 166	She doesn't look that happy
166	121 91 71 16 118 36 113 168 162 109 166	Just another sunset on an ordinary day in some far away land.
166	123 35 124 205 111 212 146 65 145 85 166	Honey let's go...you've looked at that concrete long enough
166	43 91 215 73 125 208 118 110 126 2 166	I don't care
166	77 177 59 17 214 27 188 126 65 92 166	Parties like this are so meaningless.
166	101 17 92 192 98 142 4 73 209 59 166	Fish are not interesting at all.
166	9 39 40 141 1 171 136 83 155 18 166	The staircase and the elevator are just okay.
166	157 201 53 36 29 178 203 107 191 62 166	This looks lame
166	137 130 197 79 31 43 188 199 145 93 166	I suppose this is a nice view.
166	55 61 141 157 137 58 25 68 147 160 166	Yet another stink assed pier
166	90 46 134 130 138 102 66 63 80 49 166	i am disinterested  to eat this food
166	189 157 21 88 87 7 90 180 79 74 166	they are interested to eat the food
166	44 207 191 185 200 192 93 87 98 11 166	What is there to see here? Just boring old mountains.
166	193 53 64 4 191 197 76 95 152 66 166	Let us cut down all of these trees and make paper.
166	181 154 129 114 121 182 135 22 94 191 166	She seems very indifferent
166	117 212 146 163 89 45 64 144 149 142 166	Who cares about the building
166	138 63 193 126 137 196 204 127 83 43 166	It's just another flower like any other.
166	164 2 201 46 96 80 72 42 69 10 166	Yeah, it's just graffiti, who cares, it's everywhere anyway.
166	9 147 112 45 101 118 144 159 26 131 166	what a load of uninteresting brick work
166	71 40 60 129 37 10 202 128 182 86 166	This building is less than exciting.
166	146 211 206 133 184 57 22 122 155 136 166	This does not look like a place I want to live.
166	188 47 123 40 144 108 3 46 176 126 166	So, there is no one on the beach and , who cares.
166	83 202 213 193 72 22 177 15 158 34 166	He should not smile
166	175 56 51 145 26 35 152 181 126 47 166	Why would anyone want to look at this
166	178 108 22 34 28 114 4 63 61 118 166	The graphics of this image are not worth looking at.
166	60 110 197 104 44 153 47 22 85 43 166	Who cares if that dog can jump, all dogs can jump.
166	137 196 215 107 73 96 62 204 31 155 166	Girls looks to have good time. I can not say the same for the old man.
166	214 151 203 200 25 108 56 52 72 54 166	I really wish all of these trees would get burned dow3n
166	37 173 172 87 122 15 123 210 133 13 166	It's the same crappy band that's always here. I wish they'd find some other haunt to shriek in.
166	79 73 28 209 104 123 162 159 81 99 166	Let's the weeds grow, see if I care.
166	75 95 137 31 164 28 4 9 63 179 166	what are those packets .. anyways they dont seem appealing
166	34 4 86 194 174 2 53 147 3 131 166	whats the point of that dumb sign
166	96 133 127 87 108 120 83 86 175 124 166	I am not going to refill that.
166	78 103 171 211 156 81 79 93 42 197 166	They look like they're about to crash into each other. Cool.
166	158 118 135 49 146 32 190 183 142 215 166	These chefs are preparing a grand meal but is presentation really that important.
166	60 9 108 56 10 28 36 23 152 175 166	The painting is okay. It's not anything special to be honest.
166	89 31 24 64 155 190 150 198 122 76 166	No point in taking pics of gates and bars
166	8 69 206 194 42 120 94 12 121 135 166	Wonder who's the idiot that drew this picture.
166	194 197 134 35 16 73 169 82 49 148 166	Who cares that their married. Everyone gets married.
166	51 118 136 132 194 169 43 156 73 209 166	Is this supposed to be art?
166	107 124 80 99 17 152 87 162 178 200 166	Grass is ugly.
166	43 29 193 201 95 198 207 118 134 23 166	What is that photo? Its a blur.
166	91 125 165 55 173 207 155 64 205 9 166	Seen one river you've seen them all
166	172 11 1 143 188 138 203 77 40 157 166	I've been there. So what?
166	50 140 73 175 114 67 183 195 7 160 166	I supposed this statue speaks to something important that happened a long time ago in our history.  To be honest though, I couldn't care less!
166	49 83 202 162 163 191 64 168 154 152 166	What could possibly be more dull this this picture? I don't think there is anything else.
166	36 70 161 38 154 157 177 200 1 80 166	It`s show green
166	104 142 8 101 199 36 87 100 136 135 166	Oh gawd, another cute kid that's my baby photo. WHO CARES?
166	138 212 67 45 153 198 214 94 178 170 166	red mountains and less grass, time for some wild west horse riding
166	175 177 215 149 199 75 32 132 124 38 166	Yay, another pic with gorgeous women having fun. yawn...
166	146 139 144 80 164 105 202 10 159 194 166	Yeah, people camp, so what?
166	16 118 52 43 158 134 86 193 173 25 166	This photo is just boring
166	155 85 79 162 80 13 148 2 190 31 166	My brain is drying up by just standing here.
166	164 59 77 148 44 150 170 103 109 98 166	Nothing of interest here
166	115 72 90 138 112 79 24 61 201 36 166	What do you have in a bottle?
166	163 90 141 56 121 175 157 12 169 182 166	Where is the next room
167	141 196 194 164 97 183 18 209 106 98 167	These people are clearly discussing me.
167	190 16 202 112 138 21 182 22 65 14 167	They are laughing at my joke.
167	52 172 186 50 110 62 151 161 191 100 167	I should be in this picture.  After all, I am much prettier than they are.
167	129 86 171 33 143 180 45 125 57 192 167	I'm more attractive than any of these girls.
167	191 29 97 61 119 47 17 13 115 10 167	I am so smart, I don't need any friends who can't see that I am a genius.
167	42 7 145 78 18 163 14 26 140 66 167	this dish is definitely not up to my standards
167	94 193 159 214 50 164 132 91 168 162 167	An all consuming scenery
167	181 79 195 179 61 101 35 67 168 144 167	Nice place to hike, it looks
167	13 40 148 191 93 132 68 133 32 67 167	They're standing right in front of the table I was trying to get to. They are such a waste of space.
167	195 105 37 107 132 139 166 211 42 156 167	that horse isn't as lonely as I am
167	52 15 53 126 184 133 208 180 82 31 167	I've been here before! I can tell you all about my experience.
167	13 51 151 159 188 111 30 189 23 50 167	I look better than this in shinguards.
167	184 165 180 185 106 144 112 10 146 119 167	This is my favorite color!
167	148 139 34 21 29 67 129 169 86 83 167	My car is faster than the blue car.
167	145 158 65 77 2 172 125 157 108 195 167	I've been in much better places than this one.
167	5 78 148 202 56 9 147 66 190 208 167	This map is too hard for me to read.
167	10 30 107 205 48 166 57 133 162 147 167	I should own a building like this, I deserve it.
167	147 39 94 138 65 80 211 141 32 45 167	I'd like to be a character people play at conventions. I think I'm renowned enough.
167	81 210 108 11 170 76 149 12 120 1 167	You have to have two of everything all in different colors and sizes.
167	150 188 71 7 208 90 204 131 13 93 167	Those people aren't as good as me
167	94 150 200 77 15 124 175 51 204 129 167	My graphs are much better
167	85 72 194 66 102 147 26 28 201 88 167	I won't let my friend know, but I found a rare species of bird in my yard. He will be so jealous!
167	142 170 179 71 111 178 49 73 149 137 167	These bike racks seriously take up the BEST parking space. I guess I'll have to walk an extra 20 feet #notfeelingit
167	73 212 52 152 131 21 184 19 89 178 167	This reminds me of my home in vegas, It's a very nice home I have.
167	200 3 122 208 99 179 204 52 58 42 167	This guy reminds me of myself from the 80's.
167	204 20 14 155 131 108 149 208 176 76 167	This is where I should be married and they should keep my funeral.
167	5 82 173 16 2 146 192 171 45 186 167	Wish no one could see this mountain but me
167	158 56 111 118 191 41 74 110 46 180 167	I like to hit these things at full speed.
167	73 150 173 76 91 41 103 19 138 1 167	See that right there? Belongs to me , because I am amazing. I just love that I deserve and get such awesome things.
167	60 36 117 67 107 202 45 184 170 51 167	You all should be jealous that this is my view from my home, that I took with my amazing camera. Yup!
167	203 44 181 16 31 102 71 101 22 81 167	That picture would look better with me in it.
167	161 32 155 162 203 103 52 31 213 47 167	I could work at that place
167	198 40 164 28 161 2 5 56 213 180 167	This building is pretty self-centered...get it? haha
167	67 37 32 206 93 100 138 124 168 162 167	I wish my parents would have gotten me a teddy bear like that one.
167	87 69 98 161 19 149 4 51 46 150 167	You are your own god
167	68 44 13 159 3 52 93 34 98 89 167	The mans shirt is dull
167	48 31 193 214 129 83 90 91 215 205 167	Wow, his form is all wrong, I'm sure I could pick out all of the mistakes in this picture.
167	152 108 171 125 46 184 48 126 121 62 167	It's fine to listen to other opinions, but they need to listen to those of us with concerns.
167	41 118 119 81 201 178 74 175 158 211 167	Yeah, they sound good, I guess, but they ignored my request for "Freebird," so I am going to yell "boo!" and throw stuff at them.
167	176 33 90 206 9 169 112 134 178 60 167	I would totally deserve this beautiful view.
167	74 79 117 160 104 52 39 196 1 49 167	Wish somebody looked at me like that.
167	208 183 17 214 37 54 124 101 48 57 167	I really don't have time to hear this.
167	126 125 27 23 42 119 107 123 15 59 167	Thats me in the middle, number 1
167	168 99 148 195 174 157 107 166 185 47 167	Why would I be interested in this random picture?
167	81 107 213 197 9 3 53 77 202 78 167	I knew I could scare her.
167	144 21 192 150 133 72 214 101 89 147 167	This parade is making walking though the street very difficult for me
167	119 135 137 3 138 62 91 155 20 15 167	Ugh we must get rid of this photo!  My hair just looks awful.
167	47 109 57 17 192 190 3 199 65 28 167	I only care about three people: me, myself, and I.
167	107 10 105 45 66 181 175 42 12 9 167	This building was name after me
167	196 83 165 145 13 189 215 105 12 45 167	The trees in this photo are as beautiful as I am!
167	183 46 94 79 82 187 127 147 70 50 167	My graffiti is so much better than anyone else's.
167	120 127 161 199 135 113 80 4 53 84 167	Books,  I dont need to read, I already know almost everything.
167	54 76 113 77 196 176 26 90 213 149 167	I would not have chosen that bike to ride around town, It is not comfortable.
167	205 118 47 56 145 113 105 51 60 194 167	i'm a better player than that guy
167	161 44 201 34 65 40 77 14 158 138 167	i dont like the lights on this picture, i would do it better!
167	58 176 76 89 193 198 211 73 153 39 167	I am too special to think this yard is nice.
167	18 101 213 103 207 196 140 185 171 173 167	Would be nice if we could actually read the writing instead of this tiny picture
167	102 95 82 44 83 170 176 147 70 90 167	Much like this bird I spread my wings and soar above everyone else
167	14 152 180 132 8 82 135 212 179 157 167	I have no regrets.
167	110 50 200 26 115 127 107 51 160 102 167	I am a better baseball player than these guys.
167	172 5 105 163 124 46 211 96 128 85 167	That dog better not chew my furniture
167	208 54 120 162 148 8 145 209 200 207 167	They must all be looking at me.
167	108 165 130 29 7 140 9 95 114 118 167	I am the best pitcher of all time.
167	40 6 114 75 7 160 166 78 142 25 167	This is a car for a loser.
167	141 163 108 97 196 51 205 87 5 129 167	I could take that crab, I wouldn't let him get the drop on me.
167	129 41 35 175 86 127 2 191 196 148 167	The people at the table are all looking directly at me.
167	26 23 97 128 102 92 98 38 65 89 167	I would be able to cook so well and i am sure my cooking ware would make a nice photo!
167	73 99 200 39 166 1 12 42 53 120 167	This guy doesn't look very prepared or confident. I could do a better job.
167	19 7 71 175 149 162 209 47 50 194 167	I don't care if this guy just won a gold medal, I'm better than him.
167	120 50 151 157 100 37 154 143 176 62 167	This is just a bunch of rocks smashed together, I could make better "art".
167	151 94 123 147 14 84 39 43 56 81 167	I would eat that, but I'm trying to lose weight.
167	208 41 156 66 195 70 111 200 100 198 167	I look better holding a camera
167	95 58 90 11 185 197 65 35 110 126 167	I would be the best dancer in this picture.
167	42 62 162 5 135 152 205 6 150 177 167	These buses are ugly and I would not be caught dead on one.
167	200 124 62 183 142 59 3 31 117 190 167	This picture would be so much cooler if I were on the trail riding my bike.
167	64 11 214 132 104 126 10 44 183 42 167	Don't really get the point of this pic, I could do better
167	171 128 11 205 102 194 169 97 193 91 167	My pictures look way better than this one, so boring!
167	133 97 149 135 128 144 160 168 73 214 167	Who would walk out of the house with these shoes? Everyone should be wearing expensive shoes like I do.
167	139 147 155 178 38 85 32 40 28 58 167	I am like this rock- strong and forthright.
167	8 44 82 58 197 189 70 111 66 59 167	I don't think i could live like this, it is too beige for me
167	184 134 214 4 81 142 41 160 75 180 167	This is a vacation I need to go on!
167	166 64 83 123 124 150 56 67 121 100 167	If you want to look as good as me, take one pill twice a day.
167	180 94 24 53 71 84 130 13 207 146 167	I'm better at sports
167	72 36 208 96 107 162 203 79 1 176 167	i could have cut up this mulch better
167	194 133 10 140 204 211 199 62 5 4 167	This guy needs to sit down and let me take over.
167	100 194 39 138 66 27 178 211 185 212 167	I could make this place look better than this.
167	169 12 168 91 11 20 100 16 185 190 167	the statue is bad, i would do it better
167	176 201 139 79 215 34 23 107 70 116 167	Hopefully this picture of my meal will make me look sophisticated!
167	30 2 93 207 192 52 126 86 118 85 167	These fish are not as special as me.
167	81 183 192 104 207 195 2 36 113 124 167	I saw a place like this once, but it was much more beautiful.
167	34 117 105 143 86 10 36 180 172 129 167	My arms are bigger.
167	1 86 40 19 23 144 25 96 126 80 167	I am the center of the universe.
167	207 108 154 18 164 68 124 87 63 7 167	I am better looking than this statue!
167	116 137 108 172 103 96 122 29 138 121 167	To make a poster like this is so full of ego!
167	97 9 208 163 134 148 128 169 135 51 167	I like the snow. I like winter
167	2 123 214 39 146 93 104 99 130 120 167	This is almost as beautiful as my face
167	171 201 81 156 194 10 14 142 51 205 167	Almost as beautiful as me!
167	89 162 91 107 140 120 127 46 214 159 167	He gets a lot of attention like that, but I could get more.
167	143 130 94 119 138 89 31 116 65 113 167	Surely I can park here for just a minute.
167	29 62 213 190 184 156 146 145 109 89 167	I wish i was holding that baby
167	212 114 24 214 3 31 155 163 137 164 167	I once had to clean a bunch of graffiti.
167	162 176 39 29 130 46 194 56 96 107 167	I'd take the best selfie there.
167	188 204 11 85 162 40 156 20 130 164 167	My tree is better decorated by me every Christmas.
167	1 40 212 116 84 141 29 105 129 20 167	I want all those flowers for myself
167	127 60 168 175 205 160 93 113 188 64 167	Ah, my crowns.  They finally got me the two different models I requested.
167	9 16 139 143 208 106 128 4 81 190 167	The only thing that matters is the sky and me.
167	68 104 60 157 139 165 128 163 197 201 167	My costumes are MUCH better than that one.
167	83 183 157 29 56 107 160 64 140 73 167	I feel so kitty kitty, I don't care if you are watching me
167	190 99 67 48 46 153 151 108 138 91 167	Thank god I haven't lost that much hair yet.
167	145 62 187 100 32 59 63 173 94 148 167	No tourist allowed
167	81 75 119 154 85 93 179 12 138 5 167	Someone needs to touch that up!
167	22 168 187 153 159 62 46 191 101 72 167	This land should belong to me.  It was stolen right of my hands.
167	147 152 100 139 113 125 87 110 67 96 167	He wouldn't stop making noise so it looks like hes just going to have to stay in there for a while.
167	193 121 16 25 23 61 109 28 107 149 167	This castle will be mine one day even if I have to take it from their paws.
167	188 103 198 146 127 148 180 21 10 90 167	I think that kind of looks like me.  He might have been trying to paint me.
167	67 189 115 93 123 165 107 109 152 88 167	I know my gaming parties had a much better supply of Mountain Dew,
167	52 109 84 30 170 69 49 65 205 124 167	I bet that scarf would look so much better on me.
167	39 99 42 83 86 72 145 44 58 193 167	I could rock the stage more than these fools.
167	55 50 39 164 31 67 69 157 131 209 167	Pretty sure I could play better then he does
167	4 126 151 185 33 21 1 157 79 48 167	The diamonds in this pendant seems to be cheaply made.
167	189 14 198 144 129 132 209 122 106 130 167	These people are all ugly compared to me
167	176 40 73 113 67 124 41 132 43 171 167	I want to win that bear to have all to myself.
167	16 165 121 194 54 64 168 118 152 3 167	This guy is so much uglier than me
167	101 81 104 21 181 68 59 148 213 171 167	I would never put something so ugly like that up in a community.
167	87 121 142 107 67 170 120 89 51 177 167	The success of his project depends on me.
167	109 62 106 119 93 164 195 129 47 211 167	I bet they're all waiting for me to arrive before they leave.
167	118 27 176 187 57 164 113 145 171 203 167	Maybe you should learn how to use a camera before you take a picture like that.
167	47 2 118 61 209 139 168 96 150 110 167	This is my spot
167	201 63 121 69 149 153 81 188 214 171 167	I am so more important than her.
167	148 65 32 79 118 151 21 168 42 195 167	I want to be there! I would jump in and I would have more fun than he is
167	105 125 215 186 175 11 137 138 71 204 167	Ha! No way he catches the dot, it's impossible! He'll keep running after it for my enjoyment.
167	205 215 110 6 77 113 25 172 161 55 167	That architecture is pretty nice, but it really doesn't compare to some of my work.
167	91 69 19 81 159 163 68 18 50 161 167	She looks pretty good in that outfit, but I think I'd wear it better.
167	74 43 77 162 177 28 96 64 7 27 167	No way am I shoveling out there
167	72 141 28 10 145 173 6 3 16 125 167	The ladder in the picture vain.
167	82 144 153 149 155 120 156 1 89 124 167	Why is that paper blank? You should be working harder than that, you should look at my note pages for my AP classes!
167	84 77 23 64 136 140 69 86 120 121 167	we are happy to see him because in this make self respect
167	13 72 116 138 190 191 94 108 47 197 167	This man could go faster if he tried.
167	2 79 55 145 100 195 197 19 148 192 167	This reminds me of a time I was asked to lead to a fundraiser. I raised more money than anyone ever has.
167	42 52 107 121 102 25 168 161 36 135 167	My abandoned manufacturing facility is much better than this one.
167	52 5 96 9 143 55 14 161 27 91 167	I know more about driving horses and burros than anyone else.
167	170 205 10 103 86 12 203 87 43 152 167	Our team will slaughter them.
167	166 108 147 99 30 206 40 39 177 105 167	Why do these guys get to be in that beautiful place. I deserve to be there more.
167	100 177 131 124 37 12 50 178 164 95 167	People come here for the beauty, so I come here to let them look at me.
167	77 73 69 15 13 163 9 67 43 105 167	I can sing better than him.
167	139 205 72 33 208 13 176 62 116 67 167	This lamp is beautiful but the lamps in my house are all twice as nice!
167	11 36 148 188 81 180 90 111 47 169 167	I bet she just wants to smack her sister!
167	142 64 29 3 161 156 89 177 68 132 167	There are too many boats here!
167	142 75 103 29 9 74 59 4 20 115 167	Photo would be cuter with me in it.
167	47 36 64 51 116 199 104 193 202 4 167	I can paint better than this.
167	209 145 45 87 197 35 5 88 189 186 167	I want this in my house.
167	81 159 91 14 85 33 165 6 110 13 167	Very safe place
167	49 185 161 190 50 10 187 52 22 130 167	This festival celebrates me and only me!
167	129 165 33 60 64 119 83 155 107 29 167	I did that last year.
167	121 195 20 189 21 90 171 27 106 72 167	My top is way cuter than hers.
167	49 189 153 210 63 154 107 169 61 163 167	I want a hot air balloon
167	70 115 22 51 76 166 123 120 131 46 167	im only allowed to wear red
167	171 3 180 40 133 57 54 11 159 68 167	The lime green makes me think about myself.
167	18 47 204 21 24 169 42 181 158 96 167	An equisite piece of art. It reminds me of a piece I made, which was definitely better, of course.
167	70 108 148 46 155 196 55 130 16 182 167	This green color reminds me of being sick.
167	78 160 116 21 108 88 32 33 142 66 167	Winding roads are just like my life.  full of ups and downs and twists and turns.
167	207 173 191 55 165 18 150 198 11 57 167	Of course they never focus on me. I'm always in the background...
167	35 117 108 80 162 81 86 112 196 110 167	I would have just taken a selfie.  It would have been a better photo
167	37 179 88 100 81 84 75 23 87 48 167	This presentation would be better if it was showing a photo of me.
167	39 51 62 164 3 43 132 71 11 184 167	Shouldn't all those lines in the sky be pointing to me?
167	30 120 214 193 22 75 39 31 62 147 167	I should be in this shot.
167	159 72 187 208 104 41 123 24 16 189 167	My designs are more interesting
167	153 79 87 112 197 202 80 63 60 106 167	The elephant is a magnificent beast, just like me.
167	32 2 178 86 207 199 27 141 97 115 167	My yard is so much nicer than this
167	137 126 62 56 89 11 88 38 127 161 167	I need this garden at my house. I deserve a garden.
167	8 73 146 186 25 91 120 47 123 129 167	Why do I care about Michael Gove?
167	199 55 153 192 205 66 194 158 142 125 167	I would never allow such an ugly decoration in my home
167	196 89 63 11 139 205 50 101 95 164 167	Why would she hold that bottle vertically. It is very ineffective and lazy way of pouring
167	191 13 137 194 75 58 88 151 158 188 167	Its a X men box
167	122 152 131 146 168 27 211 123 147 145 167	Who wants to look at another person drinking from a cup, I think I could do a more interesting photo of myself.
167	103 4 9 77 182 199 24 124 53 206 167	very happy place
167	33 66 107 19 30 108 183 177 199 12 167	If I had designed this door I would have done am much better job because I am better than everyone at everything.
167	108 196 112 179 170 178 103 94 137 135 167	What can NEC do for me?
167	180 162 37 134 105 11 68 63 155 186 167	You all are as flies
167	88 125 137 130 85 110 211 196 44 103 167	He knows what's going on here. He's got it together more than anyone else. He's top dawg.
167	152 45 136 199 104 19 139 87 116 40 167	I could make something similar
167	47 80 66 197 199 161 1 91 182 9 167	I can definitely paint better than this.
167	98 68 117 134 132 206 16 110 173 201 167	me and my mama, two of a kind
167	196 45 156 91 76 204 2 154 202 20 167	You'd think he'd be able to make this presentation a little better and not so weak.
167	192 131 148 124 43 41 82 31 126 24 167	Royal blue has always been my favorite color.  They say geniuses like royal blue.
167	121 32 198 159 37 185 104 156 17 209 167	I'm better looking than this flower.
167	119 30 171 141 70 203 91 102 46 83 167	I could do a mouch better posture, after all I've practiced so much more.
167	32 69 127 164 132 88 213 178 48 68 167	Do you even lift, bro?
167	48 155 115 123 49 38 139 128 159 5 167	I can afford to buy that entire street.
168	137 132 144 190 34 66 182 175 184 75 168	Well, isn't this a lovely little setup. It looks exceptionally quaint.
168	34 95 118 152 12 144 74 80 147 177 168	Unfortunately, the melted ice cream is ruining the intrinsic design of the waffle cone pattern.
168	32 133 89 25 173 199 179 150 3 117 168	This little one deserves a great reward.
168	123 60 157 207 64 25 126 195 187 32 168	This is a picture of park during a cold winter day.
168	51 66 176 99 211 31 117 107 47 20 168	The Flamenco is truly one of the most beautiful mediums to express one's passion and lust for life
168	23 89 132 167 187 1 157 19 118 88 168	Sun shining through the clouds is the light of life.
168	7 158 64 183 28 111 149 57 187 74 168	What an interesting photo. Well done.
168	105 83 31 39 74 72 192 184 110 140 168	Some used to believe that pictures would steal your soul. What an archaic thought.
168	35 179 155 18 117 91 121 139 41 88 168	This delightful young baby looks to be so contemplative in his small and comfy chair. One must wonder what kind of thoughts he is having about the world around him at this young age.
168	205 206 81 70 122 105 86 207 196 191 168	Fluid yet quirky artwork
168	17 199 158 160 46 106 171 10 145 214 168	Looks like sports season is over.

168	185 154 103 113 196 215 97 57 161 138 168	What an unforgettable moment for you two. I hope you found the coral to be as beautiful as I remember.
168	3 167 65 128 45 78 70 38 180 121 168	It is so hot out right now! I'm melting
168	144 108 154 190 67 207 126 22 202 27 168	These young ladies seem to be having an absolute smash of a time!
168	1 39 181 137 191 98 13 32 100 63 168	The composition of this photo is truly inspiring.
168	82 14 46 129 205 138 57 65 75 132 168	This dog has quite the acute sense of hearing.
168	128 32 84 33 65 21 38 170 25 167 168	He looks like he had a good day of hard work.
168	119 105 140 116 37 79 50 61 182 138 168	this building really seems like it was built well.
168	151 202 38 23 61 191 140 49 90 155 168	The exquisite coloring in the blue that is used here along with the distinct and expressive lines goes perfectly against the snow white background.

168	136 58 152 135 187 59 124 138 56 50 168	The crimson flames burned and popped till the logs gave in to the power of the torch.
168	97 12 125 61 198 54 178 95 189 107 168	What a beautiful portrait displaying the contrasting colors of the night sky. The focus gives me a sense of peace and calm.
168	180 136 195 115 2 46 55 117 154 176 168	This is one of the coolest tribe books ever made.
168	48 135 124 210 118 70 186 201 67 213 168	This is so peaceful and calm; like poetic imagery.

168	82 86 23 38 120 139 187 62 179 188 168	What a worthy cause.

168	167 164 57 129 15 133 40 187 123 200 168	In Daoism they believe that water is the ultimate strength in the universe as it moves around and through whatever is in its path
168	64 157 123 164 198 199 158 17 47 39 168	This athlete has excellent form, and is probably a wonderful example for younger track stars to follow.
168	69 22 184 171 128 181 204 103 177 106 168	I've always felt that bumble bees represent mankind in that we all search for a beautiful flower's pollen which we can spread.

168	126 181 191 124 39 29 100 54 60 47 168	A deep mourning is expressed on the face
168	171 159 107 190 73 78 186 5 40 125 168	This statue is a beautiful shade and texture.
168	22 69 161 128 146 7 170 61 123 32 168	Everyone is dressed well
168	126 188 62 24 54 104 196 178 5 203 168	What a gorgeous breed sitting amongst the disparaged neighborhood.
168	180 53 119 110 46 33 210 86 149 150 168	The architecture from this period is jaw dropping.
168	180 117 59 165 106 37 193 194 1 174 168	Those condiments have been laid out very nicely on that plate.
168	172 9 188 190 175 203 187 162 191 105 168	What a fascinating manner of reflection.

169	184 191 61 41 56 96 27 150 92 128 169	Why is he wearing that white robe?!
169	63 131 32 72 49 8 171 30 106 61 169	This is the scene when there are four people from a political party against only one person of the opposing political party.
169	134 200 36 128 213 75 143 162 8 208 169	What a long drive.
169	206 46 137 144 82 193 40 16 13 187 169	I can't watch. She's gonna drop the ball on her feet. I can feel it.
169	66 189 89 190 84 23 150 174 77 156 169	That is way too clausterphobic.
169	57 183 117 30 181 15 150 139 7 21 169	I hate large groups of people.
169	78 88 206 13 79 100 33 34 172 19 169	This is just too messy.
169	29 156 192 132 195 41 63 52 208 185 169	As the sun pierced the market, he tensed. He could tell the Outsider was near. But how near? Then he felt it....HE was the Outsider.
169	2 56 113 8 118 172 211 170 201 116 169	That guy really should be wearing some protective gear on himself, that's a dangerous sport.
169	97 107 199 153 189 192 183 18 184 105 169	Make sure not to get hit by a car while crossing.
169	105 93 102 133 165 149 16 48 186 26 169	The man in the background is making a fool of himself.
169	149 95 123 184 168 140 11 7 121 3 169	Straight backs and awkward shoulders, do these two even like each other?
169	96 159 194 36 177 180 173 175 143 135 169	When you hear the bomb detonate it's scary. When you SEE it, it's terrifying. The way the air pressure changed, the flip of the plane. The worry and the wonder.

169	22 211 37 115 38 11 32 210 111 124 169	this looks terrible
169	129 186 42 95 16 54 74 92 111 80 169	The race is so close but I just know that 362 has what it takes to win! Come on!!!
169	48 94 123 158 161 62 84 52 146 24 169	Something isn't quite right.
169	199 205 211 187 190 156 31 32 44 34 169	Wow this is actually kinda creeping me out
169	173 31 127 28 170 85 89 52 21 38 169	I wouldn't want to be caught dead at that meeting.
169	14 19 147 148 198 166 34 47 134 46 169	Never going to make it to work on time!
169	152 161 67 130 75 174 111 133 124 16 169	It looks very harsh on the rocks
169	65 201 207 98 139 195 109 103 144 55 169	He needs to eat, and soon.
169	8 195 141 108 35 144 92 40 23 48 169	I really hope I don't fall off of this balcony right now.
169	152 51 104 176 161 37 58 93 31 86 169	Oh man, if he doesn't break that tackle and score, my house is going to be confiscated by my loan shark!
169	155 149 199 176 14 59 2 122 45 200 169	I can't help but feel trapped by this image.
169	165 52 212 163 114 204 10 85 48 116 169	This is dangerous, many evil bugs lurk under leaves.
169	76 205 66 156 175 59 176 55 1 165 169	I hope that the cat isn't captured.
169	21 2 52 64 101 96 80 78 210 203 169	I told her to close the widow
169	2 76 98 113 112 104 44 31 88 87 169	What a relief to finally get that.
169	53 173 167 113 57 68 56 66 141 139 169	Im afraid they are going to drop and break it.
169	67 215 110 128 158 82 206 11 55 199 169	shaking camera as if in danger
169	190 48 181 148 25 80 109 154 210 16 169	Those buildings are dull
169	35 116 108 104 212 176 28 36 150 190 169	It does not look like anyone has cleaned the roads, I am nervous to drive today.
169	140 40 162 53 26 134 51 138 82 100 169	The boat looks like its broken
169	143 128 127 25 86 35 67 115 31 72 169	I'm just waiting for one of those glasses to get spilt...
169	37 163 208 166 114 25 183 118 94 90 169	His gear stick is extremely sideways. I'm worried about the safety of the vehicle
169	3 50 158 194 45 117 5 155 179 38 169	Must read every word.
169	51 130 70 99 195 77 91 133 97 187 169	The hunt for the local urban legend continued as the sun fell.
169	168 66 21 205 38 51 11 172 203 43 169	Family gatherings make me want to drink too.
169	104 45 147 69 209 2 100 102 133 196 169	It makes me nervous to see all those soldiers.  Are they going to invade us?
169	114 129 59 102 76 165 123 52 63 12 169	Live music is too loud and makes me uncomfortable.
169	20 164 175 195 79 188 2 36 76 186 169	The amount of work that went into this glass makes me anxious.
169	159 27 102 26 175 144 11 164 72 158 169	Look at the desserts. They look fine.
169	91 137 43 197 124 189 155 148 88 68 169	This countryside is making me anxious.
169	137 92 199 27 200 139 76 9 156 68 169	That's too many flags in one hand for my liking
169	83 117 64 163 176 157 181 131 42 175 169	I hope nobody falls off the stage.  I am very worried
169	36 37 213 112 133 195 185 26 140 18 169	This view of the bridge is making me anxious.
169	51 79 115 84 38 207 107 88 44 129 169	I. Can't. Stand. This!!
169	144 187 8 42 71 146 138 77 195 36 169	That awkward moment when you have to fart but you're on stage.
169	167 24 21 190 145 134 178 68 111 144 169	I'm not sure I can make it with my bicycle down that hill.
169	187 127 166 5 89 79 18 83 181 150 169	I am nervous about the lady with the sword.
169	144 21 195 44 29 43 78 172 208 84 169	I don't think these chairs belong outdoors. They will get weathered very quickly.
169	108 167 134 35 91 50 197 215 172 80 169	I'm not sure how they are going to feel about blowing out the candles after the burns.
169	125 193 72 146 160 131 85 1 45 206 169	This looks like a place for an accident
169	119 183 4 17 3 207 20 135 48 44 169	Her bizarre smile is making me uncomfortable.
169	36 96 174 152 43 67 22 125 87 155 169	I hope they are going to be safe with that gun.
169	214 3 215 111 97 137 120 187 196 210 169	There's crime around the corner
169	9 42 155 184 130 180 140 120 31 78 169	Oh no! Hold tight!
169	93 175 137 172 104 147 62 146 213 131 169	If the temperature raises even a little all of these flowers will wilt.
169	95 40 19 153 3 181 24 55 97 154 169	Oh you think that's funny?
169	120 35 73 193 155 149 112 100 211 2 169	If she drops that cake ill fire her
169	188 36 190 120 76 68 209 143 25 12 169	These things are so nasty
169	60 80 202 51 131 193 160 117 84 118 169	This little guy is really contemplating life.
169	69 211 215 67 56 27 77 39 196 180 169	I don't even want to know what she sees that gives her that expression.
169	81 67 143 199 18 130 121 153 210 155 169	the minute distance between 156 and 149 is giving me anxiety.
169	161 30 144 31 171 39 199 178 66 62 169	That kid looks like he's too active.
169	182 7 190 50 171 117 55 130 1 57 169	Hope the sand doesnt collapse around anyone and cause them to become suffocated.
169	103 149 144 27 136 23 34 46 183 180 169	I know it's not a red red and more of a maroon red but just the effort that took to figure out has me in need of a stress relieving massage.
169	173 72 158 143 6 132 19 202 209 16 169	The fate of the country rests in their hands.
169	182 83 172 59 199 139 191 152 146 76 169	Beatle to run over the Beatles?
169	28 97 201 51 116 43 155 211 167 36 169	what could have happened in this room? a murder?
169	133 69 74 197 214 21 137 130 165 32 169	I wonder what it was like during that time.
169	159 149 2 106 118 154 203 201 89 104 169	It was difficult hope they understand that number 1 is the one that matters
169	201 204 130 124 115 87 163 16 44 194 169	Looks like a scary ghost
169	114 125 99 212 81 66 193 78 57 2 169	They really need to make bike lanes for people to ride more saftly in.
169	124 211 115 2 205 120 162 80 110 130 169	Something about that look makes me uneasy.
169	206 97 153 76 175 91 13 109 61 65 169	Traffic is brutal!
169	203 58 43 185 75 193 19 136 139 79 169	I sure hope his boat doesn't flip.
169	69 109 164 91 96 116 67 126 167 107 169	This flower makes me think of when I was a kid and my parents were fighting.
169	83 98 166 55 194 168 200 152 37 208 169	I hope a fight doesn't happen.
169	99 105 195 188 35 44 197 73 174 126 169	The bird was unwittingly seconds from a sneak attack by a hawk!
169	23 140 96 71 24 107 84 48 69 184 169	This makes me think of war.
169	200 11 157 196 48 117 190 4 3 204 169	The space behind here is too narrow, it makes me claustrophobic.
169	183 140 55 47 66 149 203 110 89 21 169	Reading old literature makes me nervous.
169	57 148 32 5 13 120 82 15 131 86 169	This wall makes me really wound up.
169	53 40 124 117 145 204 182 83 195 110 169	It stresses me out just imagining trying to parallel park in a room like that.
169	7 166 69 17 84 174 129 79 41 162 169	With so many people there, there is bound to be some sort of mishap.
169	5 111 104 198 56 186 202 174 28 15 169	Those girls are all looking to see when their doctor appointments are.
169	108 182 29 48 188 55 112 8 211 138 169	The sun is just too hot, my skin is burning.
169	158 186 105 64 58 4 77 68 18 74 169	That lake makes me nervous.
169	143 82 215 178 28 145 84 97 39 137 169	He is leaning what is next>
169	71 53 175 179 137 133 214 88 60 66 169	This is an old model of a sail ship, dont judge it
169	31 166 39 14 188 128 206 47 117 62 169	What is the referee thinking about?
169	109 86 27 125 139 198 82 87 11 48 169	A nail biting moment in sport is fantastic and thrill!
169	149 192 10 60 4 132 13 130 27 73 169	That steep curve makes me extremely nervous.
169	27 19 130 99 154 124 118 211 52 38 169	She makes me uncomfortable.
169	88 71 72 199 39 110 151 174 165 94 169	I am a bit worried about meeting my date.
169	113 152 2 203 35 15 5 170 77 157 169	The battery running low is freaking me out
169	27 172 130 87 192 164 204 118 35 114 169	They are going to wreck if they don't start watching the road.
169	133 37 160 81 135 19 16 75 137 82 169	This reminds me of the movie Signs. I imagine an alien could be lurking in the distance.
169	9 5 49 198 19 62 1 167 184 168 169	Don't push her too hard!
169	194 35 89 193 211 181 25 88 155 203 169	Someone may fall off that bike.
169	65 26 99 147 167 208 192 1 63 125 169	There better not be an earthquake while I'm here.
169	107 44 209 196 61 29 78 53 185 39 169	She makes me nervous.
169	165 176 11 129 87 84 15 48 49 163 169	This makes me so uncomfortable to look at.
169	3 21 146 211 157 128 176 73 110 51 169	When the tv screen goes blue and you want to punch someone in the face.
169	146 128 109 127 142 72 204 201 49 129 169	I wish that bird would go on. He makes me nervous.
169	213 45 26 167 158 182 143 170 107 134 169	He's not safe
169	133 124 203 31 15 171 63 190 66 97 169	I hope that baby is ok with the way that he is staring.
169	25 124 212 85 26 176 27 32 141 47 169	This view makes me nervous.
169	175 77 167 22 125 138 129 75 115 34 169	This is too hazy and I don't really like the composition.
169	46 28 99 200 122 148 87 13 143 84 169	Big crowded make me nervous.
169	138 110 121 175 100 195 184 172 161 192 169	Looking at cacti makes me so anxious.  What if someone falls on it,
169	52 166 56 62 189 77 101 162 168 74 169	The kid holding the ball must be nervous about whether not the kicker will clip his hand !
169	142 124 109 9 213 140 85 189 117 31 169	That face on the panda is making me nervous he looks mad.
169	119 159 213 104 84 191 77 49 130 21 169	Those globes make nervous.
169	41 188 209 200 191 61 104 155 79 205 169	The concert really gave me a headache.  I just could stand the guitar sounds over the speakers.
169	136 87 7 3 72 173 94 131 132 170 169	This makes me uncomfortable for some reason.
169	185 159 59 181 16 102 123 96 145 205 169	So awkward if you don't know everyone at the table
169	100 189 53 26 214 55 6 108 10 211 169	These mascots keep me on edge... what are they up to... what's going on behind those eyes...
169	154 81 67 96 92 111 34 79 161 196 169	It's gonna try and eat me
169	5 112 182 183 65 70 168 9 73 74 169	What's in the brown paper bag? I can't imagine it's anything good.

169	100 124 32 49 73 205 214 39 37 158 169	I know it's a shoe, but it's got a face and I don't like how it's looking at me.
169	5 71 184 36 175 159 58 7 61 166 169	Some may see snow, I see hypothermia and the frozen unknown.
169	90 3 47 105 114 160 85 157 76 162 169	I wonder if she is doing good on her test. It makes me super nervous just thinking about it!

169	185 204 48 170 164 22 168 64 37 125 169	She needs to be really careful not to fall off that stage. I'm anxious for her.
169	144 200 65 85 150 177 93 83 204 91 169	This forrest could have snakes in it!
169	154 63 57 210 147 2 206 190 174 48 169	This person will attack another.
169	165 89 172 119 8 133 36 189 55 58 169	It's just weird to see a guy in a blue with beads around his neck, he needs to be careful who he bumps into.
169	164 36 149 25 73 45 84 205 175 16 169	This pink color makes me feel really uptight, like I'm holding in Pepto.

169	31 50 186 142 106 170 2 23 141 89 169	How could they let that milk jug get so rusty?
169	11 206 129 104 36 68 29 164 84 192 169	This area seems like it's in a warzone, which makes me uncomfortable
169	156 108 102 132 155 95 170 125 11 91 169	Kick his a**!
169	129 114 25 106 69 75 136 64 164 29 169	I won this with lots of works and after long hours.

169	9 191 192 42 120 119 151 24 212 206 169	Unbeknownst to these travels they are about to dodge a falling tree to stay alive!
169	200 18 11 202 160 121 15 158 99 64 169	That Ganesh statue looks like it's going to fall on top of me.
169	30 45 34 101 195 192 215 147 213 50 169	They look like they are thinking way too hard about it. Hurry up and make a decision.

169	50 80 95 78 203 184 75 179 111 196 169	I really hope we didn't just stumble over somebody's grave.
169	170 186 188 177 161 96 57 70 180 176 169	This car seems to be very dark and white.
169	66 185 116 106 179 132 94 176 173 93 169	He's really playing that music well.
169	195 83 149 147 104 77 187 80 175 176 169	Close ups of bugs make my lesh crawl.
169	67 109 17 126 75 84 104 106 16 21 169	He looks like he may be up to something bad.
169	18 55 33 85 193 58 188 175 174 12 169	Bees make me sweat.
169	186 126 211 152 133 112 16 135 123 46 169	I hope he doesn't cross the median
169	64 59 108 201 99 158 159 142 187 114 169	Why is she shaking his hand like that?  I feel awkward.
169	15 164 36 132 59 116 75 26 187 22 169	What the hey is that? It looks like its doing damage.
169	212 65 59 107 42 155 58 165 116 140 169	While I think rallying is a great thing, I would not be able to participate for worry of police retaliation.
169	16 184 86 90 41 177 189 36 10 114 169	Nobody can see it
169	75 42 47 174 6 209 96 36 191 164 169	I think they are finally finding out that there is a higher power that is going to destroy us!
169	13 8 157 110 215 148 156 155 128 9 169	You want to avoid a person like this.
169	56 79 206 38 162 209 195 105 156 3 169	What the hell is this guy gonna do? Jeez, I just can't even imagine.
169	154 16 210 40 100 59 151 130 15 172 169	The bitter cold of the ice is squeezing the life out of all organisms.
169	47 150 155 205 211 215 60 191 16 202 169	Im so nervous that he wont break the record

169	8 82 196 176 116 188 212 71 90 5 169	I am afraid of bridges
169	36 111 45 177 135 93 59 113 183 209 169	These people don't know how to dance.
170	198 35 33 107 42 53 37 209 73 4 170	I could ride my bike here all day.

170	183 174 134 144 122 89 52 210 125 76 170	This looks like dreams like I have.
170	38 182 62 136 172 169 88 101 132 168 170	Riding a horse for a civil war reinactment looks like fun!
170	63 172 116 35 22 66 192 56 110 114 170	I hope there's something I can eat in here
170	188 28 55 2 7 155 62 31 207 175 170	Me and my friends painted this awesome mural.
170	5 184 75 140 85 106 210 44 153 31 170	I don't think I would date her since she is not close to my age.
170	209 181 34 196 203 80 111 207 92 110 170	Orang reminds me of oranges!
170	64 39 146 162 32 12 56 42 109 98 170	The kitchen appliances are incredibly retro, which is what millenials these days like.

170	44 82 98 197 169 69 192 128 113 71 170	That place looks so cool
170	168 143 153 13 121 181 209 39 8 95 170	I wonder if I can play this on my toy piano?
170	138 109 2 103 1 49 100 14 19 5 170	What a caring father he looks like.

170	17 50 117 129 164 201 18 176 42 196 170	This tree is soooo spooky and weird.
170	97 135 185 90 101 95 179 11 61 146 170	Back when I was a child I thought that sea horses were just a fairytale.
170	3 153 78 36 165 56 17 162 185 47 170	No more how mich time has gone by, I'll always just be a big kid

170	119 67 143 118 116 140 46 201 38 35 170	I would die for my room to be this neat.
170	205 67 52 128 150 113 164 206 204 53 170	This is so pretty! I always plucked the leaves off my favorite trees and kept them in a scrapbook.
170	29 122 175 104 155 204 142 128 30 16 170	A priest case
170	121 28 48 64 110 78 13 77 171 19 170	These kids are having fun!
170	1 163 75 7 178 91 108 10 199 57 170	We are all waiting to set up for a music festival that lasts all weekend.
170	72 64 13 173 183 209 1 114 33 175 170	That kitty cat is so cute I want it!
170	204 11 65 34 192 80 36 7 94 90 170	So man windows!  Probably wouldn't be great to play baseball there.
170	57 12 171 167 127 165 121 24 157 34 170	This reminds me of a childhood trip to the aquarium.
170	110 202 7 152 45 75 63 116 74 3 170	these are my friends in a race
170	127 210 113 173 131 154 11 166 31 169 170	That looks sick.
170	167 131 17 69 89 37 107 200 176 118 170	I bet it was a fun concert
170	166 62 124 12 4 24 98 213 155 150 170	Don't you just love sitting on the steps when no one is around?
170	215 167 97 202 4 105 30 156 20 71 170	you all look tight
170	69 23 90 26 15 55 34 169 119 14 170	Ah! I remember sitting out in the rain for a sporting event and a concert or two as well!
170	183 135 172 166 6 163 92 121 62 137 170	This reminds me of Play Dough.
170	191 174 106 96 43 151 156 16 61 185 170	I like turtles
170	22 196 104 129 114 42 161 10 87 99 170	This is just like my favorite matchbox car!
170	92 195 173 157 156 1 98 10 202 64 170	This bodega has candy.
170	62 163 155 129 70 78 45 202 24 88 170	really nice colors
170	181 176 165 35 155 32 194 129 65 100 170	Well, thats a funny looking thing right there.
170	7 21 95 11 141 210 33 176 126 205 170	As a child I would play here for hours pretending I was a prince.
170	81 204 64 40 75 183 97 177 109 203 170	Those flowers remind me of easter and egg hunting.
170	37 65 64 192 94 184 4 3 214 179 170	This colour is my favourite to paint with!
170	184 169 175 61 190 104 206 201 157 200 170	That looks like a fun rock to climb!
170	37 196 55 103 159 151 194 87 70 167 170	I could make so much with this
170	137 144 145 80 20 77 37 184 127 175 170	I could weave rugs like that all night!
170	172 97 169 72 74 142 166 182 3 39 170	I'd sure love to go dancing in this rain.
170	59 193 178 137 158 30 93 67 13 113 170	Many young people type on computers.
170	38 123 138 49 81 103 152 198 119 6 170	I'd love to learn how to play with this group, so fun!
170	195 43 46 29 5 157 59 114 88 102 170	I remember being a young boy as if it were yesterday. Indeed, it was.
170	201 167 193 118 150 157 86 169 121 47 170	They seem pretty happy together.
170	1 213 163 39 165 162 96 195 65 210 170	I want to be part of such a team of enthusiastic youngsters
170	117 96 154 143 120 97 88 123 61 90 170	My bike when I was younger was this color. Imagine flying through the streets on a cool fall afternoon again!
170	82 36 78 54 138 194 104 198 157 212 170	Everything is new and amazing!
170	205 107 61 128 31 116 209 164 208 122 170	I bet these rocks would be super fun to climb!
170	190 135 12 117 144 214 169 38 127 7 170	There's no hot dogs in it.
170	130 118 58 112 34 89 164 163 136 98 170	The teachers retreat was a great experience that made us feel like kids again!
170	164 55 71 135 179 60 157 181 54 120 170	OMG, she is so pretty!
170	190 57 194 107 71 96 69 3 8 188 170	The colorfulness of this bring me back to walking in meadows when I was younger.
170	72 132 25 54 13 147 202 185 24 191 170	Even though they are older the keep a sense of youth still.
170	213 42 19 57 47 11 25 101 21 125 170	I can see myself just spending a year backpacking through places like this. No school, nothing tying me down.

170	33 191 46 111 159 155 150 76 162 36 170	We can steal this and put on a wall like a painting
170	131 153 152 57 2 92 21 132 198 133 170	They look boring, lets go partying and leave them talking.
170	172 114 4 185 28 64 128 136 65 6 170	This graffiti makes me feel young.

170	38 175 206 79 152 120 168 183 46 156 170	Reminds me of my youth, and my son noe
170	64 20 199 82 208 132 126 17 200 211 170	If you blow on one of those, you'll get to see a beautiful cloud float away.
170	173 121 69 3 122 192 118 58 185 94 170	Oh my gosh! Those light up guys in the back are so cute! I think I've seen them on TV?

170	22 152 136 192 14 130 142 153 112 127 170	I can't wait to get out there and take a few swings with the bat.
170	117 76 49 47 158 24 11 147 167 146 170	This color reminds me of when I was young
170	60 199 12 140 93 176 69 132 153 169 170	these tiles are the ones I want my bedroom

170	32 158 63 176 39 121 190 126 134 194 170	I'd pay you $5 to streak across this road.
170	154 173 123 78 65 205 15 127 148 200 170	One of my dreams is to ride a shark, is that silly?
170	44 148 67 81 166 7 160 108 139 112 170	I wonder if I can balance on the top of that stone.
170	95 102 94 175 192 124 107 210 168 162 170	oooooo. Someone's in trouble. They used the "D" word!
170	177 121 61 158 128 101 28 154 194 116 170	If I were twenty again I would get out there and hike those mountains.
170	36 202 114 5 214 60 195 119 179 104 170	Bouncing balls were always my favorite toy when I was a kid!

170	1 176 16 162 58 175 146 76 6 134 170	I hope they teach something cool.  School can be so boring some times.
170	46 113 106 21 29 179 164 125 23 33 170	I can remember fixing my own childhood bike, on my lawn, in the warm summer evening.
170	206 133 44 180 203 74 119 94 158 27 170	Riding the bus is fun.
170	127 140 117 32 22 73 42 144 76 138 170	That monkey has a red face.

170	49 189 149 210 155 43 159 53 105 42 170	So many people on this train going everywhewre.

170	5 190 11 212 133 187 52 108 23 20 170	Flying this plane for the first time can really be a thrill, like playing a game on the internet.
170	42 162 168 13 172 4 36 30 126 146 170	I want to be rich when I grow up.

170	201 196 127 54 68 44 80 88 9 175 170	This fashion show is important for teenagers my age striving to be models.

170	51 193 177 1 116 2 201 168 203 106 170	Gray isn't dismal. It is the perfect combination of black and white.
170	41 131 173 132 168 204 69 45 197 65 170	This is beautiful. I love waking up early to the sunrise.

170	67 181 215 133 109 137 141 105 206 60 170	I really have no idea what this image is trying to depict but it sure looks like fun with the tambourine and the bugle horns.
170	9 204 172 189 213 62 103 117 68 6 170	Wearing great smiles make them look young.

170	9 58 146 74 182 158 54 36 193 162 170	What`s the smile while eating
170	55 165 211 129 80 32 109 33 36 67 170	People aspiring to remain in our hearts, but we have time to achieve better things like them!
170	127 76 187 19 62 111 101 72 186 39 170	So pretty!  I'd pick it and give it to Mommy.

170	43 103 28 150 52 163 105 128 141 46 170	Wow love the way they stuck the whole city together with that white stuff.
170	10 77 8 33 14 36 105 44 181 37 170	Ugghh this car has no style.  I would lower it and add a killer sounds system.
170	209 103 41 118 105 94 20 88 164 129 170	This is so boring I'm ready to get out of here.
170	151 38 46 93 69 14 155 58 39 131 170	Spending 5 dollars a day on these. I miss college.

170	49 47 161 212 92 121 135 208 171 44 170	This show looks like a lot of fun!
170	186 215 80 116 98 142 63 100 110 54 170	That's what you get for staying in the water so long--you're so puny!

171	126 57 60 143 42 110 206 103 158 204 171	The plants are very strict about how to grow
171	74 130 22 187 143 96 77 19 160 33 171	I can feel the peace and serenity these people must have felt now. Though I do wonder about those green lights.
171	88 161 60 128 114 200 57 63 177 158 171	You have to cherish moments like this.
171	168 7 59 35 21 158 148 144 14 100 171	Do not play with the animal it may bite
171	131 134 95 57 140 110 91 112 35 188 171	That is pretty interesting. The person that took this is probably procrastinating though.
171	130 44 143 78 118 144 91 108 64 94 171	The dog is significant to the room
171	104 57 215 108 90 178 58 208 203 53 171	I'm determined to win too.
171	71 154 157 93 173 116 124 206 100 140 171	Mushrooms are technically not a vegetable, they more closely resemble a living organism.  This should be taken into consideration if you're a serious vegan.
171	18 176 194 165 117 77 129 35 195 32 171	This looks like it could be a very profitable place to do business.
171	62 153 43 69 50 149 52 184 151 180 171	I hope they have someone guarding the boats otherwise someone might steal them.
171	183 57 96 115 132 140 188 34 180 137 171	These guys may be striking a drug deal here, and it might be their best source of income.
171	145 160 2 77 108 124 210 10 85 13 171	Must be something on the inside
171	42 1 35 184 69 155 131 73 53 146 171	Plants are green because of Chlorophyll.
171	199 118 29 25 180 179 213 160 103 132 171	Thank you for bringing attention to this. It is important to pay attention to store signs so each consumer can be aware of the pricing.
171	94 69 122 168 60 123 137 84 34 144 171	Looks lovely to hike in, nice scenery

171	176 148 152 72 154 71 80 31 159 27 171	The clouds are beautiful in contrast to the eagle.
171	18 101 106 121 89 152 117 34 9 163 171	Wow, I sure hope all these people are using the proper SF 30 sunscreen cause otherwise they can get skin cancer!
171	170 167 116 97 65 111 180 148 200 107 171	This is very blue and somber.
171	58 139 201 49 101 185 119 189 90 187 171	You really just said that?
171	56 94 115 63 201 209 51 158 204 102 171	A double-decker is a great option for tourists.
171	95 145 196 28 210 97 40 70 14 8 171	Everyone see's their own cage.
171	22 195 41 3 158 123 64 170 197 160 171	She should go under to practice her breathing!
171	198 110 159 196 15 178 65 161 180 191 171	Maintaining perfect posture while meeting the Queen is a way of showing respect.
171	14 71 137 139 39 55 205 155 146 203 171	an error in this place must be serious
171	69 74 3 127 115 43 110 37 201 147 171	My favorite color is purple.
171	117 206 136 122 60 16 190 97 201 191 171	This fishing pole will catch tonight's dinner.
171	161 116 46 12 25 108 98 152 188 1 171	Beer isn't healthy for you at all.
171	55 161 199 141 81 211 108 156 194 38 171	This place looks quiet.
171	79 187 163 160 48 110 168 166 142 167 171	I hope they are always this happy, and not just posing on camera.
171	76 185 43 77 36 115 108 205 106 31 171	Everyone gathered around for a little speech
171	65 35 200 34 163 99 26 214 36 131 171	The conservation of animals such as this pygmy hippo is very important to our environment.
171	147 126 73 197 168 139 210 113 93 120 171	I'm not sure what this is supposed to be, but I think it's a horse. I've never seen a horse that looks like this though.
171	33 161 176 155 177 132 76 193 70 9 171	congratulations! what an accomplishment
171	18 66 36 128 150 77 79 35 48 67 171	That child has a very clear objective.
171	27 182 73 201 80 84 37 108 31 184 171	This is structure is very narrow.
171	122 17 208 42 73 41 98 161 25 87 171	Three attractive stone inlaid steps with designer tile
171	29 152 196 49 199 118 82 53 1 8 171	Obviously the maternal instinct is very prevalent in this female.
171	179 91 63 1 199 47 69 74 151 3 171	I am damn determined to travel the globe.
171	165 22 186 3 144 205 97 14 95 38 171	The flawless stone work and stern pointed roof makes for a solid piece of historic architecture.
171	25 174 9 191 43 76 135 30 139 207 171	That building is very long. I don't even want to know how much the electric bill is.
171	13 157 148 10 177 197 113 106 60 212 171	Seriously where is the closest potty.
171	184 98 25 63 92 49 64 190 207 203 171	It must've taken much preparation to set up everything for this show.
171	109 177 186 103 167 36 79 117 16 187 171	I am not sure, but I feel as though December 22nd is the longest day
171	183 142 151 134 92 179 54 73 140 42 171	Signs should be on walls not held.
171	109 3 16 22 40 115 157 162 123 101 171	I think if they play team ball, they can win this thing this year.
171	62 183 77 168 61 186 165 95 104 148 171	I hope I remembered the water.
171	192 40 158 84 134 118 19 86 170 177 171	This is my daughter's thinking corner for when she misbehaves.
171	173 181 87 78 47 205 165 24 195 65 171	This is a sad wedding event.
171	53 143 151 152 51 5 131 44 100 69 171	Beautiful weather and a beautiful well maintained plane.
171	20 61 92 155 112 119 143 69 163 95 171	that is too much breakable items on that shelf for a kid to be in that room.
171	74 206 75 102 13 141 211 60 150 147 171	can a domino effect do any magic here?
171	112 183 6 162 161 29 111 101 213 13 171	What is she doing? I don't get the point.
171	157 99 175 29 167 7 156 102 192 97 171	Glad to see he's wearing his safety wear. Drowning's no fun!
171	61 73 136 204 9 4 48 76 47 37 171	I sit here watching these men jump up and down in bathrobes.
171	35 116 158 125 103 134 84 145 184 169 171	This is a representation of the universe.
171	193 68 43 63 115 98 210 116 134 127 171	Up here, we can see it all.
171	107 63 17 15 181 151 173 141 154 47 171	That is a very interesting looking item.
171	183 96 42 150 10 50 15 40 100 20 171	This is history.
171	12 167 141 104 5 26 132 49 127 41 171	It is one lane only!
171	62 149 150 167 148 39 36 163 24 46 171	I can see the sun and it hurts my eyes.
171	175 73 77 152 116 18 87 80 183 64 171	She needs to be more serious.
171	36 84 75 60 90 16 97 145 183 68 171	Don't touch that plant!
171	8 48 77 163 62 146 105 22 111 174 171	This is where to get the tickets for an unforgettable journey
171	117 83 64 122 63 119 39 91 99 92 171	Climbing that mountainf would be tough on me.
171	42 95 167 153 181 65 150 130 111 15 171	These woods are in serious risk of fire.
171	88 74 6 98 29 187 67 129 117 22 171	Looks like a storm is coming.
171	8 167 138 92 166 51 125 40 81 191 171	Not sure what they'd call this, "mauve" maybe?
171	81 18 115 51 19 76 48 65 64 12 171	Oh man this music is so moving
171	213 138 116 157 202 118 126 24 43 64 171	You must consider that these flowers look slightly dead.
171	50 151 36 47 69 186 33 6 190 121 171	No birds in the view.
171	122 192 134 93 23 39 90 180 185 147 171	I wonder what historic place this is?
171	139 4 3 90 75 1 14 107 128 71 171	Fish are here to hunt.
171	43 145 134 166 16 78 213 208 181 141 171	I found these in our water supply! Should I be worried?
171	210 144 78 86 33 28 164 152 41 103 171	I would not visit hills with such levels of smog, at all
171	87 149 46 134 204 165 207 80 19 12 171	That's an old fashioned pot.
171	30 10 156 19 133 9 24 29 157 152 171	These three need to be careful or they could fall off the cliff.
171	2 45 89 178 174 64 155 189 125 49 171	What a beautiful piece,  I think it is very expensive
171	153 16 204 57 58 49 117 155 162 44 171	We need to keep our beaches clean.
171	143 209 64 162 131 92 155 72 124 32 171	I dont like that color, I prefer a black tone.
171	164 210 127 67 8 124 114 100 50 31 171	I can't believe people still use wallpaper. That is so out of fashion these days.
171	125 21 49 168 137 113 176 134 157 108 171	I think we should close this gate now.
171	149 111 168 101 49 104 135 7 119 24 171	The look on the cats face is ready to pounce something.
171	79 57 146 86 32 25 208 130 161 51 171	Oh, please can I have an overnight here.
171	201 71 147 140 24 165 65 143 73 34 171	It was at this moment he knew the gravity of his error
171	11 144 25 21 29 201 202 108 91 44 171	THOSE SWANS ARE IN DIRTY WATER
171	210 33 67 63 3 151 81 215 44 91 171	They should get married sooner than later.
171	92 43 85 6 100 9 78 167 107 84 171	Francine definitely does not like the new ingredients in her venti latte.
171	68 113 31 207 32 166 38 1 13 44 171	This is a well-crafted window.
171	212 121 2 119 91 23 45 215 7 128 171	The sign is due to be repainted.
171	162 56 116 6 206 179 144 55 82 92 171	This color makes me very stoic.
171	62 34 189 49 112 13 17 10 215 164 171	I wish I could ride again
171	85 9 46 86 92 106 160 110 136 93 171	They look like they enjoy soccer.
171	178 137 122 25 47 9 104 152 37 141 171	Is there someone out there?
171	107 8 94 50 67 170 9 4 203 48 171	I wish I could find more useful information like this online.
171	60 138 99 35 86 113 50 33 71 102 171	It is too hot to be pushing sales on people.
171	5 25 71 16 160 120 30 107 23 173 171	I hope that architects never stop creating beautiful structures. It is design that keeps our minds engaged.
171	209 109 169 206 136 189 82 88 75 199 171	What is this color? I find it very offputting.
171	206 78 37 60 123 96 110 189 55 176 171	It is hard to remember how to put this back together.
171	76 146 57 103 201 79 193 91 55 92 171	I believe this is a very formal event.
171	33 32 13 105 53 55 6 194 54 150 171	They are well prepared if it rains.
171	195 37 27 110 128 3 139 191 190 91 171	That is some water there.
171	14 49 66 40 147 53 94 176 191 23 171	This is a dangerous building.
171	137 147 157 138 111 66 42 179 27 71 171	More children should be doing physical activities instead of playing video games all day.
171	20 168 44 96 101 195 103 137 126 90 171	The bunny looks scared
171	52 126 28 121 176 168 40 55 194 29 171	I can't stop staring at this girl's behind.
171	51 164 63 29 69 85 195 141 99 34 171	THE WIND IS BLOWING NORTH.
171	170 181 20 141 168 16 150 84 195 106 171	A wharf at night can be a very dangerous place.
171	155 28 83 26 174 90 130 145 17 10 171	This is an important statue to our history.
171	81 43 64 20 160 139 19 58 39 13 171	The skirt really fits the shape of her body.
171	38 190 41 99 24 104 8 29 15 188 171	That car is from the 1960's.
171	126 73 20 16 67 4 82 138 45 48 171	I hope that he does not get nervous while on stage.
171	212 178 83 170 5 76 114 4 128 97 171	They seem like they are really happy to finally get out he military hospital.
171	114 144 81 168 200 88 37 9 75 199 171	People don't enjoy the wonders of nature.
171	193 140 162 28 152 7 69 105 189 178 171	They better not be lining up.
171	71 132 49 20 122 72 4 159 156 95 171	This shoe is filled with germs.
171	117 110 111 166 163 194 205 139 40 147 171	Looks like a hard business torun
171	207 69 189 68 205 127 31 168 117 158 171	The production team was very careful with the equipment as their meager budget won't allow for any replacements.
171	38 105 3 16 59 21 164 88 92 174 171	That's a grave face. I doubt whatever he's saying is good news.
171	206 48 16 67 200 179 164 21 162 129 171	They could kill someone if they fall
171	71 109 135 61 48 131 198 9 107 88 171	The owners should repair the asphalt shingles or the structure will start to degrade.
171	121 181 106 92 73 166 42 151 62 168 171	Do you see any animals in the back yard?
171	119 128 91 33 78 90 184 57 30 3 171	I think they are too close to the street.  A car could hit them.
171	194 69 117 30 84 130 36 132 20 190 171	This is a very prestigious statue.
171	169 100 53 211 79 80 194 60 8 127 171	The flowers around me are dying
171	138 41 132 50 148 104 43 213 189 123 171	This form of architecture is a dying breed and needs to be preserved.
171	10 93 122 99 166 190 120 98 68 101 171	Is there even a light in there? All of the cables make me question it's reliability.
171	120 173 28 3 77 201 172 74 25 140 171	That looks like a poisonous thing
171	139 44 97 124 84 38 102 121 103 74 171	The police car stops
171	134 86 30 69 209 159 24 1 121 129 171	This is an important lesson. He should be listening and not taking pictures.
171	106 7 167 92 119 138 75 164 50 150 171	This looks like a dangerous and run-down part of town
171	196 146 185 127 195 70 84 73 190 39 171	It looks so hot and desolate there.
171	214 90 177 81 180 60 49 4 110 205 171	These days women are the ones more focused on their career!
171	140 178 143 86 32 99 75 172 27 11 171	She reminds me of my clubbing days; happy on the outside but depressed on the inside.
171	154 119 152 73 190 90 165 177 17 92 171	This blank blue picture is rather dull, don't you think?
171	54 182 110 48 128 79 164 156 100 78 171	Turning 2 is a major milestone. I hope this cake demonstrates the child has reached all the important benchmarks.
171	139 61 60 185 122 113 153 13 56 66 171	the calmness of this image is good for the sole
171	64 215 136 28 38 205 119 70 128 126 171	The weather is good
171	93 187 198 10 137 77 96 26 58 207 171	that device can start a fire
171	161 40 72 187 63 148 103 152 94 22 171	The city skyline is serene.
171	29 143 209 12 191 179 136 85 7 208 171	This is coats on a hook.
171	36 212 73 165 62 66 206 107 113 33 171	this is an architectural accomplishment that should be recognized.
171	181 103 80 57 154 54 47 110 85 72 171	His lips prove that this was a serious moment.
171	80 19 122 49 156 31 75 166 3 149 171	it is fearful
171	173 51 152 157 28 214 187 44 25 169 171	Now, we are getting down for some, real, racing.
171	202 81 165 127 32 109 131 144 75 52 171	Such old fashioned script, a true lost art.
171	105 30 178 25 181 68 204 55 164 149 171	The baby looks like a new born.
171	184 198 10 17 66 189 106 53 210 59 171	This is nothing but blue
171	132 93 48 82 44 106 12 186 104 167 171	This is my childhood home I have lots of memories
171	195 81 34 190 196 113 8 112 201 76 171	We are having great time and feel in love.
171	157 56 117 196 95 107 19 88 50 12 171	These sweaters are destroying our youth.
171	203 136 82 157 63 165 98 22 40 99 171	I hope Gina's cancer does not come back.
171	37 187 24 59 146 200 206 94 3 201 171	it was aperfect pile up.. i bet it costs more to retreat
171	98 137 149 200 163 158 82 40 8 16 171	The picture is very messy and the whole area needs to be tidied up and I will be campaigning for that.
171	156 213 146 72 85 114 180 112 205 168 171	This person is doing a lot of thinking about life.
171	180 82 91 131 164 10 183 92 22 148 171	I wish I could read that sign. What is she smiling about?
171	180 3 145 176 19 125 96 165 162 92 171	I'm looking in there for useful plants.
171	185 165 173 11 49 70 55 71 53 117 171	There might be gold under that.
171	36 62 101 131 133 72 91 167 35 100 171	Business is logical and not humorous.
171	67 176 190 201 148 177 116 192 3 4 171	I've heard of a building like this reflecting light and melting a car across the street. It's no joke
171	181 138 87 2 143 3 101 43 172 165 171	This union is forever.  I hope they don't take it lightly.
171	212 96 60 155 141 196 19 152 4 95 171	That's quite the mouthful of a name
171	167 127 92 83 162 38 9 179 125 150 171	This is a timeless Olympic tradition that should never be disrespected under any circumstance
171	40 10 43 145 197 47 90 143 122 187 171	What is this holiday? the colors look like blood.

172	110 128 93 68 188 13 9 159 3 11 172	I see a picture in this color that those of feebler mind cannot even grasp.
172	69 95 8 203 180 49 139 128 42 176 172	This type of environment is so dry that it actually gets less than 1 inch of rainfall per year!
172	155 193 118 53 107 48 176 142 124 168 172	This sound mixer looks very professional.
172	105 200 81 78 182 74 145 66 75 13 172	I think this is the original tiny house. Fit for a princess!
172	61 138 198 105 153 58 186 36 139 56 172	I don't know what it says but I know it must mean "WOW"!
172	41 11 40 53 185 92 95 192 168 120 172	That's a beautiful juxtaposition of color, shapes and angles present in that photograph.
172	107 201 105 114 155 184 187 87 158 43 172	I love the symmetry of this photo. The composition is astounding.
172	9 196 105 2 99 54 26 98 44 211 172	Good lord man!  You're going to hurt yourself with that much food!
172	208 23 44 93 141 136 49 134 3 175 172	These colors are so bright and complex.
172	3 34 150 112 109 160 129 75 168 4 172	That is amethyst.
172	152 203 15 39 94 69 66 132 29 189 172	looks like a great place for a Sunday walk
172	146 128 199 148 3 161 190 22 120 101 172	The contrasting wood tones and classic arciletual elements make this foyer functional and beautiful.
172	6 86 100 181 1 206 70 77 185 113 172	that flower is so bright the sun reflects the color so well.
172	47 84 48 173 102 176 54 43 199 196 172	This is undoubtedly a hot day.  The people must wear sunscreen if they don't want to suffer.
172	54 152 122 129 3 128 119 145 169 9 172	The bass is a very difficult instrument to master, you must have a very dexterous hand a strong mind.
172	24 43 30 80 48 103 122 85 90 180 172	They are embarking on a wild journey.
172	87 120 155 74 181 180 122 66 157 9 172	Now, this guy has the smarts, apparently.
172	78 160 150 203 133 94 128 176 81 35 172	That motorcycle is magnificent.
172	69 61 215 84 117 22 108 40 186 203 172	The horse is elegant
172	173 109 176 64 206 56 15 12 19 91 172	They have the fire in their eyes!
172	37 165 93 63 7 38 130 152 150 79 172	By the clear observation, it can be seen that landscape is very different.
172	42 43 69 2 114 92 3 149 164 146 172	What an alluring sample of automobile!
172	95 211 83 85 59 177 34 69 50 107 172	The efficiency of the taxi service at the airport is nothing short of amazing!
172	136 181 111 154 19 214 118 213 174 184 172	What a smashing, lovely Christmas display!
172	184 91 151 127 87 5 77 179 122 67 172	Art enthusiast, take note. The landscape portrayed here is the needle hidden in the proverbial haystack commonly referred to as "natural beauty". The trees, with their thin trunks and luscious branches gives way to lively forest that sites under the overcast sky. The sun, while absent, is ever present within the calm waters. The grass is not well-maintained, leading onlookers to feel personally connected. "This landscape is breathtaking, but I deserve it." Captivating.
172	150 63 49 35 39 160 56 182 38 93 172	This is next level avanat garde art
172	108 204 65 148 213 161 45 15 99 129 172	Tree's do stand pretty mighty.
172	76 110 83 211 158 186 108 57 65 166 172	The flower is one of the last of it's kind.
172	159 99 110 189 106 12 60 57 108 76 172	This stately home shows the kind of living quarters that I would accept as a bare minimum.
172	84 86 80 59 188 85 191 79 154 83 172	The waves blend in with the white sand beach perfectly
172	94 204 165 183 153 4 15 27 114 47 172	Sheep are eating at such a fast rate dy/dx.
172	194 24 119 70 45 48 128 207 81 151 172	I believe that I could make a Ferris wheel like this in the modern day with all the benefits of today technology.
172	106 178 171 211 158 88 206 170 140 69 172	A nice freeze frame of someone eating.
172	9 74 158 110 61 124 26 86 21 2 172	Love that turret!
172	114 21 108 202 63 42 52 85 24 99 172	Grey is actually all other colors reflected
172	42 178 181 206 54 4 123 105 176 90 172	Those are some kind of geodes
172	64 19 204 118 92 166 63 116 61 203 172	The foreground shoes the light pole. that is the basis for the image.
172	152 146 167 185 207 183 73 33 10 96 172	The incandescent lighting really glows nicely on them
172	49 83 1 5 27 46 175 137 136 112 172	That dress is likely made from a textile that the girl will never think about the properties of.
172	180 76 201 1 196 71 191 165 127 161 172	Never has a portrayal of the ancient grecian culture been so adequately displayed on a thought provoking level.
172	199 156 101 47 166 102 67 115 185 117 172	This is the green screen special effects are filmed on
172	205 169 21 178 90 170 112 96 176 8 172	the girls think in our mind
172	170 148 126 38 30 8 181 156 65 91 172	I think it's going to be a great game!
172	7 59 13 174 108 141 179 31 30 33 172	I think this photo needs a little more, no less, people. Nay, NO people!
172	34 148 22 109 152 74 38 19 183 178 172	Notice the transition between the snow and the grass.
172	100 198 203 54 83 130 92 136 213 181 172	Look at the smart way she is bouncing the ball
172	148 205 193 174 3 112 75 67 210 178 172	The type of tie this gentleman is wearing is called a double Windsor and it was named after a member of the British Windsor estate.
172	79 49 143 4 101 37 115 133 30 205 172	Working to better themselves
172	146 165 28 84 92 49 10 213 118 189 172	She is on the beach which has sand on it.
172	54 168 77 127 12 124 59 134 75 189 172	Just think of the masterful architectural plan God must have had when He created this!
172	6 127 167 25 16 195 57 14 169 27 172	The quality of this penny is exceptional.
172	112 128 152 8 181 179 17 39 52 140 172	This is the last of the soccer collection.
172	64 39 86 90 16 121 211 196 21 27 172	By 2025 we will have chips in our ears to communicate.
172	73 106 146 53 168 192 110 58 2 3 172	The mansion on the hilltop above the sedges is marvelous.
172	171 38 144 132 11 162 3 200 61 145 172	She really wants the flower, but if she was smart, she wouldn't get in the water.
172	6 53 108 168 165 97 52 83 209 147 172	What an artistic perspective, the reflection in the door knob.
172	51 5 31 195 122 140 59 61 181 127 172	The contrast between light and dark in this room makes this picture pop
172	165 45 69 16 94 183 177 122 35 106 172	Using an old Aztec fishing technique..if done properly yields 50% more catch than average commercial boat!
172	87 167 50 137 33 126 65 53 143 194 172	The way this flower was designed is quite astonishing
172	99 90 30 65 158 48 189 88 95 182 172	Ancient ruins show that the Incas had a knack for complex architecture and modern plumbing methods. Without the aid of 21st century technology!
172	57 71 98 33 188 8 170 12 24 152 172	That design in the top is amazing!
172	205 204 177 29 150 9 17 58 73 81 172	What a well written piece. Historic landmarks a very important part of our country
173	101 205 25 114 106 33 134 20 169 5 173	They are probably skipping school right now.
173	88 37 127 196 193 118 170 19 92 148 173	These two were seen down by my tree, guess I'll go down there.
173	192 64 129 151 54 167 106 179 144 69 173	Well this is a dull building, I wouldn't shop here.
173	140 13 24 56 57 34 103 123 145 21 173	This fish has large fins for swimming.
173	133 8 38 188 193 69 37 132 210 81 173	why do you care about them, i just want the drink
173	82 80 46 27 35 11 103 118 64 67 173	Those waves look about right for surfing.
173	180 52 20 114 172 79 209 197 89 201 173	Cars get us from point A to point B. No other point to them.
173	57 28 114 152 181 158 107 203 10 169 173	This is the widest building in all of Europe
173	13 113 55 119 50 33 126 101 14 105 173	ehhh idk whats going on here
173	9 130 106 108 71 140 206 146 91 175 173	Bermuda Triangle again
173	123 176 196 169 177 128 83 178 74 209 173	That metal is older than most people alive.
173	1 17 111 48 159 61 15 113 38 52 173	I don't know what this is.
173	195 111 24 85 18 160 181 152 79 154 173	Looks like a suitable place to walk.
173	42 133 20 201 35 55 94 31 86 93 173	I think that this is actually in Chinese.
173	212 99 120 67 106 203 151 148 107 211 173	I could walk here.
173	108 150 93 11 52 138 103 95 207 123 173	This picture is dark.
173	94 196 57 200 109 88 212 164 118 4 173	This is a house in the countryside. It could possibly be a farm house.
173	62 41 44 135 93 200 106 67 166 23 173	How mundane. And it's roped off?
173	30 174 102 52 85 9 180 212 128 172 173	The woman is so matter of fact
173	174 34 16 185 63 210 42 15 167 65 173	apathetic, impassive, sober
173	18 160 211 55 148 80 181 97 153 100 173	They dotted my plate
173	125 184 144 175 183 63 37 209 69 139 173	A heroic looking chap out for a ride
173	199 69 132 170 38 59 17 97 118 76 173	Yep, that's our flag.
173	98 190 10 92 147 158 65 47 118 202 173	Lots of people at the bridge today
173	146 47 186 72 177 26 4 168 87 147 173	That is a lot of work in a small space.
173	24 87 30 103 62 159 124 165 144 32 173	I doubt these five men have ever stood in a wedding.
173	40 117 47 48 198 133 125 20 53 179 173	these women are fast
173	163 89 28 138 143 104 171 200 36 155 173	Trees are an example of nature.
173	136 140 163 143 33 214 69 117 53 23 173	This dragon fly is resting its wings after flying in search of food.
173	23 36 190 14 1 43 99 51 88 7 173	Toilet paper is for personal hygiene, not whatever this is.
173	116 76 133 53 64 2 172 24 63 183 173	This is a baseball game.
173	114 126 190 187 7 111 159 192 178 183 173	This port on my laptop does not work for what I need it for.
173	128 18 206 80 99 46 30 74 182 28 173	Why even take this picture?
173	170 56 213 195 21 122 30 188 114 169 173	She made her dinner angrily
173	201 182 185 54 166 150 39 189 65 58 173	Flying into the unknown.
173	126 100 129 51 14 84 114 15 31 150 173	Another year of beautiful filmmaking.
173	97 7 74 58 20 123 177 44 214 72 173	This wild animal probably spends his entire days locked in a cage.
173	128 148 142 153 120 76 186 8 28 47 173	Yes I guess this is a beautiful sky.
173	210 110 108 120 59 57 113 74 32 21 173	Oh this is a strange set up indeed.
173	93 28 92 38 125 74 157 46 88 181 173	This is a very gray piece of art.
173	125 207 47 135 139 154 163 151 145 104 173	A woman jogs near the city.
173	51 118 161 194 148 169 66 185 132 11 173	This storm will wash out the sand.
173	201 170 48 147 50 113 22 40 90 91 173	who did these belong to?
173	5 33 83 161 114 146 3 119 85 51 173	a hole in the ground to pound
173	110 201 192 35 172 50 34 117 195 144 173	Flights have all but lost their magic for me, I'm always travelling.
173	54 146 27 86 19 26 155 15 168 166 173	There is a man
173	106 192 79 24 71 189 28 89 113 143 173	Those people are sitting down
173	64 99 160 17 32 181 214 118 101 178 173	Many people enjoy singing.
173	70 37 119 176 187 26 20 73 99 159 173	The presentation was very thoughtful and thorough.
173	205 193 67 4 146 5 147 56 83 75 173	This is a machine.
173	57 97 153 164 46 3 36 133 204 183 173	It appears they are playing lacrosse
173	174 18 144 213 134 26 27 25 58 135 173	The waters will erase this message sooner than you think. Pointless.
173	44 7 4 207 102 123 72 125 9 184 173	The traffic seems light.
173	177 176 140 191 44 213 121 43 66 36 173	This vantage point is highly efficient for frequent sightings.
173	178 65 88 15 56 186 206 128 133 39 173	A proficient layout
173	175 114 184 64 58 207 21 202 182 72 173	One day you'll reach the end of the road.
173	40 76 51 187 41 182 72 48 111 83 173	I'm sure there's plenty of money involved with that. Just look at that structure.
173	18 124 79 8 19 189 212 109 136 99 173	A foreign land
173	82 19 102 161 171 144 213 210 52 16 173	That license is improperly mounted to your dashboard. It needs to go above the rear view mirror.
173	98 95 13 206 7 160 61 49 152 177 173	This is a big ship isn't it?
173	30 74 59 212 21 179 142 104 58 208 173	It is the boy's birthday.
173	61 98 31 52 93 103 35 91 144 78 173	The rocks look sharp.
173	66 143 191 18 157 3 11 71 105 92 173	Someone forgot to put on shoes.
173	211 181 166 139 82 5 76 44 101 12 173	Welp, I'm going blind. It was bound to happen eventually.
173	78 185 164 93 83 178 16 61 205 29 173	The most boring game ever
173	142 44 110 102 6 9 14 123 154 66 173	Is he a coach or something?
173	163 101 211 40 130 169 86 10 105 37 173	This menu is very limited.
173	95 39 40 87 189 91 132 191 26 118 173	a family photo will child out of frame
173	193 68 3 82 81 135 208 198 190 174 173	That is a dog.
173	105 128 130 199 4 73 211 62 214 67 173	These look like flags.
173	146 80 69 167 51 89 200 91 132 194 173	Too many lights are on
173	81 115 71 96 24 171 130 210 122 5 173	This was the play of the year, but to me nothing special happened.
173	51 138 73 38 170 103 152 107 163 211 173	Those donuts are sugary.
173	179 40 52 118 74 100 34 187 90 11 173	Must be a botanical garden
173	127 50 209 30 130 136 72 95 133 205 173	Lots of dead bodies down there.
173	141 93 65 26 106 191 122 70 69 5 173	this is the color of puke.
173	112 122 116 13 181 119 164 76 213 14 173	Well that is a great point Karen, but i do not care.
173	215 207 186 56 81 148 101 213 153 6 173	Just another day at the park.
173	75 206 138 52 139 191 84 190 28 189 173	That's a full plate.
173	53 159 52 213 89 74 214 65 116 92 173	That is a nice cake.
173	114 174 17 22 152 159 51 20 3 34 173	There's a man in this picture.
173	168 127 90 80 170 83 10 50 22 139 173	i dont get why they are all outside
173	200 10 186 204 127 9 40 196 23 189 173	This is what life is about- everything and nothing.
173	67 99 127 139 204 181 79 174 184 44 173	those books look like they have not been read in years
173	106 92 57 96 200 210 207 107 78 160 173	Like this rally is doing any good.
173	204 167 181 184 144 10 96 110 156 185 173	Hey, there's a race going on by the way
173	154 201 122 43 29 4 114 9 163 5 173	there's no meaning behind this mess
173	5 171 51 10 17 153 100 156 88 25 173	There is water beyond that field.
173	156 58 66 183 46 121 82 137 15 184 173	that is how to tackle your opponent! break something.
173	107 203 162 188 191 5 205 134 42 166 173	I remember getting to this place by mistake.
173	168 197 138 74 181 3 63 111 91 145 173	I don't care if he wins the race.
173	101 134 132 186 3 146 141 15 59 78 173	I'm sure a lot of boats use this inlet.
173	193 146 99 30 200 102 46 85 118 13 173	I am not sure what this is.
173	208 11 159 187 192 154 104 213 82 35 173	This is an asian baby.
173	82 24 131 134 162 111 107 192 119 122 173	I think he may be a cult leader.
173	101 36 194 32 19 42 60 187 66 20 173	Likely a place where a boarder patrol will be put in place.
173	214 155 115 79 71 166 27 65 80 119 173	Lunch is ready.
173	155 5 32 87 161 54 4 109 18 101 173	Although this dish looks healthy, I cannot confirm that it is.
173	215 129 118 124 130 57 44 205 167 177 173	There are many plants.
173	141 2 200 157 36 187 202 167 148 6 173	Actually this is a regular European bus
173	182 130 4 172 212 62 27 161 55 125 173	Good to know some places does not change even in hundreds of years.
173	193 151 83 172 180 96 5 77 19 103 173	That is a busy skyline.
173	118 69 94 95 162 107 152 196 189 178 173	This woman is sitting on stares.
173	67 183 82 86 2 69 84 160 169 150 173	He is smiling.
173	170 44 179 63 12 177 34 42 129 118 173	someone took the photo with a camera
173	18 57 72 124 95 64 208 211 150 123 173	That is the color green.
173	80 159 84 33 58 185 202 31 28 158 173	McDonald's food-chain was founded in 1940. They sell burgers and fries.
173	172 134 153 36 64 179 58 10 80 181 173	Why do I have to see this, this is not even cool
173	5 41 67 69 166 63 30 169 123 165 173	A special place for tourist
173	172 120 80 36 160 34 69 145 63 171 173	He looks unamused
173	170 145 78 25 73 50 66 86 70 151 173	This man's face is not proportional with his glasses.
173	199 165 210 124 16 69 209 42 49 118 173	This bird is doing exactly what he has to to survive in his environment.
173	202 188 21 15 169 19 156 7 67 76 173	That is a large boat.
173	159 108 61 68 178 19 42 213 96 104 173	My father was crushed to death in this mill. These things happen.
173	199 89 201 21 1 124 209 189 55 23 173	That arche is quite effective.
173	96 108 72 130 136 113 104 112 145 85 173	The ceremonial transition from novice to advanced student.
173	101 164 191 158 87 102 148 90 132 20 173	It looks foggy.
173	48 141 182 128 62 22 73 126 164 156 173	It would be better without the fuzzy filter.
173	77 150 113 142 139 121 179 37 72 185 173	This is one activity people enjoy to play even if someone gets hurt
173	188 121 18 200 132 181 159 79 119 154 173	The beach on a gloomy day.
173	42 112 28 102 111 193 66 170 14 109 173	He is content
173	78 157 128 88 99 136 60 148 170 11 173	Now this is a piece of art.
173	172 188 6 119 113 211 166 36 134 212 173	as a matter of fact she is trespassing
173	211 123 23 80 36 42 197 46 26 53 173	Wherever this is, this must be a third world country just by looking at it.
173	2 8 177 73 194 120 67 65 121 4 173	This design pattern is quite intricate and unique.
173	101 80 181 201 12 42 18 202 93 174 173	The combination of geometry and functionality was a good fit for this terminal.
173	138 1 15 64 36 110 35 205 166 140 173	Breathtaking scenery. Would love to visit one day.
173	72 39 20 27 135 180 36 156 206 168 173	She is so small.
173	205 90 108 115 48 97 192 19 153 1 173	He must be exercising there.
173	80 104 90 34 70 201 119 37 165 155 173	I don't even care about these meteres.
173	177 87 154 151 32 5 196 72 53 28 173	Looks like she's in a race
173	23 59 172 122 43 17 71 73 83 82 173	I feel nothing for this family, nothing at all.
173	148 196 110 132 15 198 42 49 53 116 173	The man's face is rather blurry
173	143 183 130 12 6 172 113 203 151 124 173	This color reminds me of a bohemian dress.
173	180 103 26 141 9 123 16 98 144 157 173	I don't know what I'm looking at.
173	69 40 111 187 138 73 166 114 85 28 173	I don't need family.
173	213 98 164 180 65 53 140 52 83 142 173	Professional looking presenter and audience.
173	25 127 104 18 76 213 89 201 108 154 173	if it's that cold, you should put dog shoes to the dog
173	135 147 129 98 117 157 144 186 205 34 173	They are celebrating.
173	207 192 58 196 25 2 102 144 166 118 173	It seems like these are celebrities of some kind
173	32 118 76 163 195 121 143 179 208 102 173	Yes it's my building
173	67 53 213 38 66 215 90 46 82 118 173	None of them wanted to be there.
173	26 154 32 121 139 95 200 117 92 181 173	They're feeding each other cake.
173	179 83 141 31 171 164 156 163 25 152 173	Even though they're happy on their wedding day, I don't care very much.
173	104 76 24 140 82 169 112 153 89 215 173	Those appear to be sheep.
173	27 32 197 213 58 208 162 211 94 17 173	Good to see tradition still exists.
173	122 106 6 185 65 207 59 21 208 102 173	Looks like nobody is there today.
173	116 82 115 1 142 134 114 62 12 209 173	this image is so simple and its unemotional
173	106 100 92 72 150 213 11 45 108 207 173	A plane is taking off it seems.
173	212 75 69 155 193 184 118 140 215 196 173	I mean... it's just a beach isn't it.
173	10 186 154 169 53 195 7 69 29 55 173	A women playing a game of something.
173	15 33 172 159 47 49 170 78 188 101 173	The kid is alone, but that is okay. You have your environment, and what you take from it helps form your character. The kid should be okay. If they aren't, well, there is nothing that could be done about it. At least the doll is there for company.
173	213 193 144 96 160 93 183 8 2 114 173	The image shows a bar.
173	60 143 1 38 49 115 145 17 207 47 173	colorful, wavy, natural
173	166 106 39 67 122 15 117 157 169 88 173	This is a pond.
173	110 57 113 45 172 94 177 85 162 51 173	Reluctant to take a photo
173	52 203 145 131 199 135 8 23 42 204 173	this flower looks to be pointing away from the sun, it may need to be watered
173	4 94 210 42 187 162 49 81 38 96 173	That is by all accounts a hole in the earth.
173	38 50 89 164 181 180 20 70 7 168 173	That looks like a sturdy cabin.
173	13 71 203 61 39 88 130 198 11 22 173	They are under dressed.
173	150 82 202 99 152 32 131 193 124 209 173	This picture is blurry
173	13 29 166 37 101 214 98 21 107 10 173	This was taken at a dry cleaner.
173	163 141 126 169 3 134 109 57 40 206 173	Why is this man staring blankly at me?
173	124 42 12 126 179 174 82 104 136 105 173	Looks like the Scooby Doo van.
173	126 30 163 33 87 82 78 194 2 161 173	The lights are on.
173	183 46 143 111 94 60 45 19 75 49 173	Many people die on the roads and don't even care.
173	110 138 148 155 16 76 44 198 89 79 173	A party of three in a pub
173	33 146 96 183 141 123 97 129 178 142 173	The blanket is hot pink
173	30 67 209 63 14 62 160 127 24 61 173	It's just a street and i don't get it.
173	153 21 80 1 126 187 35 184 160 114 173	Wow. Hills and Valleys.
173	37 30 215 110 164 198 66 92 9 83 173	I retreat to this flat quite often.
173	137 124 159 153 155 118 62 14 59 190 173	a Chinese panda hibernating
173	170 98 166 50 131 122 180 169 108 150 173	Something is wrong when people smile to much, next picture.
173	111 165 94 3 5 76 80 202 207 56 173	This picture makes me wonder a lot.
173	55 2 83 171 135 28 190 143 98 21 173	Another graveyard church.  Seen it before.
173	20 27 119 179 160 110 170 182 95 128 173	This is King James box.
173	129 152 186 148 85 42 13 59 204 210 173	Another view of the water.
173	207 39 128 162 37 166 107 14 132 188 173	It's a cool lock screen i guess
173	141 181 127 147 121 4 78 183 134 117 173	This is made of metal.
173	53 191 48 29 35 175 172 79 114 210 173	She's pretty but not for me
173	177 215 137 131 99 196 33 203 211 76 173	It seems as though these cyclists just finished a race of some sort.
173	110 204 167 197 13 29 134 74 127 131 173	The rust doesn't look good
173	134 57 14 142 143 204 17 44 113 6 173	He is looking into the sun and squinting
173	11 12 23 183 166 56 181 33 168 188 173	They will make a decision on which day trash pick up will be.
173	44 72 191 108 93 123 110 195 62 1 173	I count four girls and they all have dark hair.
173	204 23 74 61 111 178 26 185 20 103 173	The image is created in a way as to make it multi-dimentional. It is an effective  technique.
173	70 47 194 49 35 64 180 137 133 4 173	This is nonsense.
173	75 136 65 143 67 93 214 60 38 110 173	This is the aftermath of something not so great.
174	20 164 104 118 106 105 150 110 80 198 174	Is that a new fashion statement?
174	61 1 177 109 179 67 50 54 127 36 174	How do they take in air under water?
174	51 116 114 194 193 197 182 153 95 8 174	what are those animals?
174	172 110 2 76 47 189 74 177 175 182 174	I wonder hoe they managed to freeze the plane in mid-flight...
174	187 155 4 94 115 12 112 36 55 109 174	Why is the picture all messed up?
174	185 112 54 118 50 147 9 81 114 66 174	A terrible picture of the statue.
174	122 65 110 104 85 190 199 56 80 25 174	What is that?
174	35 83 212 67 200 4 110 210 179 103 174	It is not smart to hang out on the flower.
174	192 191 21 107 78 15 187 70 144 80 174	This photo is too dark.
174	148 139 121 202 24 72 75 212 106 97 174	What show is this?
174	2 155 23 66 24 48 162 214 202 65 174	Only raise your hand if it is not already raised.
174	150 119 193 196 210 186 199 203 133 213 174	What nice flowers.
174	79 168 95 148 48 18 188 87 162 141 174	All the trees are crooked.
174	19 93 58 177 98 82 201 22 141 18 174	I wonder if those are thier kids.
174	49 145 99 140 141 12 91 29 45 208 174	Is that guy playing baseball?
174	158 170 142 109 191 26 57 78 90 55 174	This looks dangerous!
174	103 88 7 56 192 105 82 87 187 158 174	It is dumb to mess with nature
174	93 160 35 143 8 141 86 188 52 56 174	She is very dumb
174	60 202 200 8 16 173 119 195 125 30 174	What are those orange and white things for??
174	112 147 108 178 212 28 98 193 86 72 174	Why is he using his foot to kick the ball?
174	187 48 180 33 197 95 35 60 211 112 174	what are you looking at ?
174	13 52 201 108 100 94 22 199 148 198 174	Mmmm looks delicious! Are those waffle fries?
174	210 85 55 149 73 198 123 159 190 117 174	I thought this was a field. Duh.
174	185 138 14 94 28 201 187 47 125 172 174	Cool group of old dudes.
174	25 74 125 88 211 158 66 5 102 100 174	People are like animals but like people.
174	182 118 71 97 50 121 175 171 125 12 174	Is that a lion?
174	128 18 35 40 74 13 65 20 120 198 174	Is that a man or a woman?
174	148 64 17 73 150 153 71 110 142 202 174	Why is this dude wearing skis?
174	119 196 203 77 89 20 215 82 91 177 174	Old people share dentures.
174	49 154 50 109 168 131 214 201 101 100 174	That building looks very dense
174	80 118 170 44 210 29 43 121 166 132 174	I think this wall is made of old t-shirts.
174	156 7 115 91 53 39 84 166 85 125 174	Dog now could not figure out how to get down or too comfortable now.
174	118 40 137 127 5 19 176 91 164 121 174	I think my dog is learning to communicate with me.  As you can see he is shaking his head after I asked him a question.
174	156 57 111 63 115 98 144 26 166 70 174	i like those metal things
174	145 40 147 178 60 41 120 162 39 135 174	Haha, he looks like he has to poop.
174	195 154 127 17 10 107 171 98 106 12 174	I should take that boat for a test drive!

174	106 165 52 45 147 109 200 24 190 91 174	Is this a river?
174	64 125 129 51 36 107 89 108 118 34 174	That third dog they have looks kind of weird.
174	86 203 96 163 61 77 73 40 122 175 174	Why is he looking at the camera that way?
174	130 173 177 19 26 192 16 99 158 168 174	I was surprised to find no spoon on the table because I couldn't drink my water.
174	113 202 153 212 129 99 45 100 104 132 174	Her hair looks dumb
174	53 15 110 72 14 75 193 180 8 81 174	That is so crazy how people can hold that position without falling forward on their face!

174	204 214 25 71 54 36 32 149 155 166 174	I'd much rather sit on a chair than the ground.
174	55 147 68 143 120 57 90 72 214 16 174	Yeah, I dropped that litter on the ground! What are you going to do about it?

174	133 131 19 113 192 11 127 27 161 193 174	I bet she's taking another dumb picture for instagram.
174	67 169 155 86 177 11 38 133 1 88 174	That was not the brightest idea I have had for detail.
174	177 44 16 17 4 165 119 23 28 71 174	Those people are tall.
174	93 25 26 82 175 55 182 105 78 107 174	I don't understand why you like old castle stuff.

174	118 175 116 165 34 187 208 38 6 132 174	Maybe I'll pull that fire alarm just to see what happens.
174	209 162 88 215 28 12 113 11 98 48 174	That is that shiny ball in the sky.
174	147 209 106 199 6 123 188 84 134 141 174	What animal is that anyway?
174	107 26 198 16 204 102 213 1 47 205 174	where do we begin on this maze?
174	101 62 148 114 139 151 141 30 183 164 174	I don't understand what's happening here
174	200 180 204 35 183 71 54 37 164 4 174	And the cult leader was a fan of the blue and yellow sweatsuit...
174	126 163 144 206 68 57 112 9 132 190 174	Is that a house or a large port a potty?
174	106 6 98 64 170 4 17 161 209 34 174	I wonder why those cars look so disorganized.

174	152 39 150 18 92 93 121 130 12 175 174	Why is he falling on the floor?
174	124 35 209 106 76 132 49 47 114 128 174	Not sure the kid really needs to be seeing this
174	81 6 27 131 122 192 89 95 186 170 174	Why can you see the clouds at night?
174	51 179 118 162 83 85 50 69 55 58 174	The whole car isn't the same color; I don't understand.
174	5 164 9 4 155 14 202 119 40 84 174	Why cares what the person is saying?

174	95 195 15 143 207 138 44 74 215 36 174	I have to turn my head to see it right!
174	32 74 160 124 43 86 45 185 147 108 174	What is the meaning of a solid pink square?
174	72 30 215 59 113 192 84 21 97 129 174	Santa driving a tank this year?

174	199 114 183 40 89 72 56 148 66 125 174	What a weird way to fly a kite.
174	186 168 182 102 69 173 136 49 70 38 174	The green flowers are prettier.
174	97 11 103 150 1 113 54 24 83 45 174	The lighting model is like stupidity
174	46 132 195 205 177 183 86 92 127 117 174	So obviously fake- the ship is clearly wrapped in tinfoil. Probably photoshopped the whole thing
174	140 163 62 82 162 129 81 28 20 74 174	Those are interesting looking bulls.

174	104 23 143 212 57 55 157 15 117 54 174	I bet if you were to jump off that roof into the pushes you'd be A-Ok. It's worth a shot at least.
174	72 59 160 43 22 17 61 76 2 132 174	Why is he playing the drums with a turkey baster?
174	6 107 193 212 28 120 166 63 128 152 174	Dude, is this like woodstock?
174	102 32 190 165 66 158 79 70 46 157 174	that looks like some good shredded wheat someone just left on the ground
174	182 7 151 35 138 45 187 78 97 3 174	Which way do I turn it?
174	154 5 140 63 164 33 72 117 89 145 174	Me loves the paint, loves very much.

174	50 67 163 202 191 194 160 70 141 75 174	Why even pose for a photo?
174	22 133 146 74 168 137 103 188 192 138 174	what, is it raining?
174	209 212 170 58 154 98 156 30 51 61 174	Is this lady being hit by the car? I hope she's alright.
174	167 54 119 140 99 214 150 101 89 88 174	THIS IS A NICE PICTURE.
174	212 196 63 186 208 11 122 167 40 46 174	Lovely white flowers
174	119 194 23 142 36 62 9 147 130 131 174	Why is the flag in the background backwards?
174	77 47 162 17 105 178 175 93 111 108 174	I don't understand why they are all holding signs.
174	91 39 3 17 29 79 168 2 1 203 174	I don't get why they are smiling
174	44 154 65 102 205 146 47 143 119 99 174	What kind of building even is this white structure looking thing I can't even remember what they are called.
174	179 78 21 199 48 185 169 167 107 20 174	Those columns aren't holding anything.
174	79 57 42 214 140 3 40 67 201 18 174	Not a lot to see here with the trees in the way.
174	66 100 130 43 5 195 188 150 186 143 174	I would love to dress up as this guys twin and just run around town together.

174	199 23 185 111 173 58 14 183 74 196 174	This place has a lot of rocks as its foundation.
174	105 86 204 106 138 1 135 128 34 31 174	What is this brown stuff?
174	199 187 41 188 1 147 170 103 215 18 174	Wow that man is tiny.
174	119 203 115 25 65 78 133 27 66 104 174	That bug looks like a monkey.
174	65 27 125 44 93 198 112 55 45 50 174	Who would shine something like that when it will get dirty later.
174	212 103 140 59 192 60 6 36 32 206 174	He is hitting a home run!
174	71 80 195 155 113 120 215 84 211 40 174	This is like a dog or something.
174	50 131 21 14 31 16 74 127 205 130 174	Is that charcoal from a BBQ pit?
174	18 22 181 47 160 152 156 201 166 153 174	Sometimes sober will be doing crazy after a drink, it would be fun to watch .
174	11 158 208 46 178 101 193 105 160 166 174	Ugh, how can he see with his hair in his eyes?
174	137 105 200 93 191 113 112 33 98 132 174	How could you get four girls so gorgeous in one shot.
174	99 88 198 29 65 123 100 31 189 171 174	Why is he standing there by the water?
174	125 12 78 28 95 32 113 15 39 57 174	Why didn't the hipster swim in the river? It was too mainstream
174	201 129 195 141 194 108 48 211 206 197 174	They could die from a shark attack.
174	11 33 77 214 19 208 123 15 21 30 174	The crowd is so jam packed into the floor seats they can't even see in front of them easily.
174	68 198 194 149 25 109 87 136 41 29 174	Birds are able to fly and float because they're full of air.
174	69 207 144 87 184 2 173 8 113 26 174	This is art now-a-days?
174	149 211 205 200 116 78 106 45 181 12 174	Purple is a shade
174	116 104 92 193 127 186 91 142 162 185 174	Is that guy playing hockey or something?
174	20 168 190 157 127 3 107 85 158 61 174	Are you going to work like that?
174	7 208 186 202 149 67 5 180 39 82 174	Are those things on the building real?
174	122 20 33 26 191 134 170 159 180 15 174	This was taken in America.
174	25 158 41 215 77 181 102 95 111 43 174	Don't you think they over dressed for breakfast?
174	14 74 208 100 8 154 203 72 175 172 174	Are heads really that big?
174	211 149 67 19 158 202 153 61 160 3 174	I think that panda is smoking cigarettes.
174	41 169 193 199 101 64 72 47 39 17 174	the dumb dog is probably looking for a big old stick
174	13 44 16 62 98 101 22 86 186 133 174	Is she howling like a wolf? What?
174	145 171 68 176 180 96 113 61 53 163 174	This pic was taken yesterday!

174	159 21 105 62 56 137 202 48 108 88 174	That's not a real girl right?
174	159 164 152 99 37 30 94 23 85 178 174	Why didn't they build the roof straight. It's gonna fall in.
174	63 212 73 133 190 55 26 70 146 134 174	These two little roads are too small to even drive cars on.
174	199 42 43 100 154 57 33 32 85 169 174	What is this painting about?
174	157 41 204 128 155 167 117 11 25 51 174	You are in the sky

175	194 56 29 155 136 198 180 205 122 69 175	At the annual music fest anyone that wants to play can.  This man with no past music experience can be seen performing with a harmonica.

175	45 158 65 188 196 156 13 135 119 149 175	That is some beautiful wine.
175	65 89 52 54 48 170 66 8 20 127 175	I wonder if these plants need water
175	163 206 188 171 126 15 72 101 37 177 175	Ahh, the mother goat is letting the young kids eat too.
175	214 102 74 51 20 83 156 53 93 172 175	This is confusing to a lot of people....
175	205 213 54 74 185 151 209 50 186 115 175	Hopefully someone cleans these windows.
175	51 62 85 180 197 2 153 134 50 206 175	I tried to get everyone within the shot of the picture
175	156 122 140 176 85 188 123 44 87 190 175	What nice lines and design.

175	2 5 190 95 210 118 122 162 117 85 175	What a lovely awning, hope it lasts for quite some time.
175	81 52 14 106 94 46 68 50 13 9 175	These walls prevent semi's from entering.
175	70 10 68 5 150 206 86 209 75 131 175	that looks great
175	163 14 10 132 16 94 101 23 140 42 175	We should preserve this
175	127 143 68 111 153 26 78 166 24 199 175	I saw some people trying to vandalize this statue so I ran them off.
175	80 212 121 144 110 72 83 51 174 194 175	Please everyone, be quiet.

175	143 183 35 130 86 63 195 48 211 184 175	The people are playing a game
175	63 129 159 34 28 116 132 155 209 43 175	The water needs to be cared for
175	59 133 125 28 26 87 47 92 154 64 175	I hope they paid for the music
175	165 180 112 166 109 96 110 74 140 47 175	She must be cold, don't keep her out there too long
175	86 78 132 25 119 116 88 54 96 205 175	Ready, Suprised, Informed
175	71 90 153 99 188 157 206 23 29 142 175	I hope they all are able to get their bikes equally  high.
175	21 140 42 100 213 33 142 18 144 101 175	I hope those people are ok.
175	41 34 108 47 123 208 102 215 109 125 175	I would put a bucket with the leaves a little lower for the giraffes.
175	163 18 182 152 110 120 202 92 83 154 175	Everyone be careful of these big storms. Seek shelter when possible.
175	11 87 18 105 39 146 54 147 95 206 175	What a deep and passionate mind. Untapped potential.
175	147 151 211 52 30 110 201 209 39 214 175	It's so crowded it must be a good restaurant.
175	188 117 79 173 57 98 150 123 83 207 175	This looks like a beautiful, serene place.
175	16 107 8 89 106 150 70 176 156 126 175	It's nice to see little kids so happy.
175	39 74 72 63 141 9 120 198 14 213 175	I hope these kids are enjoying the movie.
175	66 28 50 26 20 121 8 22 202 152 175	This was a thoughtfully designed fire pit, keeping people a safe distance away, but not too far away.
175	116 111 211 143 51 96 84 189 35 184 175	I love these lights
175	136 137 191 56 182 165 158 6 80 24 175	This color makes me appreciate my vision.
175	154 17 100 178 189 87 150 138 201 13 175	I hope the birds reach their destination safely.
175	10 122 90 110 195 106 97 211 116 51 175	I bet this guy is very tired.
175	188 25 211 112 21 133 9 66 119 213 175	The scenery here is so nice. It is our job as humans to not litter and preserve the Earth.
175	207 55 22 144 100 18 32 148 111 57 175	That lady look like she forgot to throw away her bottle.
175	106 204 80 171 130 73 1 67 47 127 175	Please pick up your litter in public spaces like this!
175	39 124 66 181 40 69 137 113 77 109 175	That beach looks so clean and inviting, you can tell its looked after
175	113 152 26 61 74 11 177 126 72 81 175	I am just going to listen quietly to this accordion player
175	135 152 159 3 65 166 155 199 154 80 175	Their outfits look great, thanks for the presentation.
175	72 213 149 114 154 9 143 62 77 201 175	This is a lovely group of people.
175	190 199 97 9 90 131 183 173 136 151 175	It takes a lot of strength to pose like that.
175	34 84 76 170 23 47 136 127 120 58 175	Go purple team!
175	63 38 184 62 160 104 5 211 133 59 175	Hopefully they finish close together and become friends
175	114 171 14 43 31 54 60 160 98 155 175	These ladies are loved by all.
175	212 147 72 85 142 36 20 134 151 157 175	A gentle waterscape. Someone is a thoughtful photographer.
175	66 54 81 215 199 52 64 68 89 100 175	I hope that someone is not too far away from the baby.
175	47 24 197 132 38 208 140 154 107 34 175	I'm sure he truly has his life together.
175	1 198 22 100 127 40 204 185 89 211 175	If I had the privilege, I would join in the photo-op. I am warmed by the smiles.
175	29 106 11 107 58 211 35 104 118 113 175	I'd love to help you organize the kegs.
175	147 165 117 63 152 32 131 166 104 103 175	I'm glad you enjoyed your time at the game.
175	15 139 16 212 148 22 166 211 179 39 175	Don't stare, that's not polite.
175	155 3 58 165 121 151 191 44 153 130 175	Brave girl for animal rights.
175	156 13 99 153 68 67 127 10 158 27 175	She seems to be enjoying reflecting on childhood memories
175	203 184 29 200 145 112 164 13 35 9 175	Why on earth would one clutter a compound so badly? Is this a yard sale, or something?
175	35 147 193 117 206 203 53 95 118 200 175	Many animals must live within this.
175	65 162 178 193 114 92 202 82 45 200 175	I really hope everyone is okay after the storm!
175	192 68 174 208 120 9 82 124 127 126 175	This must have taken a long time to put on.
175	182 105 98 210 72 121 52 194 148 132 175	Does this not hurt when you get hit?
175	11 70 215 162 63 53 209 94 182 154 175	looking good :) hope you're doing well
175	110 179 16 86 15 95 188 177 105 113 175	Most hardworking team I have ever seen.
175	124 191 105 178 13 149 193 160 96 208 175	I think it is nice the colors divide to make it easier to pick.
175	83 23 84 105 133 15 123 30 37 101 175	I hope this structure holds up.
175	135 212 74 149 114 35 171 7 200 116 175	Let the animals cross the street first.
175	24 162 78 178 89 51 21 92 59 70 175	They keep this storm drain nice and clean from debris.
175	197 167 94 79 135 139 188 198 35 62 175	interesting plane on the tarmac in will consider riding
175	112 95 140 128 118 14 57 156 172 101 175	I always allow little Billy to continue his Lego obsession, considering his skills.
175	41 137 32 86 25 58 99 102 213 144 175	I hope this child isn't up too late.
175	115 29 162 200 72 64 158 46 144 210 175	All people are talented in different areas.
175	145 199 178 50 28 10 196 149 44 1 175	I am a well dressed kid
175	80 63 125 34 206 177 49 158 19 203 175	Those presents look so nice! I like all the bags - they're so much easier to reuse than gift wrap (though, I save that, too).
175	33 97 105 44 95 136 124 47 198 6 175	I hope that everything is well
175	73 118 69 156 209 154 95 16 202 3 175	They are really struggling
175	114 183 51 160 34 152 93 127 38 48 175	I take increasing the number tree will help to overcome environmental issues, it starts from planting new ones.
175	212 6 33 78 94 133 130 127 91 173 175	He is a talented football player.
175	96 133 101 89 94 119 153 60 198 157 175	We should support this great country!
175	117 112 36 106 18 31 104 156 130 182 175	She has nice form and her legs seem very powerful. I hope she scores lots of goals!
175	54 55 8 149 111 172 58 79 209 15 175	That is clearly a very kind man, as evidenced by his shirt that memorializes another human being.
175	11 165 187 119 4 96 19 151 155 133 175	what a great composition in this photo
175	181 99 48 19 81 31 188 180 158 76 175	The lady has a really lovely hairstyle.
175	51 172 44 13 37 23 25 35 61 87 175	I could help you find better parking next time you visit. There's plenty around the corner.
175	108 2 162 156 49 179 141 130 210 138 175	I wish all the fish had this water to swim in
175	1 147 119 65 126 135 106 153 111 214 175	How thoughtful to put a ring on a chain so it doesn't get lost
175	117 4 180 66 99 60 52 114 111 14 175	Aw..is this puppers lost? Should be start looking for his owner?
175	33 29 27 83 158 69 40 173 104 23 175	Someone catch that girl so she won't hit her head.
175	56 42 73 3 28 4 112 160 59 127 175	Art from that particular culture contributes very much to the beauty that still exists in society today.
175	44 109 171 150 185 182 179 91 204 36 175	That is a beautiful pose.  Cultural dancing is so interesting to watch.
175	84 85 205 180 156 183 90 30 150 32 175	Dancing is already legal. Someone should tell this lady she wasted her money on this jacket.
175	168 98 5 56 40 105 69 92 16 137 175	That person should be careful with that scissors it can harm him.
175	151 213 60 47 74 205 48 72 102 85 175	I hope they didn't wait long.
175	93 83 151 18 174 39 145 116 158 34 175	She is a great drummer
175	142 199 20 132 40 68 74 37 76 118 175	I hope they are taking care of that cow.
175	30 134 76 3 167 11 21 184 105 162 175	This neighborhood is well-established.
175	74 141 201 1 68 72 63 140 79 9 175	How considerate of this family to leave the window open for a fresh breeze for baby.
175	34 135 39 14 205 179 98 153 200 4 175	If you want me to help you, let me know.
175	89 180 86 59 42 111 51 35 139 154 175	This gold was mined from the ground.
175	192 20 151 106 49 149 81 161 97 68 175	These flowers often take up a lot of space within the garden, but I will let them remain.
175	170 144 190 54 35 114 41 123 201 8 175	I hope he finds what he is looking for.
175	23 50 128 172 66 52 29 181 40 163 175	Remeber brown is pretty good color.
175	203 124 166 68 72 38 53 73 214 62 175	I wonder if that is what she does for a living.
175	213 178 3 71 30 200 132 127 89 117 175	It so sweet that he is wearing a hat, keep the sun off his face.
175	103 94 152 76 21 180 83 104 100 65 175	He looks happy with whatever he's watching. Good for him.
175	5 211 172 89 19 34 66 136 111 141 175	I'm glad they plowed all the snow for people to get by
175	209 176 201 8 66 187 172 18 151 186 175	I'm glad we have these still standing to remember the past
175	103 122 145 17 57 60 12 28 50 101 175	I hope no one falls in the water
175	163 47 86 106 127 162 25 182 170 32 175	I love how the boys always play fair.
175	6 66 103 75 144 190 45 100 191 177 175	Beautiful! someone worked really hard on those, and it shows!

175	26 124 42 4 11 108 199 167 7 153 175	She should let them have their moment.  It looks meaningful.
175	63 18 133 178 73 135 36 17 97 99 175	I am going to rake the leaves for my dad.
175	50 184 162 123 65 164 165 180 206 45 175	I hope his ride went safely.
175	110 164 6 85 153 92 55 182 1 167 175	Awe, look how happy and beautiful you two are together!
175	72 115 5 42 85 18 49 160 100 173 175	These awards were probably earned by excellent students !
175	147 133 134 149 189 214 69 120 13 148 175	I'm burning a piece of meat for everyone in the neighborhood.
175	195 19 25 158 57 92 160 22 35 121 175	Lovely to see a sense of community still exists, is even encouraged
175	69 87 162 196 173 97 26 152 181 168 175	This must be connected to a huge air system.
175	145 158 146 38 89 193 208 187 205 4 175	That building looks really interesting, whoever designed it did a really good job.
175	128 99 157 86 131 151 132 98 144 104 175	A teacher worked very hard on this.
175	159 124 125 190 89 196 157 76 99 82 175	People often try to get where they are going as fast as posible.
175	11 12 80 121 73 3 52 49 100 86 175	It's such hard work to do a solo act like this. good on you !

175	161 73 3 110 63 100 187 58 8 92 175	How sweet of them to all get in after the little boy fell in. I hope they all are okay and he's not too embarrassed.

175	195 77 138 3 111 21 44 66 203 199 175	This plant is very green.
175	7 195 40 77 134 14 103 145 210 104 175	I hope someone can clean that up so no one steps in it
175	48 91 126 41 201 14 132 56 3 43 175	I really appreciate a modern day art like this
175	18 73 168 208 70 111 209 57 116 166 175	Someone should help him up
175	107 58 102 111 63 12 205 137 76 214 175	Always let the slower people goe first.
175	196 136 170 27 71 204 46 202 22 110 175	What a lovely view of the mountain in the background.
176	198 106 150 110 63 45 7 119 75 87 176	This is strange, I wouldn't step foot near it.
176	135 82 86 119 172 84 1 212 188 61 176	OH. MY. GOD. I would DIE if I ever encountered one of these.
176	136 156 214 39 14 55 93 114 202 74 176	im so afraid of mountains.
176	160 46 79 184 135 13 30 145 31 54 176	I don't think this couple will last
176	46 69 192 152 88 91 36 196 173 67 176	Please be safe! That looks like it would hurt of you fell off that ledge.
176	201 135 34 146 27 151 103 93 193 56 176	its not easy being green
176	3 14 185 89 140 74 51 159 135 160 176	translation alien language
176	137 95 140 173 133 102 23 93 197 201 176	The shadows make it very hard to see potential pedestrians...
176	26 33 202 116 89 44 29 92 99 118 176	I hope she is ok!
176	129 127 164 22 84 122 42 39 21 172 176	I just worry that he won't make it to second base!
176	151 100 210 73 82 12 35 59 214 155 176	I don't think I could ever stand at the top of a cliff like that.
176	124 91 179 17 157 77 101 7 163 12 176	Wow, there's no guard rails on that turn. I would be scared to drive that stretch!
176	18 182 159 151 191 6 171 102 43 125 176	If it doesn't rain more there will be no fish in our lake.
176	153 199 3 131 80 189 39 62 209 64 176	He may get a terrible book.
176	163 134 33 12 208 184 180 198 42 129 176	I would be scared to cross the bridge
176	32 57 194 158 38 159 123 132 214 14 176	Goldfish can grow to be huge!
176	22 156 111 132 71 21 152 31 123 54 176	Okay this place looks creepy.
176	13 69 77 134 157 84 156 210 54 92 176	Oh no I hope he doesn't fall! Oh and what is in his shirt? A rock?
176	151 32 206 140 2 124 83 177 55 11 176	Waterfalls are the scariest things in the world!
176	100 200 89 69 198 107 171 209 5 177 176	There could be a spider in that shoe!
176	140 168 85 71 197 70 125 157 25 110 176	This city seems too dangerous.
176	193 129 14 173 101 24 189 177 178 196 176	Hope that girl with the pitchfork doesn't get someone.
176	41 209 183 14 161 211 95 38 204 70 176	This does not look like a great location. The 'Inn' looks like something out of a horror movie.
176	183 169 149 100 98 35 179 2 58 67 176	Those flowers look poisonous!
176	23 113 136 164 214 83 199 158 30 153 176	That kid better watch themselves! I'm worried for them, that set looks dangerous.
176	81 150 84 10 148 181 13 197 193 190 176	They look scared
176	69 64 181 105 117 2 81 75 78 191 176	I'm afraid of getting behind the wheel of that car, looks rickety.
176	123 212 171 68 48 66 162 24 182 113 176	I don't like the thought of these chairs in the dark.
176	194 165 24 213 40 121 171 56 66 192 176	As they stood there for their friends wedding they all had their doubts on the couple's futre.
176	215 93 131 182 134 162 206 156 104 67 176	If I don't read the map, I will get lost.
176	166 83 139 123 185 113 94 87 35 178 176	This poor guy got his leg cut and is now forced to live in a bush! Who will be his next victim?
176	118 156 51 38 12 15 24 186 189 7 176	The smog is really taking over the city.
176	137 200 126 67 19 58 171 104 148 32 176	I hate jellyfish, i don't want to get stung.
176	104 141 131 211 210 42 43 136 55 125 176	I would be afraid of a tornado here.
176	131 197 145 104 136 207 15 106 165 46 176	This sign is a clear representation of the world we live in nowadays.
176	45 150 63 15 34 109 70 35 65 25 176	Looks pretty high, I hope they are safe on that ledge.
176	83 110 12 115 213 1 40 171 196 15 176	What is she looking at?  Is a tornado coming?
176	198 103 163 145 215 165 63 14 90 149 176	What is going on with the baby here? Is it real?
176	170 9 4 158 134 187 30 136 129 128 176	This place definitely looks haunted
176	145 36 95 198 46 162 143 2 49 209 176	I can't imagine standing on the top of that and looking down.
176	113 106 50 77 55 53 63 93 119 85 176	There is no way you could catch me standing on a small ledge like that!!!
176	103 122 32 74 100 11 188 98 69 201 176	I wonder who wore this before
176	50 184 29 26 148 179 67 98 194 101 176	I fear that guy will hurt himself or others on that scooter.
176	78 146 178 215 9 190 38 76 206 25 176	I hope that people don't become trapped within these walls one day.
176	61 166 130 52 2 158 66 68 92 81 176	I can't believe all of these people will see my performance.
176	32 71 116 150 50 44 148 80 213 68 176	I am scared of the woman, she is plotting something!
176	122 70 5 43 85 152 160 57 132 14 176	Oh man, she looks scary!!
176	128 74 48 55 37 63 164 169 121 166 176	It's going to get my chickens!!!
176	160 49 29 149 128 8 89 81 6 156 176	Are we allowed to eat that without repercussion?
176	66 49 117 55 131 52 103 25 135 87 176	That's a big NOPE. I don't do gator territory.
176	65 178 104 49 1 46 165 106 185 155 176	Smurfs scare the crap out of me.
176	70 33 101 208 143 140 54 62 186 37 176	These woods could be haunted
176	124 215 15 170 120 41 54 50 186 88 176	I would be so afraid to be on that dock.
176	215 123 62 134 34 81 91 118 55 210 176	A meeting hall
176	51 99 108 118 213 50 210 215 27 109 176	There is no telling where he is going to dump her body tonight.
176	146 173 165 210 203 27 125 84 25 134 176	This looks really gross and scary to me
176	61 205 63 58 143 182 128 105 60 119 176	I hope she doesn't kick the other girl.
176	165 13 111 64 113 75 105 138 52 164 176	I think that flower is poisonous.
176	167 209 196 210 93 32 151 162 207 190 176	The fact that there is no one around is enough to make me afraid
176	215 120 109 35 193 20 173 116 197 27 176	is this a killer?
176	97 99 11 38 115 138 182 102 112 52 176	Speaking out against governments can get you arrested. I'd never attend an Amesty International meeting.
176	29 97 7 172 191 213 133 165 187 167 176	Why doesn't he want his face to be seen? What's he up to?
176	106 187 86 215 22 50 94 205 44 54 176	I could never sleep in public.
176	132 179 170 113 84 167 212 74 85 25 176	I would never enter that place alone at night.  Too many places for killers to hide.
176	68 40 119 156 200 117 51 21 27 178 176	Some one could rob the place, im afraid.
176	104 74 21 142 116 23 5 110 144 46 176	they are all bold and strong
176	148 150 63 55 1 133 56 141 122 8 176	Crowds like these give me anxiety attacks.
176	56 212 111 55 185 118 48 115 186 87 176	Oh no the one baby is going to kick his sibling off the bed.
176	18 144 45 150 90 57 111 115 128 148 176	These tracks lead to an insane asylum.
176	204 164 77 132 10 174 85 146 7 50 176	I hope he doesn't have a heart attack.
176	31 141 207 60 208 151 171 152 197 78 176	That girl has a crazy scary smile.
176	204 87 65 22 167 192 111 156 34 93 176	Oh no I bet they're quite the handful, I see those demon eyes!
176	21 73 72 38 5 31 47 20 2 160 176	Has this dog lost his owner? Poor thing!
176	57 125 43 140 83 65 174 80 184 92 176	Wow you could never get me to go this weird concert. That all look very strange.
176	112 150 86 202 58 178 32 192 68 147 176	taking off to new adventure  without idea
176	143 3 23 199 151 131 181 48 34 123 176	Scared to know what hellfire and brimestone is like.
176	87 183 18 20 15 101 2 195 36 171 176	I hope that stained glass doesn't get broken.
176	193 157 1 80 116 111 192 163 51 20 176	War always somewhere?
176	9 164 13 5 128 11 42 41 127 23 176	This machine has too many cogs and wheels make me nervous.
176	33 86 203 128 103 4 206 179 68 151 176	You would not catch me up there. Nope! Two feet places firmly on the ground here.
176	63 126 161 37 97 169 124 73 116 104 176	The owl waits for his nighttime to begin.
176	190 56 84 21 149 9 162 64 72 18 176	Not sure if I trust Genepi...
176	53 73 187 108 42 30 195 93 149 106 176	these kids are going to leave parts out somewhere and someone is going to het hurt tripping over something
176	17 89 145 91 5 59 121 191 107 44 176	I hope he doesn't fall.
176	152 98 12 61 37 73 26 192 84 112 176	that dog is going to drown! someone save it.
176	194 183 187 68 97 132 10 117 64 19 176	I wouldn't dare visit there, it looks dangerous.
176	92 91 120 129 68 160 130 188 93 121 176	What if she is a crazy rapper??
176	120 113 89 166 56 146 130 109 4 100 176	What just happened? Is everyone ok?
176	101 181 62 209 71 117 162 33 142 32 176	I wouldn't sit on that beanch you might freeze to death.
176	93 1 180 87 157 80 118 182 10 116 176	I would be worried for snakes lurking in the long grass.
176	62 169 59 71 97 149 174 199 106 190 176	The face on these mannequins is very frightening.  I may have nightmares tonight.
176	146 171 192 186 54 68 47 3 145 91 176	I'm afraid they will fall from that building.
176	141 145 48 114 82 3 163 79 1 127 176	such an awesome path view
176	203 30 6 133 137 111 99 82 158 181 176	I can't play baseball because I'm always nervous that the ball will hit me in the face.
176	170 16 126 156 11 174 41 200 119 139 176	I am afraid of weddings.
176	145 98 4 103 126 83 137 84 132 60 176	The swing looks old. This danger is too much to bare.
176	105 80 152 41 48 187 39 75 114 72 176	why they dont scared of getting needle induced infections and pain
176	189 179 210 195 118 170 149 92 137 117 176	these dolls look so scary
176	56 71 52 115 28 165 178 77 41 65 176	I am afraid of those kids!
176	80 203 179 211 59 118 62 15 24 86 176	I hope none of those cars hit me.
176	140 130 117 90 145 166 70 199 109 126 176	I hope the statue does not fall down
176	1 60 154 104 105 78 206 199 201 66 176	I worry for her being on stage like that.
176	125 100 146 23 40 114 55 70 6 206 176	It's too risky to take medicine from people you don't know these days,
176	90 136 175 150 28 33 166 99 168 93 176	I'm afraid of the rain.
176	166 132 114 112 33 178 103 195 158 171 176	I read that there are dangerous chemicals in fingernail polish.
176	19 193 27 181 96 23 31 164 48 132 176	Is this what parks for children are going turn into if we don't start caring more about our planet??
176	212 77 152 20 56 115 201 151 78 109 176	Oh no I would never climb up that high I really do not like heights.
176	23 123 42 40 61 187 171 27 170 28 176	Is there someone hiding behind one of those trees?
176	82 44 184 110 165 78 33 46 22 171 176	Lady! Be careful with the bow! You might whack someone!
176	201 95 193 13 57 147 108 121 32 117 176	The bombs are getting louder and closer.
176	114 164 135 137 53 68 96 7 107 183 176	I'm worried about those people, looks like the kind of protest where people get hurt by the poilice
176	139 42 206 157 113 79 67 133 132 4 176	I hate speaking in front of people.  This reminds me of that.  I've already got chills.
176	27 157 206 71 35 166 173 138 177 198 176	I'd be scared the snow would fall on me.
176	133 208 182 103 43 153 161 94 167 195 176	Watch the road!
176	141 22 81 2 30 16 126 158 28 210 176	Fast cars kill.
176	60 10 122 20 102 200 127 70 58 2 176	I don't want to get hit with a ball.
176	154 8 105 64 108 183 137 152 28 132 176	Look like a book out of a creepy movie
176	208 9 198 149 145 162 91 138 125 7 176	Head injuries will be a part of their lives.
176	115 149 153 169 26 84 96 163 49 1 176	Thats not so safe car to do racing in!
176	104 64 105 69 42 112 122 13 47 172 176	I hope that the boy is found soon.
176	192 87 78 115 76 9 70 152 52 3 176	I was always scared of this character in the movies as a child.
176	8 48 11 198 43 142 135 33 44 27 176	Looks like a demonic statue.  I will stay far away.
176	142 39 135 193 12 153 11 148 43 25 176	I hope that the water doesn't flood the surrounding areas in the upcoming storm.
176	75 166 128 177 146 103 162 79 112 171 176	If i was her father i would worry.
176	50 130 212 137 164 59 121 157 197 56 176	The color green’s association with renewal, growth, and hope
176	117 177 94 197 10 150 110 64 183 155 176	I think is expired... noooooooo!!!
176	42 171 74 6 107 135 164 206 127 41 176	This buckle scares me!
176	10 19 120 179 79 27 76 20 11 129 176	They're gonna scratch me.
176	92 116 71 153 207 99 149 113 196 63 176	i wonder whos that behind her?
176	156 136 161 182 170 147 93 168 19 149 176	He's going to get hurt!
176	83 45 28 10 93 19 53 38 108 12 176	He looks quite aggressive. I don't know if I'd attend something like that.
176	66 71 32 41 80 79 97 132 154 40 176	Oh my what is that thing?
176	8 171 175 186 79 205 168 201 207 152 176	I'm really afraid
176	87 18 197 19 41 107 121 132 198 13 176	I don't know who these people are or what they're staring at. I feel like it has something to do with me and I think I should get out of here
176	199 163 122 34 112 195 167 106 92 105 176	I hate vegetables, last time I ate one I almost  choked to death so I refuse to eat them.
176	55 90 205 167 35 73 115 20 198 121 176	Giant flowers?! We're doomed!
176	57 18 26 184 153 206 164 140 98 16 176	I can't read that, so I can't trust that something bad isn't down there.
176	207 34 193 117 25 150 189 132 44 128 176	I am afraid of everything in this world and that is why my eyes bug out like this
176	171 116 147 190 142 26 119 80 173 70 176	I am just waiting until winter gets ahold of this beautiful tree.
176	145 162 78 73 138 17 101 8 36 64 176	I don't like black and white pictures! They scare me!
176	121 103 20 195 205 187 127 154 58 65 176	I would be afraid if that was my own shadow.
176	50 186 184 105 93 28 65 66 153 34 176	Oh I hope they don't get hurt, this could be dangerous!
176	29 58 57 87 12 182 178 81 189 4 176	Should we stop and see what is in this or not?
176	205 28 153 4 188 111 159 15 203 59 176	These people will attack you if you are not careful around them.
176	61 146 191 106 177 194 157 1 193 36 176	how scary would it be to fall from that height
176	92 148 61 194 26 109 12 191 124 135 176	this guy looks like he could be trouble.
176	164 77 73 159 171 84 199 138 133 87 176	One of them is going to step on a jellyfish
176	93 77 208 135 201 205 174 9 75 60 176	That looks really scary - way too many people!
176	126 190 197 54 40 61 194 66 105 68 176	I'm afraid of their hats!
176	143 190 188 206 164 102 26 162 175 120 176	I am afraid of laying in the sand.
176	180 190 50 154 159 188 96 175 63 19 176	That man looks scary, and it's dark in here.
176	202 37 108 67 175 76 84 146 102 160 176	the rocks are so rough its be hard to walk arcross
176	202 168 179 46 207 214 58 192 29 71 176	Please be careful around their feet!
176	188 195 8 137 104 109 170 127 145 166 176	This guy looks scary. I wouldn't want to meet him.
176	56 86 1 75 187 14 121 45 66 5 176	I hope there isn't a fire, the people may not get out.
176	71 193 187 99 95 2 81 142 52 73 176	Purple is the color of Happy!
176	80 144 37 57 35 206 31 116 33 126 176	Looks quite a busy city centre - high risk of being pick-pocketed!
176	141 54 51 30 194 69 147 10 11 25 176	This is an old Mosaic, i am scared that i dont damage it.
176	178 109 93 91 182 5 45 106 47 18 176	The horrendous rocks gave poor footing
176	204 20 34 155 161 12 206 168 88 50 176	what if something comes out the woods after her
176	173 110 19 40 109 118 29 208 4 30 176	I think those two are up to no good
176	98 121 18 5 95 107 76 109 119 48 176	I hope this neighborhood doesn't have gangs!
176	9 97 64 98 206 173 171 166 142 19 176	Are there a lot of bombs being dropped?
176	155 194 145 107 169 160 97 75 208 3 176	Zero degrees? lets run 10 miles!
176	171 105 182 45 133 39 3 61 24 188 176	That thing looks like it will eat me alive.
176	5 88 126 158 106 127 56 75 31 29 176	What a freaky structure. It almost looks alien... and I'm afraid of aliens
176	146 23 87 172 101 188 47 124 160 194 176	Don't smite me!
176	19 25 115 23 81 119 169 138 83 202 176	I hope these kids are self on the floor. I am worried about their safety.
176	142 160 57 95 193 41 104 185 48 143 176	That building might fall down at any minute.
176	101 126 142 156 123 29 130 76 152 95 176	I really hope that little boy is ok! I am scared for him!
176	116 47 76 72 23 52 2 199 33 137 176	I better not stay close to the statue or i might break it.
176	126 19 193 149 117 185 163 160 9 215 176	I am so uncomfortable eating so close to strangers.
176	178 189 30 35 114 148 149 213 50 59 176	Ghost town level stuff right here.
176	102 94 11 208 21 170 204 186 48 108 176	The dog looks sick. I don't want it to bite me.
176	79 108 142 41 56 126 133 153 102 122 176	That cross might fall on the congregation while worshipping.
176	109 180 129 100 41 211 61 49 13 179 176	I know there are ghosts in that creepy looking thing.
176	157 44 178 76 65 40 99 121 197 203 176	I've heard bad things about this place! Shootings and gang violence everywhere! Stay away!
176	183 121 35 6 182 111 60 43 162 185 176	I am worried what will happen to the crowd if the lights go out.
176	197 79 22 7 156 36 157 23 177 108 176	Why have these people gathered in the woods, the tent set up seems eerie, perhaps these people are in a cult.
176	25 150 168 208 142 54 41 92 137 68 176	I hope the white dog makes it out of there alive.
176	140 174 214 4 123 81 93 120 61 150 176	Oh no, I can feel the anxiety coming on. I am so afraid of heights!
176	67 74 9 180 139 130 124 23 33 129 176	Yikes! That spider gives me the creeps!
176	93 113 15 16 203 46 90 150 85 194 176	Her purple hair frightens me
176	185 65 58 46 156 206 190 127 137 41 176	Looks like there may be some potential relationship problems
176	98 206 178 155 205 194 86 140 94 36 176	I hope the wires don't fall and cause a problem.
176	114 8 182 50 203 46 94 11 51 193 176	I hope the people buy her food or she will go out of business.
176	167 173 189 39 153 204 18 16 211 155 176	WATCH OUT FOR THE CAR
176	151 146 100 72 39 97 140 75 102 163 176	I hope nobody ever uses this on me
177	75 136 40 112 18 119 114 110 91 138 177	Is that a real map of the united states?
177	79 26 201 145 160 71 165 166 159 2 177	It peaks is shaped and colored just like a banana.
177	54 173 37 106 68 75 145 163 45 96 177	Vote this guy for President.
177	99 92 158 202 106 1 6 10 207 52 177	Dogs are more important than human babies.
177	150 21 145 174 121 119 134 183 129 1 177	Those necklaces look heavy.
177	196 115 142 76 129 10 108 121 213 63 177	Slots on steroids
177	194 118 178 204 187 158 90 190 99 209 177	This tire is going to bust, I think the rubber is weak!
177	22 122 96 206 67 159 38 163 5 20 177	You guys should start a fight or something.
177	98 145 138 156 74 126 105 149 171 164 177	Huge team! I wonder how many water boys they have, or who all has to sit on the bench.
177	57 89 21 141 136 73 193 79 24 166 177	This is the worst slideshow ever.
177	116 173 205 29 182 87 206 179 7 101 177	The jellyfish look scandalous
177	1 116 41 213 207 75 103 94 129 68 177	I hate this picture!
177	145 78 206 188 122 161 193 178 101 100 177	We should definitely get amped and race to this statue.
177	183 16 64 82 180 204 2 155 42 195 177	It is disgraceful to leave during his performance
177	170 46 176 142 95 211 143 86 121 84 177	I couldn't believe just how expansive and large the castle building was.
177	55 140 41 211 95 122 200 46 90 24 177	He may crush that car, get off buddy!
177	98 137 139 43 92 147 116 136 108 35 177	PEW PEW PEW... wait, is that jesus on that flag?
177	66 154 119 24 96 121 197 164 10 47 177	What even is this??? Some genius craziness!!
177	198 26 159 33 119 204 61 166 66 128 177	They are going to attack that player!
177	135 84 42 124 198 168 14 87 93 3 177	The prices they charge for trains are ridiculous.
177	72 195 110 62 132 128 171 44 181 31 177	Loks like the trees are holding hands
177	173 151 119 148 47 183 160 59 75 182 177	This tree has to be 10000 years old.
177	138 31 135 123 48 24 88 93 34 46 177	Look at that move, how could he.
177	183 71 213 14 155 145 40 198 215 158 177	This is not fashion.
177	139 82 136 97 195 96 150 21 189 201 177	That green color is so out theree
177	93 135 33 121 134 169 94 202 156 22 177	I bet I could climb down. I want to climb down....
177	98 114 158 91 137 60 155 103 134 149 177	Why is that dirt in a bowl
177	14 91 209 75 199 128 207 195 50 113 177	i can't believe he is eating the cake!
177	123 57 205 144 184 69 67 153 165 113 177	What a ridiculous protest
177	192 187 21 107 93 191 136 67 44 55 177	It's incredible troubling when people drive their huge vehicles out into nature and mess it up!
177	188 100 91 77 76 28 157 43 153 62 177	How can he play guitar with his eyes closed?
177	91 21 79 20 181 48 162 138 56 147 177	Last time I roasted marshmallows I ate 20 of them
177	157 78 16 72 162 196 13 41 113 198 177	Whoa the road is like oh so super cuuuuurvy.
177	102 105 127 60 30 24 138 140 72 128 177	I want grab that tiger's paws!
177	85 148 114 93 44 81 78 100 158 122 177	It's stupid to get married on the beach
177	165 193 164 20 14 187 72 63 184 67 177	This seems like a lot of fun! I always try to break the exhibits
177	70 149 33 176 107 178 141 144 57 190 177	I can't believe she went out that night!
177	16 6 42 94 161 104 8 201 198 171 177	A beautiful bird flying.
177	195 52 8 5 15 34 154 73 193 215 177	I can't believe trains still look like this, what is it the 70's?
177	108 180 133 135 123 13 53 113 81 91 177	Is that a cage? Or a bed? I hope it's both!
177	207 186 43 55 61 122 112 96 105 150 177	this food looks ridiculous and unappetizing
177	107 103 109 191 117 15 2 38 31 188 177	This girl's outfit is ridiculous for church!
177	116 160 65 16 35 46 60 163 141 201 177	Let me run through the massive kite strings.
177	113 166 102 74 207 174 112 147 26 130 177	Let's ask him for an interview!
177	143 173 94 167 159 39 68 208 168 200 177	Stop, drop, and give me an egg!
177	206 15 178 193 213 191 26 94 192 154 177	HILTON lets get this party started!
177	63 124 52 55 190 171 204 126 99 202 177	What is in the container?
177	56 84 110 87 111 1 91 197 49 96 177	its very danger,but it give excitement to visitors
177	151 43 79 55 141 49 29 122 197 63 177	she's actually running backwards, amazing
177	61 48 181 205 31 196 210 102 138 129 177	I am a God.
177	20 90 81 131 181 48 175 198 190 54 177	Why are those walls so high?
177	58 30 193 201 192 59 181 186 4 182 177	It was literally so dry here! So many cacti! My shirt kept getting caught every single time I walked by one.
177	210 169 59 29 88 35 137 55 129 178 177	I want to steal these items for my own personal use!
177	161 39 21 10 164 84 30 48 38 108 177	These designs are for the wickedly evil!
177	137 120 38 200 94 189 130 37 96 50 177	This is the only seminar I ever need to hear in my life.
177	46 65 208 140 71 130 118 156 141 44 177	Put that chicken on your head!
177	152 7 197 29 51 215 121 203 4 90 177	He should fly through the clouds.
177	55 154 21 181 36 192 95 42 183 124 177	This is the bear that came from another planet
177	72 215 119 176 201 85 184 195 102 14 177	I am going to bungee jump off this building!
177	54 33 156 5 65 133 151 49 134 30 177	The aisle was supposed to be cleared of all visitors.
177	9 195 118 70 163 40 183 34 162 137 177	These look like half zebras half black horses.
177	182 70 100 31 200 111 97 61 15 172 177	Oh god, what a bunch of losers.
177	119 192 31 123 151 161 175 18 17 10 177	Those rocks are just old, large potato.
177	33 43 44 22 203 32 180 201 113 12 177	The stone and brick combination just does not fit the local architecture.
177	139 149 160 5 59 186 93 204 121 96 177	The water way is way too busy in this image.
177	164 4 149 124 211 30 201 80 86 53 177	What? 100 usd a pound of tomates! WHAT???
177	159 97 203 212 213 148 19 133 169 152 177	I can't believe people build these stupid buildings when there are children starving across the world.
177	46 126 45 144 106 27 124 91 20 50 177	Oh my goodness look at those big bright smiles gleaming for the camera!!
177	95 97 80 123 150 171 52 213 133 12 177	What a crappy building!  Who would want to live here?
177	9 58 75 33 141 135 38 17 190 68 177	These people look boring.
177	200 23 107 94 81 100 69 201 184 22 177	Lets get some water and make it a water slide.
177	128 120 91 168 22 117 167 52 16 198 177	What type of absurd event is this! Why would anyone need so much food? I can't even tell what type of food all that is, this is insane
177	166 209 87 1 182 148 199 102 188 149 177	I want to buy this city.
177	150 212 112 109 188 108 59 84 196 31 177	Just, really? The neighbors continually let their dogs poop all over my beautiful lawn!
177	50 3 190 120 69 74 124 83 182 155 177	They give you a cow rear if you buy a vehicle, but the vehicles are so junky they probably won't make it home.
177	130 154 52 175 113 118 56 176 163 68 177	How did a homeless man get a piano?
177	113 166 3 154 165 94 127 186 87 141 177	I hope they are keeping an eye out for the Loch ness monster.
177	60 82 25 50 27 76 208 143 191 120 177	this is an odd looking couple
177	15 140 3 164 141 152 151 21 170 44 177	Let's party all night!
177	20 75 157 79 21 96 207 22 47 13 177	How nuts is it to put such a small sign up.  Who can really see that?
177	201 86 82 68 77 199 154 19 49 105 177	This child looks as if he is mentally disabled.
177	16 61 60 115 23 15 37 135 79 113 177	I want to burn this pool.
177	171 161 184 103 62 70 167 139 90 187 177	this game is awesome
177	24 47 25 10 173 38 184 96 2 18 177	This is so outrageous!
177	190 200 146 137 165 52 215 25 6 75 177	How can this dog walk without the use of his two front paws?
177	76 144 84 180 87 194 123 104 18 58 177	Short hair don't care!
177	143 52 164 55 89 58 37 169 48 135 177	She is so ready for a fantastic time; she loves Cars!
177	18 62 89 93 83 98 121 1 60 122 177	Smugglers are to be punished badly, as they spoil our nation!
177	124 8 148 85 22 137 1 4 89 75 177	This color is the end of me!
177	147 97 87 115 197 211 106 180 45 110 177	Costuming for shows has really gone to the next level!
177	102 114 112 3 103 78 204 80 96 23 177	So who wants to go stand on that wall?
177	56 122 129 49 168 26 36 112 28 188 177	I bet I could jump off this mountain and land in that lake over there.
177	56 79 26 212 22 186 71 124 106 199 177	Sure that's food? Whoever made that should be fired!
177	160 39 9 19 213 83 30 155 151 138 177	Imagine walking with those down a UK street! That would be hilarious!
177	153 205 81 94 167 164 66 187 54 58 177	Alright. Time to drop some beats. Let's party.
177	171 16 37 153 109 118 52 189 194 81 177	I can't imagine a girl not wearing red!
177	79 110 121 96 119 186 66 38 102 171 177	I want to eat that animal!
177	179 158 166 35 180 79 122 112 8 181 177	She should kiss that camel!
177	197 101 122 1 194 135 52 97 137 109 177	What a horridly gloomy day!  This is going to spoil everything!
177	68 141 83 202 60 39 117 36 150 98 177	What a boring show.
177	49 133 169 148 122 107 51 10 94 179 177	I want to drive my car up that staircase!
177	118 27 190 141 67 101 85 182 44 34 177	What are these lads doing? Devising a plan to steal nuclear launch codes or something?
177	33 35 180 59 3 116 25 174 7 136 177	Wow, are they pirates? That's unreal, what are they doing there?
177	70 159 97 183 88 39 171 6 118 62 177	He should challenge the bartender do a drinking contest.  Winner gets free beer for life.
177	112 133 199 128 113 205 56 99 59 27 177	This logo is the most ugly I've ever seen.  The creator put no work into it.
177	92 187 167 58 146 31 91 184 4 34 177	This would be a perfect spot to try some new skateboard stunts.
177	115 190 98 152 107 33 120 133 18 72 177	This kid might fall out of his chair.
177	73 3 79 33 212 125 25 31 156 171 177	I wanna just fly up in the sky!
177	180 197 193 212 160 134 27 206 37 45 177	He doesn't look like he's payinh attention
177	195 37 212 41 213 8 49 126 115 122 177	this looks just silly like a 70's sit in
177	106 35 50 149 62 159 111 168 1 58 177	Nap time has changed since I was a kid
177	211 90 29 212 71 95 6 53 171 111 177	Look at all of the colors this guy used in his powerpoint, OMG it looks like a rainbow!
177	151 204 49 50 171 62 210 9 179 137 177	I would be a nervous wreck if i lived there.
177	113 59 209 143 134 124 86 1 125 48 177	I'd eat literally all of these
177	93 131 156 37 89 29 7 209 128 75 177	The woods are full of wild beasts.
177	75 124 101 186 90 158 170 94 117 204 177	There are way too many candles right there, no way there isn't,
177	88 113 70 22 108 65 209 100 140 144 177	Do you see that giant bird?
177	101 208 215 42 117 20 213 98 203 146 177	They need to start their game right now and go inside they will get sick.
177	160 158 137 188 209 32 55 142 97 2 177	To many choices to make
177	20 114 52 31 204 41 154 8 10 139 177	What are these girls doing talking to this chump. They look like they're having such a dull time and should instead be having fun and swooning over me
177	5 20 1 133 56 169 17 58 16 213 177	Did you see that
177	183 77 118 90 156 114 204 194 158 76 177	I would LOVE to catch some dirt with that bike.
177	43 176 67 171 72 110 150 141 147 192 177	Wow, this bear has been taking some weird medication.
177	106 114 79 92 164 165 51 1 57 48 177	That little boy looks so small next to that night! I can't believe it's not real!
177	10 41 64 79 63 158 160 200 174 124 177	Two animals, one naked in front of the other. They must be loving it.
177	88 7 61 122 202 35 194 173 214 201 177	In the beginning it was unusual for me when I saw this performance!
177	76 70 14 139 87 178 119 5 189 192 177	I think we should give umbrealla wings out to every one there so they can match!
177	187 21 30 101 149 193 12 29 94 164 177	I don't even know how something like this happens!  For heavens sake...
177	107 53 67 71 134 116 92 100 6 8 177	Who rides a horse and cart these days, it just looks ridiculous and where the hell are they headed.
177	62 93 205 160 85 88 48 50 75 156 177	Wow that guy is hairy, i hope he has swim shorts on and not just hairy shorts on .
177	175 119 26 68 147 94 131 139 195 166 177	That smile is crazy wild
177	150 87 2 165 136 107 152 199 63 10 177	This bathroom could use a plastic spider, give the neck guy something to look at!
177	93 86 18 138 16 1 94 101 52 182 177	Why do people put such stupid graffiti all over our city?
177	75 23 107 21 116 9 203 35 117 22 177	we should get all theses LP's and melt them down for roads or something
177	181 49 96 150 82 32 93 104 149 97 177	Those shirts are crazy!  They don't match at all!
177	7 37 158 35 65 10 43 32 44 179 177	Having a roller coaster in the city is ridiculous
177	64 6 154 37 119 86 137 44 40 173 177	That is a lot of black they are wearing!
177	180 58 128 119 83 89 49 85 148 10 177	This exhibition is an eye-catching one, I liked it.
177	199 119 116 57 13 161 113 51 97 89 177	Fall down into the water!
177	122 153 46 61 5 155 133 131 53 194 177	I always like to be in style and make others jealous of me!
177	11 146 108 194 22 68 162 201 134 45 177	This tomb must be a fake, it doesn't have enough detail to be real.
177	21 150 58 57 175 181 137 61 133 15 177	I would have a party in this room.
177	94 158 199 150 5 101 138 104 124 105 177	This house costs way too much!
177	75 134 35 175 206 163 207 189 70 139 177	the fact that people put down so many flags is great
177	116 30 80 10 142 90 41 63 67 89 177	That hat should be removed!
177	185 213 52 209 67 172 44 148 66 39 177	Nobody with glasses should be on a football pitch ever, it just doesn't make sense.
177	188 51 201 17 215 111 75 162 160 147 177	old cars are race cars
177	3 8 118 5 130 62 91 127 124 112 177	I can't believe he got into that league!
177	118 1 145 86 17 119 63 202 149 158 177	I want to take off my clothes and run through there with roman candles in each hand
177	12 188 189 167 135 133 19 204 139 115 177	I love my new computer! I paid only 3k for it.
177	198 184 3 95 31 127 151 99 172 174 177	It's a ghost!
177	102 2 64 9 153 20 66 106 128 176 177	This net is 1000 feet tall and 6000 feet wide I bet!
177	208 130 45 20 146 75 55 113 83 15 177	Don't fall! Fall! Don't fall! Fall!
177	66 59 162 70 40 136 64 10 25 192 177	Wouldn't it be neat if he twirled her right into the crowd?
177	141 133 166 39 108 152 85 150 182 86 177	Why do people take better pics of their animals than they do of things that matter?
177	199 110 211 53 22 149 47 16 24 147 177	They need to hurry up and work faster before that building burns!!
177	164 27 87 215 153 70 95 7 2 117 177	Hey buddy why did you fart in my face?  It's making me gag!
177	10 97 166 140 213 159 193 62 214 36 177	Looks like a great place to have a wedding
177	3 61 139 155 28 66 148 117 94 22 177	This has to be a diorama of the Grand Canyon!
177	150 172 29 46 70 100 171 54 199 125 177	Oh my gosh! That's..that's oh what's his name???
177	20 79 148 62 63 41 35 183 54 116 177	This is why our roads are in such horible shape.
177	119 40 14 149 79 215 56 76 137 203 177	He should grab the mike and start singing America the Beautiful
177	57 212 8 40 99 194 182 188 112 54 177	This is from a really old alien ship.
177	54 174 125 75 95 28 154 2 109 184 177	That award calls for a celebration. Who brought the booze?!
177	153 198 12 188 4 183 31 60 191 59 177	Those tracks look like a great place for a nap!
177	45 35 185 196 48 54 95 83 50 27 177	This looks absolutely crazy wish I was there!!
177	200 211 182 76 31 104 185 158 46 191 177	Those steps inside the building are crazy
177	113 63 125 26 147 78 39 82 64 76 177	If I could I would buy a million of these flowers and cover my entire house with them!
177	29 178 8 168 81 51 62 22 163 59 177	The leaf has a fungus called ring worm.
177	28 150 190 52 134 76 173 111 121 128 177	She was probably complaining about something stupid.
177	168 144 119 58 9 115 213 72 154 199 177	Skydiving right now
177	122 149 186 138 4 74 51 40 132 171 177	I can't believe how little they wear!
177	137 139 186 214 2 127 11 75 41 10 177	These should be the only flowers.
177	209 37 199 210 131 107 67 152 176 27 177	I bet I could tame that giraffe.
177	199 195 17 133 82 101 110 37 196 111 177	This wedding party bored me to tears!
177	186 102 98 73 46 75 199 176 169 85 177	I am going to put one of these in my house!
177	105 83 157 122 132 129 152 172 56 184 177	Yes, yes, I know you've been waiting all day to see me! I promise it won't be in vain!
177	181 18 104 33 16 120 171 122 170 115 177	Aliens intentionally kill those trees.  That's why the leaves are brown.
177	142 4 39 147 32 55 85 186 210 66 177	How dare companies ever change the landscape of anything!
177	196 52 185 87 166 155 141 172 130 26 177	This thing will explode.
177	108 3 206 187 57 97 154 208 203 32 177	I can't believe these guys are just sitting there with all this happening
177	210 142 55 71 154 207 66 151 131 199 177	I hope this lady doesn't fall off  this cliff
177	176 197 164 10 71 205 213 31 162 121 177	Put a smile on your face young man! What's got into you!
177	95 13 102 116 191 14 71 113 65 22 177	This is crazy!
177	194 119 47 166 186 88 212 52 155 28 177	Why would you waste such good bottles.
177	47 19 112 200 161 116 150 192 16 117 177	I can't believe he earned the I'm a boyscout badge.
177	137 59 141 202 70 204 175 126 171 94 177	That backpack looks crazy!
178	65 164 32 161 184 86 10 42 195 2 178	This creature eats poop, disgusting.
178	57 137 44 20 68 208 188 95 48 177 178	That girl looks so annoying and smug
178	85 210 98 20 116 39 105 157 152 86 178	That car is hideous!
178	54 33 144 39 167 172 209 114 80 18 178	Why are advertisements everywhere?  It's so annoying.
178	68 122 140 115 150 148 186 15 169 207 178	The inside of that shed is hard to see.
178	3 70 201 72 108 45 105 174 116 73 178	A woman looks like she feel into the water.
178	49 127 153 98 152 75 192 194 137 37 178	They should not have played him!
178	45 185 188 77 101 53 74 16 140 98 178	Stairs are so hard to walk up.
178	34 80 12 101 31 32 24 163 188 187 178	Who east pizza with only cheese?
178	106 171 8 28 40 210 200 9 97 147 178	Quit smiling at me
178	42 115 210 70 79 29 172 24 57 15 178	I wish that kid would quit playing drums.
178	102 73 168 12 149 175 77 51 33 63 178	this isn't cool
178	144 122 68 177 87 5 116 37 143 152 178	God, too many people around, not doing anything at all....
178	77 65 157 206 103 71 160 162 43 62 178	I am very agrivated
178	164 136 43 29 71 39 179 65 129 111 178	so much traffic in such a tiny spot, every where we turn theres some!
178	28 93 49 188 3 119 45 26 62 17 178	Get away from me with your shenanigans
178	176 67 124 19 131 154 110 80 132 185 178	Doesn't this look a little too complicated! They should have made it better.
178	42 82 166 134 107 40 68 31 83 181 178	I get very argivated when I see pink
178	62 136 117 176 197 109 18 152 25 85 178	hate the rain
178	13 163 149 54 165 140 19 118 166 189 178	They look like they would be awful at playing, I wouldn't be able to stand listening.
178	114 211 50 176 140 117 134 200 83 4 178	He needs to rinse his legs off, the dirt is gross and annoying.
178	125 59 207 122 27 166 126 151 161 17 178	wow, easy on the photoshop
178	70 69 4 103 67 202 172 66 206 7 178	Why would you fill the glass only half full!?
178	67 169 63 42 123 172 119 189 154 4 178	I'm dizzy just looking at this. Exactly what I needed.
178	142 161 97 145 19 58 148 111 37 144 178	Oh great, more young people trying to cosplay Naruto at an expo. It's so played out already, choose a different theme.
178	95 117 147 17 39 162 87 36 58 92 178	This bugs me SO much. Why can't graduates just pay attention to what's happening and not pose for A PICTURE. So annoying.
178	60 120 110 156 129 80 28 3 143 54 178	It would get annoying to see damage to the tree
178	100 198 135 123 111 37 133 81 25 128 178	Great, the 20th straight day of snow and John is still happy.
178	36 155 181 4 88 195 123 174 65 3 178	All those lights would just give me a headache.
178	64 61 135 38 166 21 196 172 50 62 178	What a waste of water, and an annoying sound to hear in the park.
178	1 158 152 47 160 119 173 174 22 130 178	This is the ugliest shoe cleaner I have ever seen. Who would ever waste their money on this?
178	38 107 54 203 41 192 89 37 60 167 178	Nice I guess.
178	66 1 171 44 9 125 3 84 180 83 178	Why don't they just stop clapping already!
178	197 205 183 172 181 201 179 67 100 31 178	Why is she wearing this ugly costume?!
178	187 200 49 58 25 208 156 150 7 189 178	These people look sad, but then we all are deep down.
178	147 16 90 99 48 157 202 77 33 192 178	I guess dressing up and looking stupid is still in fashion.
178	157 177 184 164 6 187 207 140 80 159 178	Bah, why demonstrate. You're just annoying the locals when you do.
178	65 206 155 202 118 123 29 19 156 165 178	I'm sure that train will be in the way of many cars, making people late... again!
178	58 124 146 162 122 141 187 208 179 168 178	Great, you found another blue one, now we can leave. I'm starving!
178	167 183 160 52 150 194 168 213 192 85 178	This is not the competitor I wanted to win.
178	112 50 53 57 81 59 37 205 140 147 178	He doesn't look interested at all in this game, and probably walks every pitch.
178	89 98 96 123 41 62 58 69 4 185 178	Ugh, can't even live in the moment, they need pictures for everything. What happened to Carpe Diem?
178	196 98 93 190 94 118 154 213 58 29 178	Modern architecture is vapid.
178	122 210 186 103 207 154 92 94 185 196 178	Darn it Irene, I hate when these darn mermaids take up the beach with their raves!!
178	112 3 208 82 123 79 119 120 164 12 178	Put the damn gun away!
178	53 10 74 76 49 79 64 82 196 48 178	I am so tired of how long I have to wait for the train to arrive
178	80 29 1 184 82 2 106 72 160 175 178	ancient place to visit
178	159 67 130 18 34 182 98 129 181 115 178	Please give the three most outrageous names for a village and say them with a straight face.
178	41 131 26 199 171 166 40 141 35 212 178	Why does so much architecture have to be so phalic?
178	105 134 195 112 191 16 169 162 146 125 178	These lights hurt my eyes.
178	110 36 54 145 150 181 176 108 91 62 178	That view is so dull
178	143 29 187 174 145 15 195 51 20 105 178	ugh she graduated before i did
178	180 92 177 1 35 37 199 74 43 9 178	He's just begging to get shocked
178	20 106 4 38 128 25 64 54 208 75 178	this a boring seen. I don't like it.
178	96 164 154 107 108 27 101 139 20 165 178	That's just not a pretty bridge and the water is low.
178	34 207 19 83 210 111 85 26 63 177 178	cool, but i'm not impressed
178	4 57 22 163 205 54 122 162 38 82 178	Those flowers, man. They would aggravate my allergies. How can they stand there!?
178	74 186 40 52 182 90 47 170 28 38 178	I wish those statues would stop looking at me....
178	23 13 185 176 60 59 137 189 100 17 178	Why is that man standing there? Why does he have to put his hands there? Ugh! Stop that.
178	5 169 47 119 168 96 159 215 155 94 178	Get the fly off the flower
178	153 75 125 52 78 27 205 121 195 89 178	just go faster already
178	141 43 29 118 103 146 40 33 7 215 178	Why can't that beer just be in normal sized bottles?
178	76 207 23 70 95 110 128 64 93 111 178	I cant believe how dark this picture is
178	149 182 134 148 137 77 52 31 179 80 178	Ugh how can people think this is pretty?
178	65 62 186 86 184 77 187 153 26 190 178	Ugh, that bag looks like garbage.
178	27 215 172 148 95 117 137 108 161 83 178	A good relation
178	157 43 105 83 69 139 98 89 150 6 178	Get out of here with those feet, man!
178	190 179 136 90 57 62 17 119 70 26 178	Man, terrible lighting.
178	139 92 12 200 177 40 15 207 208 189 178	That guy looks JUST like a crappy server I had just last night for dinner.
178	206 76 202 124 192 213 160 117 84 100 178	Why are they so tense? It is good to be alive.
178	38 121 12 52 209 154 15 75 144 101 178	why did they take a picture of this
178	148 156 26 90 94 109 46 107 20 207 178	Why cant i see the building, these trees are making me crazy
178	35 206 176 79 17 168 127 72 74 8 178	I can't believe I got dragged overseas on vacation with my parents. Summer break should be spent with my friends!
178	143 165 94 97 191 72 59 80 200 120 178	The sun is in my eyes!
178	16 137 58 48 92 119 163 60 195 12 178	A picture of a guy taking a picture... how cool. Not.
178	23 130 150 12 207 57 129 198 84 53 178	I hate the fact that those rich people take over the people's beaches.
178	150 186 201 117 10 30 190 131 97 111 178	I have had to sit next to the speaker for 8 hours and now I want to leave.
178	142 19 43 121 188 73 136 167 30 28 178	I came all the way out here now i find out I forgot my beach chair.
178	57 102 190 207 81 19 24 3 163 125 178	Look at this lady flaunting herself for the photographer, drives me nuts
178	86 79 6 209 88 121 23 8 156 174 178	Im so annoyed with this picture.
178	214 131 54 212 36 37 210 79 196 155 178	Someone used peanut sauce so i cannot have any of the food.
178	188 134 201 99 46 144 3 130 141 32 178	Ugh, I really think fountains disrupt beautiful town squares.
178	51 121 140 134 137 196 75 19 1 10 178	Why is someone pearing over the fence?
178	77 206 87 168 176 199 50 81 133 69 178	Why would she have a gun on her? Real or not?
178	23 174 51 139 31 114 25 191 17 142 178	Why such crooked  writing on that board?
178	51 136 123 49 215 179 212 129 188 15 178	God, this person in the reflection is ruining the picture.
178	45 166 173 135 193 167 7 210 40 31 178	These flowers are in my way of viewing the ground, how dare they.
178	5 202 117 48 59 161 211 36 35 91 178	This disgust me because there is no water around.
178	193 180 206 160 141 212 44 76 82 104 178	Why post at such an awkward angle?
178	23 53 147 93 66 136 60 201 75 209 178	I like it when a band takes its work seriously. The guy in the red cap does not look serious. Is he scratching his back?
178	48 195 125 201 113 188 191 197 200 100 178	I don't understand why that man is wearing such a hideous shirt!
178	149 84 193 125 105 73 129 165 144 56 178	It really drives me crazy when people bunch up around a door!
178	94 97 50 181 166 101 123 141 187 73 178	If they cut those trees,the neighbors will be annoyed
178	175 215 165 60 149 110 193 204 45 93 178	This isn't peaceful at all. Surely a boater is going to fly by and spray water everywhere.
178	94 55 84 187 175 131 64 46 116 52 178	These guys need to stop looking at me, they have annoying faces.
178	105 69 63 31 144 27 192 140 184 214 178	I don't like the look of this image. It annoys me.
178	138 50 181 205 112 191 137 190 51 115 178	I hate driving, I really dont like it, I hate it.
178	202 207 192 62 21 32 185 104 116 24 178	Great. Monkeys. Cute. Next?
178	176 213 67 61 131 199 175 143 92 159 178	I wish my wife would do something other than candles and rose for EVERY anniversary.
178	46 71 72 194 13 186 53 108 106 213 178	This picture is so dumb.
178	114 32 62 39 155 100 207 30 93 195 178	I am annoyed by this tortoise.
178	192 197 72 34 158 37 90 99 38 179 178	Do we need to park facing inwards or outwards??
178	48 208 110 199 33 207 42 160 105 76 178	Hate it when cars park on grass, always ruins it...
178	153 194 202 95 111 48 151 24 101 209 178	I don't like all that filthy dirt
178	142 159 29 22 90 208 190 204 119 69 178	I HATE WATER FOUNTAINS WITH UGLY STATUES
178	3 57 207 213 34 43 151 35 136 195 178	noisy atmosphere .. wouldn't it irritate  much?
178	69 136 143 86 154 72 167 56 4 115 178	Must be nice to have this much free time
178	141 17 163 45 193 147 108 170 136 109 178	This is an amazingly shoddy build and a waste of good legos!
178	179 74 108 105 91 95 191 204 78 76 178	So where's the train?
178	42 183 30 46 138 7 71 165 90 134 178	Could you please stop talking already.
178	134 142 176 132 143 27 104 197 155 74 178	Three dogs = three times the work of pooper scooping!
178	141 16 105 148 135 31 64 210 98 172 178	I hate Christmas trees!
178	42 170 80 125 16 89 62 210 13 191 178	Why is the bus always late?
178	146 58 168 140 175 142 1 60 42 141 178	Making that fish face is ruining the picture.
178	120 97 173 45 185 124 92 145 180 107 178	This makes me irritated
178	176 120 153 106 127 210 87 59 188 53 178	She should get over herself
178	106 158 181 88 204 160 61 27 83 195 178	I hate blurry pictures!
178	103 72 93 192 171 113 21 107 54 122 178	Why did someone color all over a perfectly good wall?
178	43 77 64 175 105 89 49 209 190 34 178	The texture of the table cloth annoys me.
178	204 132 114 85 100 133 110 18 61 120 178	The seats look very uncomfortable and agitating and I couldn't sit in them.
178	113 69 110 1 119 192 173 207 100 80 178	What do these arches even mean, anyway?
178	108 209 62 185 92 126 125 149 86 14 178	This photo is blurry, why even post it.
178	145 3 173 159 29 183 168 99 53 207 178	Place looksd like a rip off.
178	61 43 167 97 75 28 123 191 54 84 178	I hate riding over tracks.
178	97 29 106 70 125 31 112 126 44 51 178	I hate rowdy crowds.
178	171 210 92 9 128 153 93 168 138 99 178	I am so annoyed with soccer right now.
178	181 22 13 100 154 137 59 165 81 56 178	Ugh that breakfast is so unhealthy, they should really be more health conscious.
178	90 63 98 83 124 29 188 193 209 212 178	Wow are they actually spraying the plants with a machine.
178	75 162 203 20 198 5 180 129 106 56 178	Wind energy just wonder work  They are wasting their money for nothing.
178	29 24 1 52 135 55 193 78 152 110 178	I don't even want to know what this little girl is doing because i've had a terrible day.
178	15 71 119 85 53 31 89 109 136 149 178	I can't believe people waste their time dressing up and playing like this.
178	3 99 118 15 17 53 146 96 185 19 178	Why do you have to make it such a hassle just to open the box. There's no need to tie things around it.
178	23 50 9 17 72 7 113 29 200 118 178	To be this close in number and during the race.
178	123 174 157 213 31 133 177 24 182 35 178	Ugh the bright colored graffiti makes my eyes bleed.
178	34 8 98 181 204 81 177 92 213 151 178	It's dark and bright at the same time, it bothers me
178	105 43 52 177 189 41 18 176 114 195 178	I can't seem to get what this is trying to say.
178	123 146 122 156 76 186 45 72 113 95 178	Look at this smug geezer, I bet his RV smells as bad as he looks.
178	30 62 25 14 84 210 143 11 204 164 178	Those dogs are super dumb
178	133 60 52 98 75 85 191 150 123 58 178	All these people around me are so annoying! I need to get out of here.
178	9 76 122 163 127 47 88 3 17 20 178	Foreign currency confuses and stresses me.
178	10 176 62 47 207 53 193 187 70 167 178	What an ugly building, do they not send architects to design school anymore?
178	208 204 134 141 29 35 22 95 175 96 178	i bet they wish that boring meeting was over.
178	52 53 94 215 122 106 23 168 141 104 178	I can't stand the way he plays.
178	159 54 33 41 203 132 65 101 91 189 178	I think this concert is probably a bust.
178	82 80 86 49 126 30 120 10 213 174 178	I hate the cold. What are they doing. They're going to lose their toes to frost bite, but they don't even care about the risks
178	55 135 137 97 154 18 69 94 65 167 178	Why is he holding the ball in stead of playing on?
178	96 16 41 54 82 60 117 10 35 46 178	Something is a school teacher
178	187 180 176 52 84 146 117 102 197 204 178	Ugh this picture is so blurry, I can barely tell what's going on!
178	65 99 159 101 72 147 127 129 200 205 178	So many locks on a door? Would hate living in such a house.
178	6 148 99 90 35 214 29 196 141 107 178	It takes so much time to grow flowers. Not worth it!
178	102 34 167 145 41 194 173 78 27 66 178	An empty street feels me moody, specially without the people!
178	174 175 29 97 215 139 6 133 131 188 178	This women is going to waste that plastic.
178	1 198 45 213 7 51 82 92 138 18 178	If one of those candles goes out I imagine it will be a real pain to fix.
178	19 115 194 64 33 23 72 26 154 36 178	The clouds need to go away, we do not need any rain!
178	83 207 136 206 115 85 93 203 192 150 178	This kind of hand crafted art work for children or even for adults is just not my cup of tea.
178	143 101 164 155 4 29 128 150 49 110 178	i hate seeing animals behind fences and things. really makes my blood boil
178	122 157 97 91 126 79 209 55 146 185 178	some speech to crowed
178	101 113 57 127 77 169 42 108 1 212 178	Man, I wish they'd do something about all the creepy hobos around out city lately.
178	149 116 58 30 195 72 104 179 214 20 178	This genre of art bothers me. What is the point?
178	158 104 96 59 35 211 195 140 138 71 178	This is graphic and bothers me.
178	157 122 127 10 98 189 91 33 166 138 178	Disgusting, smelly cow. Stop leaving pats on the grass!
178	168 175 189 25 131 78 22 201 66 21 178	A slow and pathetic drama shows are always annoying!
178	159 15 138 174 119 51 79 66 7 145 178	His form is off.
178	126 33 75 29 73 76 132 30 63 13 178	Ugh I always lose on that level!
178	172 187 130 150 29 175 26 121 36 93 178	Please close your window
178	196 37 82 128 138 18 184 152 166 2 178	Chevy. Meh. No self respecting man drives a Chevy!
178	26 55 77 76 83 101 86 156 59 74 178	Why did this need to happen in a public place. It bothers me when people impose their art.
178	145 26 189 143 197 40 111 196 119 61 178	Why do people like dogs so much anyway? Everywhere I look I see a dog, it looks like they are more important than humans
178	124 211 55 194 100 170 165 108 197 128 178	why are people so loud at baseball games
178	18 60 163 143 94 168 105 127 77 87 178	Ugh I hate when people take pictures of movie screens, so annoying.
178	65 126 199 82 90 83 179 120 3 119 178	It is so frustrating !I want to  be close to the front so bad
178	80 48 34 96 23 19 121 196 103 163 178	That kind of repair work is annoying.
178	159 142 176 130 97 124 214 115 148 122 178	Something gets on my nerves about that place
178	88 208 161 146 32 200 175 97 162 23 178	Not even a great view.
178	190 188 165 68 31 50 89 5 57 93 178	There are too many leaves and flowers on the ground, it's too cluttered.
178	66 100 113 182 6 202 59 3 140 96 178	It looks like it's going to rain on our lake day.
178	39 168 109 65 146 177 164 197 111 125 178	This music is way too loud
178	30 188 10 213 162 22 171 127 84 215 178	When is this going to be over
178	108 86 43 205 23 24 146 119 106 35 178	Every time someone wants to have a job or bike ride they have to take up the whole road!
178	121 117 202 21 214 109 11 170 7 39 178	Cant they hold that baby's head correctly?! That makes me mad.
178	14 69 176 148 51 162 136 152 74 24 178	Why do they have to be so dramatic.
178	42 182 172 122 142 21 186 5 190 132 178	Not nearly enough food. I'd starve
178	71 6 55 75 13 94 16 185 156 38 178	Mountains just make me angry.
178	179 197 176 43 143 63 122 68 35 134 178	Ugh how can people be skeptical about Javascript
178	196 10 76 19 149 125 32 127 70 190 178	Sunrise, sunset. Sunrise, sunset.  Doesn't take much talent to take photos of these.
178	214 168 17 10 80 134 202 124 136 155 178	This is so awful
178	4 53 183 35 157 97 214 90 54 91 178	Very repulsive depiction with tiny legs and giant head
178	41 30 148 46 100 18 122 3 12 56 178	I miss the countryside.
178	83 156 63 12 32 67 6 26 141 94 178	Ugh, he needs to fix his collar. Seriously. It's bothering me.
178	87 3 111 214 158 27 99 133 34 143 178	Why do you have to run like that!
179	16 57 81 11 153 34 152 43 67 187 179	The boy looks very frightened to me.
179	109 190 34 182 66 215 61 72 174 144 179	What are all of these people up to? I doubt they even know.
179	2 33 51 141 118 158 188 214 40 52 179	Wonder how they got the money for such a house...legitimate?
179	151 161 16 117 90 121 150 84 129 68 179	those roads are so narrow.
179	20 29 61 199 17 178 119 38 49 124 179	I am a little leary to go to the cocert
179	213 128 66 12 20 127 14 132 155 185 179	Scary weird object
179	165 15 93 132 209 173 126 90 28 49 179	Maybe if we are lucky, winter will be easy on us this year.
179	145 12 65 18 119 35 157 123 154 144 179	three left feet
179	135 145 176 170 174 182 116 61 168 58 179	I don't know about walking down a beach in sandles like that.
179	62 11 204 51 43 128 142 202 5 53 179	There probably isn't even any tea in that pot
179	178 88 36 53 72 57 20 69 74 187 179	I really doubt that she finished.
179	185 146 129 115 131 19 69 200 164 191 179	I think this person wrote in cursive so they couldn't be understood.
179	68 181 87 69 92 202 49 212 188 76 179	This guy is going to fall on his face and light himself on fire!
179	129 51 93 112 5 96 199 163 78 156 179	I think this photo might be fake, that sunlight looks way too perfect on the horizon.
179	200 167 54 113 10 107 43 101 128 108 179	You can keep claiming this is the aftermath of a 'ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE', but it is obviously CONSTRUCTION work being done. Idiot.
179	144 54 64 21 66 56 208 42 132 177 179	That copy machine looks to be about the right size for an office, but why would it be located in the corner office overlooking the street?
179	177 89 210 204 137 84 36 208 145 171 179	I'm not sure if she is singing or dancing, or both
179	32 192 142 188 80 206 143 54 122 25 179	This group looks like they are up to something, don't you think?
179	118 139 18 180 55 50 16 207 42 199 179	I am not sure this is not a movie. The quality of the picture leads me to believe that it is a scene in a movie about planes.
179	183 83 1 149 92 112 96 134 196 33 179	It looks like something strange is going on here. What are they supposed to be doing?
179	97 135 139 86 32 112 166 77 15 187 179	I'm not sure if there's enough light in this room
179	97 208 196 16 13 66 93 215 11 120 179	I do not feel great about the conbination of tuna and green peppers.
179	126 3 22 212 90 187 51 103 95 127 179	I wonder if America is really great today.
179	17 151 46 79 44 104 82 91 59 198 179	This event looks weird.
179	169 58 174 168 83 13 101 81 10 91 179	this looks fake
179	27 102 62 127 77 147 121 122 119 41 179	This looks like a church, but I don't think I want to be in it. It doesn't look too strong, or clean.
179	40 120 201 90 205 149 180 4 152 168 179	I think they want to play on the swings.
179	209 121 169 198 60 48 47 19 155 82 179	Those guys are sitting down to eat, but I am skeptical that there's enough food to feed them all.
179	102 172 71 144 40 36 123 119 81 41 179	Is she really a model?
179	152 161 113 101 46 44 147 85 200 144 179	Why pay so much for a dumb game?
179	15 123 106 47 30 209 68 128 67 121 179	I doubt that baby is comfortable in that little hat. How could he be? it looks itchy.
179	46 212 107 112 134 189 101 97 188 64 179	I am not sure what the food is on this plate.
179	203 187 41 118 32 128 186 164 126 158 179	Yeah I'm not gonna trust my life to a tiny cable. Count me out!
179	82 44 143 74 124 95 33 45 214 80 179	A pleasant day with blue sky
179	46 186 135 14 146 158 67 169 78 153 179	I don't think they're really having fun.
179	187 210 128 213 13 206 22 79 203 168 179	will he finish the race
179	201 76 102 126 36 66 137 160 79 97 179	I wonder why the person in the back is wearing sunglasses?
179	90 173 62 158 63 35 21 44 50 40 179	Those boats need to be prepared for the weather
179	122 48 205 92 137 188 198 139 37 86 179	I don't know about this.
179	41 66 189 108 106 36 211 99 178 208 179	What is the person mixing
179	8 91 67 83 95 164 157 102 40 134 179	I wonder if those wires work?
179	55 92 193 144 66 124 152 204 49 130 179	I don't think that this photo is able to clearly depict anything.
179	89 107 103 65 82 15 79 209 213 190 179	This seems a little sketchy....are we the only people here?
179	19 80 53 176 83 30 154 36 60 77 179	I'm not sure he's going to make the shot.
179	118 103 155 194 13 197 45 61 52 162 179	These actors are looking a little over the top so I doubt this play is any good.
179	51 19 150 205 16 101 18 162 74 99 179	I wonder if she actually knows how to direct the boat or is actually docked and posing for the picture?
179	39 123 200 64 132 176 101 126 196 50 179	Look like High school party
179	74 208 52 82 127 160 182 106 164 12 179	There are too few people around. Something must be going down.
179	126 184 73 54 21 74 14 82 193 33 179	I'm not sure if that's a good environment to be keeping a bunch of cows.
179	61 110 89 68 95 75 169 55 124 194 179	Hmm...are you sure you want to stay here for the night? It doesn't look so good...
179	194 176 150 93 137 185 37 198 14 6 179	I doubt that surface is sanitary
179	142 170 213 87 171 168 195 130 94 132 179	Hmmm. I wonder what he's looking for.
179	22 163 191 140 74 72 6 155 16 98 179	I don't think I can fix it.
179	76 195 163 171 82 106 95 185 45 199 179	I am nervous of swimming with the sharks.
179	57 35 156 53 175 163 185 58 17 162 179	This looks staged.
179	162 29 114 134 155 95 142 201 46 25 179	I doubt those boots will keep me dry.
179	160 158 194 119 130 41 105 184 159 22 179	i think  this is a wax person.
179	190 56 188 66 113 192 91 167 43 129 179	Is this real or edited?
179	192 166 134 70 26 197 37 83 183 182 179	I highly doubt this is an actual picture of a field.
179	83 46 80 98 162 117 86 171 119 5 179	This seagull has obviously wants better handouts.
179	94 81 72 1 44 162 207 78 7 169 179	The dessert looks good, but I doubt that it was homemade.
179	87 114 9 167 52 200 22 180 134 194 179	The students are all ready for the program but let's hope it doesn't rain today.
179	131 126 11 25 121 144 1 106 184 47 179	I don't trust that guy.
179	10 53 184 13 150 136 32 97 16 181 179	I am not so sure I can swim this.
179	25 205 98 185 206 187 188 167 183 3 179	I think this is a fake memorial.
179	89 38 170 151 166 72 107 120 29 159 179	Are we doing this or not?
179	13 114 207 93 215 189 163 159 18 39 179	Even if the refrigerator is almost empty, "almost empty" is as empty as it's going to get.
179	42 139 28 115 34 180 178 206 2 37 179	I recognize that many believe they could scale these mountains, but seeing is believing, and I don't see anyone attempting it.
179	66 98 149 3 174 75 93 19 199 193 179	im not sure that shack is sturdy
179	107 168 164 34 80 96 187 120 32 147 179	Hmm. Not too sure if this photo is real. The colors are too bright.
179	132 139 49 79 90 164 43 195 83 65 179	Im not so sure how amazing this flower really is.
179	115 4 82 136 58 113 191 80 14 105 179	The mountains are beautiful but also make me uneasy.
179	94 152 54 97 177 103 201 101 215 18 179	The baby's hand looks out of proportion, I bet the picture is fake.
179	185 79 156 124 180 150 188 85 129 121 179	I wonder if that kid really likes the Giants or is just wearing the shirt.
179	91 95 121 146 187 108 164 71 78 152 179	So much busyness. So little real meaning.
179	205 47 176 25 56 78 158 212 160 101 179	From the expression on her face you can clearly tell she is up to mischief.
179	207 67 188 178 210 47 161 197 12 122 179	I'm not sure i can belive how big that is.
179	29 11 24 111 118 215 196 203 72 174 179	She doesn't seem that interested
179	206 93 38 213 115 27 31 128 165 134 179	Can that thing drive down the road without falling over?
179	21 125 38 188 25 167 117 80 135 189 179	Are they really having a good time or is this a posed picture?
179	86 111 87 186 121 67 24 125 96 45 179	What do you want to bet this is in a park area and just to the left are a bunch of picnickers and parked cars?
179	207 126 194 33 109 173 28 2 158 50 179	You call this art?
179	151 139 123 107 88 197 33 38 49 20 179	I doubt humans designed this clock, they had supernatural help.
179	213 212 77 41 4 175 93 161 107 190 179	I have a hard time believing anything this pretty is growing around Washington D.C.
179	185 53 72 98 21 89 23 79 63 51 179	Im not sure that plance works properly.
179	138 186 128 160 95 146 189 94 86 123 179	The day care says they're just going to the park, but I've been hearing from the kids that they're making extra stops that are not approved.
179	72 4 103 63 213 38 73 27 159 189 179	Im not sure people in the image are real, or at least in its mayority.
179	135 21 141 149 32 172 188 192 109 171 179	I cant tell if they are happy, or plotting my death
179	180 120 55 175 23 31 211 36 58 126 179	Waiting for the loch ness monster to pop up.
179	67 80 145 103 164 178 113 1 59 108 179	that game is dengerous even for me
179	164 29 154 139 201 105 12 191 78 9 179	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HECK THAT IS AND I AM NOT GONNA TOUCH IT.
179	162 65 1 63 215 114 183 72 66 34 179	its unlikely those cats will fall out
179	33 205 112 194 154 146 138 174 15 184 179	Whoa, these flowers almost look too perfect like they were photoshopped.
179	113 207 167 166 33 168 180 125 145 146 179	They said this assembly line is sterile and free of bacteria, but I'm not so sure after seeing it firsthand.
179	73 150 185 182 187 66 62 34 97 51 179	Is that a beer?
179	142 153 90 52 96 188 30 63 22 18 179	I'm not sure that I would want to bike here, there's not much to see and it looks pretty boring.
179	176 75 93 38 43 165 108 12 80 198 179	Is that even a real beer?
179	185 203 40 34 15 72 162 53 208 70 179	I don't think planes are as safe as they say.
179	161 45 41 85 115 50 75 3 196 160 179	The alligator is quite scary
179	193 137 190 115 160 214 20 86 58 162 179	This medical facility doesn't look like it does very good work.
179	61 132 192 185 84 115 76 204 157 69 179	I am unsure if this is good architecture.
179	108 46 94 157 41 138 76 84 117 45 179	I wonder if this is part of some church
179	7 47 135 169 73 10 102 150 89 23 179	I really thin the lighting is off.
179	57 34 72 197 47 156 203 105 17 154 179	I highly doubt those tiny front tires will last more than one, MAYBE two races.
179	58 140 148 194 112 207 208 117 15 102 179	I highly doubt that scarf will sell this season/
179	103 9 215 115 154 11 204 30 44 139 179	I don't think they
179	198 189 186 75 5 4 137 160 191 145 179	THe place looks fantastic but I odn't think I can ever reach the top to enjoy it.
179	45 118 203 32 97 198 131 34 70 56 179	I doubt the age of this building.
179	176 168 182 5 124 166 118 77 58 189 179	What's the point of this picture?
179	212 154 120 186 44 122 92 37 86 89 179	I don't think that is real.  How can a cannabis flower get that big?
179	102 18 37 77 101 90 106 6 201 78 179	I bet they can't even play.
179	67 14 135 200 115 59 69 160 184 176 179	I doubt the lighting in that room is blue.
179	63 33 163 144 47 206 98 81 43 97 179	Huh, it must be another "CHARITY" event....like any of the money actually goes to the cause...
179	208 89 22 173 155 181 150 133 215 43 179	Are these real flowers?
179	122 84 119 106 48 8 17 136 71 168 179	Im not looking forward to the next meetup, looks like rain
179	126 212 161 19 40 97 139 13 73 201 179	I somehow doubt that is your natural hair color.
179	23 111 4 214 160 7 162 182 2 8 179	I doubt these people have any reasonable intention to be in this place
179	90 43 89 187 104 180 75 44 34 36 179	All these people must be up to no good.
179	39 47 147 128 201 140 41 71 215 35 179	Could this bike be stolen.  You can't be too careful.
179	183 124 70 196 99 23 101 125 104 181 179	I don't think that these came out right.  They appear to be falling apart.
179	83 70 184 192 190 5 99 81 118 201 179	I don't think that person's hand is under 50 years old.
179	104 107 101 208 213 192 142 205 139 19 179	I am not sure this is purple.
179	205 144 163 153 155 29 213 44 122 85 179	Is this really a real town?
179	135 211 26 16 48 184 127 198 79 66 179	So are you telling me that ou lady is on heaven, wiith her full human body?
179	120 60 165 70 189 49 51 115 195 188 179	Going a little fast there, aren't you buddy? Do you even know the speed limit here?
179	43 136 5 92 134 210 125 36 169 150 179	Someone hurt this guy's feelings.
179	91 66 201 162 15 3 112 83 18 168 179	What are these awards for?
179	151 213 64 81 197 88 36 185 182 24 179	What's going on over there?
179	213 180 67 204 47 63 127 92 176 65 179	For some reason I feel like this is not the right queen now servants?
179	98 199 49 207 140 131 109 164 154 87 179	I'm not sure what this leads to but I am not about to find out when it looks too eerie.
179	171 73 44 209 185 63 56 7 167 158 179	I don't think that this man will get the job dressed like that.
179	50 2 3 24 192 55 14 145 37 204 179	Black cats are bad luck you know.
179	99 24 90 193 16 86 85 75 134 6 179	I don't see how those cakes are going to stack with a round top like that.
179	191 170 91 59 57 101 33 15 164 62 179	Is this just a parade or is this a covert military march for some unknown mission.
179	77 130 5 199 59 172 45 17 152 41 179	This is probably just a close up shot of something super small.
179	191 166 109 149 28 126 145 165 129 26 179	270000 looks like a good score, but the top 10 may be in the millions.
179	128 2 96 4 57 167 180 187 66 24 179	I really hope this laptop is under warranty. Maybe the photo is made for artistic purposes though.
179	209 111 21 175 154 32 122 169 53 157 179	Despite the curve of the sky in this panorama (exagerrated by the camera) it is completely consistent the earth is hollow/concave and we are surrounded by a reflective dome. Reflecting light provides energy to those who Live Inside
179	135 132 47 3 190 131 196 6 150 148 179	Is that time accurate? I think it's fake news.
179	134 81 149 126 41 66 194 61 46 70 179	Can this lady really sing?
179	136 110 170 166 50 51 124 180 8 100 179	That path looks pretty slippery, I doubt anyone could walk down there easily.
179	66 76 48 134 181 24 206 205 20 25 179	I wonder if the artist is a real artist.
179	113 5 63 204 141 53 169 190 180 78 179	I would not want to be anywhere near these.
179	48 43 91 150 26 132 9 62 101 13 179	That pizza looks dubious
179	67 12 45 63 215 178 8 165 7 78 179	Those lines overhead seem a bit too close to the tracks.
179	165 205 6 38 178 190 105 112 88 97 179	I'm not so sure if the crowd loved their performance.
179	62 45 123 175 131 193 126 202 153 4 179	I don\t know if parking the trucks next to each other like that was a great idea.
179	158 83 25 2 22 97 62 112 181 161 179	I doubt that is a duck.
179	81 55 183 107 19 158 186 79 11 177 179	Doubting whether  there is a warehouse nearby this place
179	85 115 25 62 83 177 40 151 215 32 179	It's blurry so I really can't be sure
179	143 20 184 150 32 93 92 77 171 183 179	I doubt that the kid in the left going to win the fight, I support the one in the right.
179	100 84 194 204 147 154 214 118 18 146 179	Is this a gay club or a straight club?
179	192 46 35 197 122 90 142 64 105 129 179	I don't trust that building.
179	176 92 3 185 172 182 56 153 81 28 179	It's more logical if that sign was placed in the tree, instead of the tree growing around it.
179	50 81 66 201 10 41 151 11 2 44 179	This wood looks like its not real.
179	9 209 18 128 70 185 82 142 183 130 179	He is unsure about this
179	50 146 202 64 124 135 93 201 193 80 179	I doubt this is a real representation of this building.
179	128 126 167 188 87 63 182 7 9 170 179	Not sure about this group.
179	125 195 167 30 111 79 98 129 83 188 179	Do you think all of these people deserve their awards.
179	155 132 21 87 168 64 92 62 149 133 179	that is going to be so bad on thier necks... oh well
179	34 209 65 14 100 137 181 23 104 122 179	Is that purple flower growing there?
179	60 114 170 136 41 187 129 56 94 151 179	I'm not sure whether that is pink or why I'm looking at it.
179	198 106 12 141 50 3 97 31 184 84 179	I am not sure if that is a real concert, or just staged for a movie.
179	31 67 166 112 52 142 78 42 77 1 179	This probably isn't event hat old.
179	176 202 15 58 14 54 149 41 83 215 179	They said it'll be fixed by the morning
179	184 202 87 36 66 177 40 203 18 78 179	I feel like this is a butternut yellow and not a paradise yellow. I'd like another comparison.
179	161 63 35 10 47 178 186 121 3 8 179	I'm not sure if I'm supposed to follow him into that cave or not...
179	22 156 132 147 162 8 103 63 1 215 179	That looks caffeinated.
179	6 115 19 39 155 69 173 142 12 149 179	Are you sure you know what is actually in those jars?
179	69 129 153 22 177 91 156 146 11 72 179	I do not think you will find a secret panel in it just because it is old.
179	19 172 66 156 8 51 104 88 50 131 179	Why is she clutching her purse so agressively?
179	97 74 66 156 206 27 145 2 144 185 179	I doubt that ad will work in that location.
179	139 71 133 146 143 96 48 1 198 90 179	What is the point of this room?
179	104 14 48 147 99 141 127 181 131 159 179	Not sure if she made this or not.
179	31 174 83 47 139 45 188 212 190 71 179	You didn't take that
179	203 196 172 152 49 86 153 8 76 181 179	do i need to ?
179	211 45 200 32 133 174 42 112 30 172 179	I dont think this view is real. I think it is a painting set in a window.
179	5 35 68 98 169 57 118 115 15 171 179	I feel like that little girl really doesn't want to be there.
179	30 213 57 191 87 74 37 118 48 65 179	Something tells me this photo is staged...
179	206 29 172 154 138 181 117 31 121 64 179	If this is what you call art, I have a bone to pick with you.
179	104 176 9 215 36 118 1 112 33 38 179	There's no way that woman will be able to start a fire with those sticks.
179	122 203 10 156 129 193 25 50 79 52 179	I'm not sure those figures are accurate.
179	71 181 24 34 30 48 124 75 55 183 179	Unsure whats behind the door
179	53 193 81 73 38 116 30 127 204 109 179	This photo looks photoshopped.
179	84 30 75 17 202 143 2 107 65 42 179	No way is that sky real.
179	143 166 66 47 48 186 21 51 123 158 179	This looks straight out of a kit from Joanne's Fabrics, not creative.
179	201 41 180 50 114 197 18 205 191 208 179	I'm not sure the owner of this is a good person.
179	144 42 210 45 188 20 151 44 205 1 179	let the knight begin, who knows how this will end
179	73 56 180 91 117 189 108 48 212 194 179	I don't know if this is a wholesome meeting.
180	126 118 131 7 190 53 23 215 181 57 180	Oh great, a fire. I've had enough bad experiences with that before...
180	168 37 190 174 43 198 95 183 64 201 180	I hate fast rivers, it makes it impossible to cross.
180	166 133 212 42 115 198 39 199 15 44 180	Dang, i wish i was there too!
180	157 117 100 28 188 7 94 24 118 81 180	Wish I could look back and remember memories like this...
180	37 88 210 110 40 162 28 140 144 32 180	The man is bitter
180	129 84 24 123 165 103 56 53 96 136 180	They always get whatever they want
180	78 132 6 81 28 149 58 130 206 188 180	The color green reminds of me of all the times I had to mow the lawn as a kid.
180	99 48 111 179 127 115 173 67 10 93 180	I just don't like him.
180	6 108 120 211 48 172 98 81 71 208 180	So you think you are the only one who could capture this shot?
180	174 25 61 117 63 35 12 88 109 26 180	My skies are always cloudy.
180	25 206 213 2 42 54 39 86 56 193 180	I hate that color. It doesn't suit it well.
180	138 18 70 84 184 102 40 61 157 142 180	Why do they get a parade, fat people don't get one.
180	168 156 99 138 128 87 132 212 22 209 180	People always get to speak before I do.
180	181 184 58 145 68 26 156 117 199 141 180	Wow, the animal get a waterfall with fresh water while there are people fighting for water in other countries.
180	80 92 161 4 201 76 78 74 22 46 180	I lost my keys in that church, so I refuse to go there now.
180	198 120 97 182 201 203 34 7 50 193 180	Looks like a nice pond to fish in
180	167 140 54 88 157 176 129 99 14 211 180	This woman looks like she's got some anger on her mind and is ready to crank that saw!
180	45 193 129 136 165 14 182 189 57 89 180	You all revere the colorful, pretty Rhopalocera, like they're the only insects on the planet. I'm just a moth in a world of butterflies.
180	91 119 101 98 140 30 123 54 36 132 180	This is the face of a woman that shut down my business.  Her shady business practices are awful.
180	25 69 56 82 45 210 99 164 70 189 180	SHe can't believe she has to wait in the hot sun so the ship to come.
180	123 21 191 142 145 39 74 157 181 188 180	I cant even read that silly language...write it in English already
180	109 188 89 211 127 190 60 30 111 103 180	This even might have been more fun if I were invited!
180	130 39 54 56 212 188 53 108 79 19 180	I wish I could still play if my knee weren't jacked up.
180	60 186 105 23 91 119 73 101 168 211 180	It's dull and empty, I wouldn't buy a ticket.
180	44 161 179 18 108 172 127 111 112 19 180	I don't know what this is, and photographers should try harder.
180	32 48 127 21 78 80 7 55 204 17 180	My dog should have won the competition.
180	200 26 54 213 138 104 181 145 47 113 180	Why couldn't l have been one of those beach poles?
180	59 202 25 48 47 81 75 11 120 4 180	Whoever knocked that sign over should do jail time.
180	31 35 105 214 208 150 8 138 192 86 180	I wish I could have gone this year. Damn.
180	28 128 54 145 14 8 97 118 70 51 180	He should get a wig or something.
180	214 137 78 65 7 13 173 64 206 148 180	This event is all about cheap patriotism.
180	136 178 6 118 27 209 127 133 132 167 180	There goes our safe neighborhood.
180	94 8 189 63 211 66 31 47 12 187 180	I'd have a car like that if it wasn't for someone else wasting my money. I work hard, if anyone should have that car, its me. No one else.
180	199 70 188 88 69 44 139 195 207 121 180	Green is too busy of a color for me.
180	13 114 111 42 21 75 196 3 170 24 180	I wish I had a old van like that.
180	48 210 188 173 110 172 6 138 199 103 180	Why would this building only leave one door open?  So annoying.
180	72 109 157 126 107 110 51 205 71 7 180	The flower will soon die
180	123 109 154 171 215 192 93 190 125 76 180	Judging the world through concieted eyes
180	59 145 109 19 60 103 84 21 32 113 180	I absolutely hate parks, they never did anything good for me or my neighborhood
180	112 111 37 44 203 108 6 49 102 134 180	The peeps look like they know alot, but could use a little better diet.
180	206 154 38 156 90 77 159 113 150 122 180	I can't believe he got the part over me when I'm clearly the better musician.
180	110 140 43 192 15 116 117 74 143 10 180	All those nasty birds ever do is poop all over the place and block my view.
180	54 205 214 133 15 112 203 170 126 7 180	What a bunch of pigs, leaving a mess like that.
180	147 83 94 78 140 14 48 114 174 74 180	No one I know looks like that.
180	11 112 56 109 100 4 3 18 196 209 180	People are what has truly ruined our world.
180	43 113 207 160 170 193 110 178 132 146 180	I wish I had a camera that nice.
180	163 150 159 13 103 99 95 39 155 4 180	This place will change to you
180	183 95 70 28 171 98 128 196 115 43 180	Someone has way too many books
180	85 21 68 105 141 197 187 176 162 10 180	I wish I would not have taken by surf board through that
180	55 57 81 164 137 111 10 124 188 48 180	Not everyone gets the chance to see this skyline in their lifetime.
180	195 107 159 8 104 11 31 89 210 212 180	These people look like they made a mistake and feel bad about it.
180	129 199 153 53 102 192 22 11 93 130 180	I regret not being a vegetarian after seeing this.
180	170 46 11 121 153 176 158 137 83 147 180	Whoever put that Orchid in an arid environment clearly doesn't want it to live long. I could take better care of it.
180	8 164 75 90 106 214 95 98 20 11 180	It's sad that such a beautiful picture is overrun with tourists.
180	66 186 115 188 193 177 105 111 107 28 180	having much people at places like gym feels like irritating as i can not be able to exercise freely
180	7 190 111 211 110 62 29 10 125 119 180	November 2010 was a horible month
180	153 122 190 14 16 93 4 117 44 195 180	I resent the fact she went to that party.
180	121 19 76 71 10 161 145 164 191 184 180	I wonder how they ended up there
180	50 10 23 91 35 57 110 32 190 89 180	Most animals would prefer to live in their natural environment not a zoo.
180	80 107 132 31 181 47 57 35 113 139 180	i don't like the bush fire,it creates a lot of smoke
180	5 79 16 110 210 176 105 205 6 17 180	I wish I could run a marathon must be nice
180	1 178 155 6 200 7 13 148 61 29 180	I really hate it when I'm asked to look at nothing and come up with a statement about it!
180	187 205 64 74 56 111 206 134 43 106 180	Oh sure, they used some other landscaper over me. It doesn't even look worthy of this atmosphere!
180	4 117 178 165 200 174 6 62 48 72 180	This place is not where I want to be.
180	170 181 211 115 101 192 111 134 80 145 180	I wish this place had more pavement.
180	194 68 107 93 49 61 23 114 146 98 180	He doesn't deserve to be up there!
180	22 142 202 87 207 96 95 118 25 205 180	Definitely wish I had not spent money on this.
180	96 124 101 13 156 205 51 38 213 60 180	I really don't like what's going on here
180	1 67 197 169 2 24 73 137 30 133 180	Im mad that someone elected him to office.
180	92 188 27 132 34 177 203 52 40 95 180	How dare she marry him? He's the worst. I hate him.
180	176 37 52 202 92 136 101 69 113 13 180	interesting pic, i suppose. why the odd angle?
180	67 1 76 181 105 110 148 38 93 108 180	I wish I had been the one to see this in person, not you.
180	146 76 43 156 2 23 136 176 139 68 180	I wish this wasn't cut off like this.
180	200 40 96 74 189 28 107 132 13 164 180	I wish I was a beautiful as that flower.
180	133 211 109 61 125 162 1 76 144 203 180	I wish I was as free as the rushing water tumbling over those rocks.
180	69 172 66 10 161 176 206 123 55 213 180	I once worked here until i gave up on them.
180	211 38 214 21 205 42 28 55 60 149 180	This trunk is too big, it must surely hit very hard
180	51 11 9 185 47 39 118 195 37 182 180	I want much more to look at.
180	75 110 201 48 47 89 184 8 185 148 180	That student showing tension in their face regarding project
180	181 189 67 84 91 29 59 64 168 111 180	How about no? You cant force people to just except God
180	164 77 56 160 142 116 7 161 24 59 180	It must be nice to lay around all day.
180	214 128 209 35 114 13 136 48 22 171 180	growing up i never had all these to play with. someone did a lousy job.
180	9 113 174 205 193 147 158 57 23 53 180	I could have traveled the world and seen this mountain in person, instead I wasted my life.
180	2 58 64 79 96 98 157 40 173 92 180	I wish I had a fan here.
180	199 19 4 201 92 145 162 39 63 7 180	Girl, get that relay rope in place !
180	138 58 81 133 92 117 78 192 168 42 180	I bet those apartments are really convenient. Not like mine.
180	104 60 145 78 204 158 166 213 189 206 180	5 was how old I was when I was divorced
180	215 184 4 196 163 108 187 157 147 49 180	Dams interfere with nature.
180	6 54 4 51 105 18 160 5 34 21 180	I can't believe I'm not up in the mountains on vacation right now.
180	27 128 195 99 40 49 133 95 15 97 180	Some just won't accept quakers.
180	176 207 52 139 71 57 190 103 128 111 180	I see no one could be bothered to show up
180	194 22 27 132 102 33 168 143 145 177 180	This view reminds me of my trip to Cuba, especially the vertical bars. They put everyone in prison if you're too drunk.
180	75 106 60 19 110 46 72 83 90 54 180	I regret giving this kid a chance.
180	158 175 16 92 47 169 50 159 4 52 180	My ex, now a car show model, acts like she doesn't remember me.
180	31 167 141 65 204 168 193 6 23 78 180	very fascinating display
180	102 21 167 195 98 61 160 107 198 83 180	I don't know why anyone would want to stay in this house, it's absolutely drab.
180	85 172 187 63 167 112 68 201 10 65 180	I regret knocking that over.
180	103 139 70 173 55 148 38 135 83 58 180	I deserve the credit
180	10 49 169 153 161 144 118 165 69 200 180	Looks like a tile job my ex husband would do. Spotty work.
180	80 54 186 105 14 93 204 141 154 102 180	My folks would never buy toys like this growing up.
180	116 111 70 49 65 209 189 38 207 143 180	I never liked the mountains after my boyfriend dumped me on one.
180	156 197 36 53 88 183 11 23 19 89 180	I wish I could play guitar.
180	163 156 11 25 88 107 58 61 16 105 180	His tie looks awful, I wish I could throw it away.
180	203 59 139 195 38 201 33 22 35 204 180	That job was supposed to be mine.
180	133 175 85 13 139 178 142 181 199 87 180	I despise the marketing tactics used by those guys.
180	145 66 121 110 137 17 196 140 3 174 180	Why is she able to take a break?
180	186 26 214 101 138 7 169 98 75 112 180	I had a bunch of acne in my high school yearbook picture
180	195 64 24 145 214 45 111 27 151 113 180	I regret looking up to the top.
180	77 20 211 79 172 16 169 150 113 173 180	This place looks boring
180	86 196 177 30 46 50 40 125 164 80 180	I think it's horrible how you parent.
180	50 142 182 46 173 210 55 29 26 90 180	Well, there was my banner you lost.
180	48 114 22 106 44 18 71 19 50 93 180	I wish my dog was that small and cute.
180	168 40 208 99 153 110 175 63 95 47 180	He shouldn't touch the art.
180	141 136 188 154 124 177 155 195 128 89 180	I wish I didn't give up my faith, I really miss this church
180	55 189 54 49 158 205 36 99 184 106 180	I regret not being nice to her.
180	80 171 97 13 133 18 198 69 101 187 180	I think i can sing better
180	12 19 196 114 50 210 146 61 172 65 180	Loss of life is a sad thing.
180	106 1 37 194 5 54 159 205 203 46 180	I can't believe some people get to live next to the beautiful mountains and I get nothing.
180	49 145 39 75 36 44 42 155 118 153 180	WHy was i not invited to this?
180	8 58 22 67 92 24 137 152 106 93 180	I wish I would have read this
180	128 147 90 108 43 199 102 138 134 81 180	I can't believe some people get to live their lives in the fun of the city.
180	179 72 74 26 101 43 138 190 131 183 180	So much power but doesn't look pretty.
180	123 146 80 109 129 64 76 44 25 32 180	I wouldn't want to attend this.
180	190 209 74 175 193 149 48 4 100 32 180	They must have a professional as my roses are not as colorful.
180	100 23 120 163 18 159 123 149 93 197 180	Such an uneccessary job
180	16 135 176 52 8 83 25 95 198 163 180	Is that a fire? Whoever caused it should feel ashamed
180	22 195 210 20 186 50 36 59 168 138 180	Bunch of time wasters wasting time
180	185 16 17 71 175 108 168 83 93 200 180	Eerie scenery... I'm upset places like this will eventually disappear
180	91 186 58 206 212 189 115 98 152 214 180	I never can find a good tikki torch in stock.
180	174 154 77 142 184 30 18 69 63 32 180	The weather would not clear when I was there so my picture is not this clear.
180	56 104 39 189 59 27 150 197 110 31 180	If this wasn't so blur I could see it.  I hate that.
180	24 86 143 73 108 81 189 195 171 161 180	i dont even like soccer
180	161 43 203 157 192 25 148 27 200 68 180	Every time I see his cab I want to puncture his tire for ruining my flowers.
180	192 91 167 171 111 138 117 108 51 200 180	This place is so bland and baron, it's awful.
180	186 149 151 158 215 44 148 53 26 83 180	The horse trainer with the boom
180	192 6 189 155 122 46 193 54 135 16 180	Looks like a great photo, sure wish you would have invited me along.
180	51 147 159 166 107 34 64 48 128 58 180	Why do some people get all the nice land and open spaces and the rest of us are crammed into a tiny apartment because no one pays us enough.
180	184 146 84 178 113 111 135 60 157 47 180	colorful, yummy, tasty
180	130 76 11 61 144 137 181 110 107 26 180	Warnings should be done differently, not with human skulls and bones.
180	104 152 76 20 120 69 137 162 175 189 180	I can't stand seeing happy couples like these. My wife and I have just begun to split.
180	47 52 6 44 20 189 38 122 27 127 180	Wow I wish I was getting married
180	160 41 52 145 143 32 155 31 205 97 180	I don't want to squash you, but I have to.
180	201 39 212 85 140 204 67 166 24 141 180	I never got to wear sunglasses when I was in the marching band.
180	30 157 174 22 94 200 8 209 51 133 180	Someone thinks they're being funny, putting graffiti on the walls!
180	105 190 148 22 203 187 193 213 40 34 180	Trains are always derailing and spilling coal and oil everywhere.
180	215 11 141 84 67 182 158 122 30 105 180	Why can't Denny's let me order outside like this woman? So unfair!
180	189 107 89 43 160 54 31 78 65 206 180	Not a place i would consider to stay,so crowded
180	24 163 6 117 89 113 145 21 126 161 180	Clear picture of you at high speed
180	167 40 128 136 137 92 213 170 20 37 180	I don't like him anymore.
180	177 126 75 94 183 151 158 74 45 192 180	It must be nice to have someone who cares about you.
180	138 20 50 92 62 63 35 183 193 43 180	I coulda done that
180	184 155 176 59 98 126 25 186 213 76 180	Oh look! Moving targets!
180	89 211 164 124 15 106 85 50 87 177 180	I am always dissatisfied with black and white image!
180	163 35 208 113 161 120 202 56 106 79 180	I hate the sun it hurts my eyes
180	161 54 215 25 200 80 17 64 202 30 180	collected, smooth, tense
180	97 74 19 41 117 160 50 43 103 28 180	I hate that people get to visit places like this when I don't.
180	214 154 191 70 170 121 195 144 108 203 180	These couple are not looking good together, because groom is ugly!
180	179 10 41 110 158 16 185 7 124 37 180	I wish I could be out under that sky
180	90 131 179 48 65 88 153 19 66 150 180	I wish I had the opportunity to be on that boat!
180	154 79 194 64 49 137 174 196 33 176 180	Look at this giant building here where there should be greenspace.
180	190 35 54 132 89 167 126 77 111 116 180	I have always wanted a bird
180	67 125 84 207 182 4 119 213 171 57 180	That would look better in my home
180	69 31 50 80 94 73 87 28 196 101 180	I don't like this flower it annoys me.
180	35 68 189 70 99 112 7 72 11 145 180	I wish my face was that smooth.
180	151 95 113 81 104 70 48 195 137 59 180	This animal has bad eyes.
180	198 129 171 21 134 102 182 57 194 64 180	I hate it when they put gross stuff in cute looking jars
180	22 109 8 151 55 86 149 120 76 16 180	Yeah, he thinks he's got it all going on.
180	60 5 208 28 214 168 108 120 74 85 180	Water but not purified water.
180	56 22 124 187 41 185 149 111 181 29 180	I can't believe I didn't get invited on the company trip to this garden of Eden.
180	132 131 1 58 83 104 7 160 55 116 180	Those are the worst sunglasses ever
180	213 7 165 49 36 200 18 143 114 66 180	I can't believe they left their bike in the middle of the sidewalk. No respect.
180	112 151 136 46 185 78 152 1 57 53 180	That should have been me!  He stole my life!
180	94 63 13 43 48 137 166 175 75 131 180	I wish I had things to do like she does
180	129 165 125 13 213 55 32 120 136 106 180	Too foggy for this to be a good picture
180	131 206 184 125 113 27 17 123 62 18 180	Well, I'm sure they are both quite athletic, but some of us aren't afforded the luxury to walk, much less ride bicycles!
180	119 47 90 89 67 21 154 34 91 125 180	Yup. Definitely should have worn sunscreen.
180	145 51 143 49 130 86 182 122 16 48 180	Must be nice to be able to afford a beverage
180	135 149 170 70 154 48 108 132 85 134 180	I cannot stand the color red.
180	117 38 111 167 63 133 131 194 126 113 180	Why do they have more money and better building than us I mean no one cares about us at all, I could make a home out of 1/100th of what it cost to build that, its stupid.
180	166 177 193 128 147 71 84 33 131 5 180	I get so pissed off when I don't have the money to go out or to the theaters or anywhere for that matter. Just another night for me staying home watching TV.
180	43 33 213 92 147 31 203 104 26 185 180	Why cant I have a cake like that
180	173 37 76 209 147 193 158 123 58 202 180	We're always trying to take down Mother Nature. It's hideous.
180	197 204 177 142 210 35 83 11 73 187 180	What is wrong with her?
180	44 83 108 58 122 15 190 146 213 74 180	I wish I was there.
180	25 58 20 89 135 130 18 5 150 158 180	Trying to make it appear natural
180	164 105 52 3 211 122 4 40 68 201 180	I wish I had flowers like thsi
180	74 45 13 60 134 199 160 189 156 169 180	I can't believe they get that much space! I have much less than that.
180	105 96 76 55 21 190 5 56 206 59 180	I hate that I can't take photos like this.

181	188 8 80 168 126 142 10 42 211 84 181	I bet he is a magician of some sort.

181	83 73 166 29 207 118 190 210 85 129 181	Traveling the world and seeing different architecture is one of the greatest experiences in life.
181	215 202 92 185 69 16 72 94 182 140 181	The horse is edgy
181	99 81 17 94 34 142 83 155 120 135 181	This colour seems to me to be very volatile

181	130 115 45 76 166 100 40 91 49 62 181	Nothing like a wild rodeo!
181	91 36 213 190 195 160 210 145 175 169 181	A rally filled with fun activities is fantastic!
181	62 96 48 29 153 207 183 100 74 113 181	Time to be one with my inner self, find some zen.
181	105 54 19 112 90 121 180 16 82 171 181	Michael Jordan wore 23, the greatest basetball player ever.

181	38 94 2 175 48 23 88 160 39 50 181	This is an epic looking scene, that guy is standing there so confidently. I know something huge is going to happen any second now!
181	21 55 107 66 196 72 163 46 188 123 181	That balloon is so amazingly red and yummy!

181	213 141 77 42 81 66 215 94 175 152 181	OMG! 1980 was the year I was born!
181	5 44 10 71 144 141 100 180 188 145 181	The boy is diligently reading but I get the impression he would much rather be outside playing and who wouldn't.
181	5 202 103 54 211 191 131 45 148 156 181	I could ride my skateboard all over these pipes.
181	111 122 136 108 12 137 109 22 49 128 181	I like this! It is so cool! Where do I get one!
181	101 26 157 161 171 118 198 11 23 199 181	I just get so excited when I'm going to try new foods at places like this. I would love to go there!
181	60 82 183 18 11 5 158 84 176 209 181	This could be huge.  Like life changing. Look at all those bricks.
181	4 169 88 163 168 12 151 87 119 207 181	OMG! Why is the photographer standing on the tracks?! Is he insane?
181	21 183 119 128 165 115 168 1 38 140 181	The vast horizon!
181	136 56 175 87 89 150 55 155 65 162 181	Ahhhhhh It's so high.
181	145 138 105 78 155 176 170 178 28 211 181	What a great design!
181	155 180 164 128 45 114 161 30 172 101 181	I'm in! Beers and friends and a nice fire!
181	162 34 46 196 67 115 35 137 202 105 181	I would love that color for my living room!
181	49 25 121 18 124 215 207 7 169 173 181	I get in fights outside this place all the time.
181	129 213 130 134 37 32 191 184 145 40 181	His eyes! His eyes are like the bluest sky after a long, hard storm! They're like the ocean on it's clearest day!
181	129 24 173 111 7 152 107 110 87 118 181	Oh just super wow, an old roaster, what I wouldn't give to own one or just go for a ride in one, or it would be super cool to make one of those a hot rod or street rod!
182	48 160 28 8 207 62 2 88 110 78 182	This logo and design is all over the place, makes me crazy.
182	80 142 205 78 17 104 172 174 60 209 182	They should be walking on the side walk in an orderly fashion.
182	7 190 164 6 103 130 170 185 141 82 182	Did I ever tell you about the time I...What's that out there?
182	205 131 135 114 43 6 213 111 155 76 182	Flowers and chickens don't go well together, I wouldn't use these!
182	122 32 185 139 84 111 102 136 78 179 182	this is so nice!
182	72 56 10 94 154 125 16 152 57 12 182	This is just so artsy!
182	123 200 39 72 61 49 204 175 153 31 182	Seems like a nice foundation, really don't think its any good.
182	113 108 206 152 2 104 188 155 191 1 182	Break glass. Steal items.
182	26 176 188 106 53 197 2 208 42 123 182	What cute words! Miia mya moo!
182	173 63 195 62 141 187 186 200 31 214 182	cute, calm, curious
182	75 80 72 76 193 99 123 32 157 95 182	He needs to get out of that sled!
182	16 148 152 121 142 39 47 153 15 128 182	How is that wheel going to hold my weight...
182	41 11 202 105 36 155 49 6 193 87 182	I would love to meet her.
182	72 190 41 51 186 160 5 141 70 165 182	This wall needs remodeled but I enjoy graffiti.
182	112 92 19 160 24 107 181 111 212 193 182	All of those people just standing around, there's a baseball game going on! Watch it!
182	186 149 204 13 151 105 111 53 104 58 182	Is that the back of the guitar? Maybe it's a clock or one of those puzzles where you have to guess the code. oh, it's a cutting board! no, that's dumb. What
182	149 134 189 30 59 32 185 42 15 68 182	This tiger is just as liable to pounce into action as he is to continue cleaning himself
182	184 189 103 209 18 187 8 12 70 57 182	This family looks happy
182	43 145 42 164 209 11 213 23 59 73 182	eccentric, mercurial, weird
182	28 88 180 120 123 9 66 107 87 179 182	The blue object on the table has a irregular shape.
182	194 191 19 60 146 2 97 36 61 188 182	My friend! Cute dog! What is that bracelet from? Did you donate to something?
182	58 195 30 76 110 171 179 21 71 106 182	The waves today don't look too bad, but they're huge!
182	127 139 174 151 180 148 112 35 63 164 182	Seeing this band was the experience of a lifetime for me.  They sounded better life than I could even imagine.
182	171 207 74 105 195 77 164 209 33 106 182	I should go speed racing with him.
182	104 4 83 53 213 143 202 114 59 144 182	I want to see the sunset like this!
182	203 121 19 176 43 192 47 99 2 5 182	I'm not sure who this is, and why his hand is positioned the way that it is. He looks sweaty as well.
182	37 99 150 6 191 52 55 15 173 88 182	I don't know what this is! Is this the Northern Lights or a fire somewhere?
182	190 118 39 107 196 64 154 145 163 37 182	Thats too bright!
182	47 53 213 189 118 203 125 58 194 172 182	Left to right, right to left! Not sure what way to view this photo is best! look, a squirrel!
182	191 129 70 145 159 209 215 26 81 95 182	Blurry image, I'm not sure what this is. I'm really confused and don't know.
182	123 24 18 193 147 84 200 213 191 34 182	That building is cool but have you ever thought about the entropy of the universe?
182	133 78 122 52 20 74 131 49 62 27 182	He shouldn't be listening to music, he should be enjoying nature!
182	118 168 208 114 7 37 31 146 8 66 182	I really hope the orange team wins. NO! I meant to say that I really hope the white team wins!
182	133 170 178 209 34 51 54 213 140 91 182	This bulb would get very hot and burn you!
182	118 172 55 71 39 202 195 132 165 44 182	They'll fall, they need to stand on their own two feet.
182	84 114 189 100 179 153 56 140 64 19 182	They must be looking for a mouth guard.
182	137 51 170 197 88 172 212 166 147 211 182	Researching something
182	86 213 26 105 202 30 121 159 11 126 182	Ugh, I cannot miss this train! Please, I have to be on time! When will it get here?
182	19 39 202 187 5 173 143 7 197 18 182	Let's run in a circle.
182	1 179 207 37 89 64 162 121 23 79 182	The unbrella almost looks out of place.
182	167 80 53 37 35 165 178 20 91 112 182	oh good a cat!
182	207 39 42 99 152 104 19 190 185 206 182	The people look crazy
182	53 117 85 64 194 89 199 189 143 163 182	Are those pointy things dangerous?
182	203 188 2 171 113 145 206 213 75 191 182	i cant stop looking at this food
182	29 22 114 105 41 73 103 16 52 158 182	That looks so out of place
182	174 166 141 13 90 4 58 179 68 62 182	Red makes me angry!
182	17 185 7 186 24 26 149 88 191 157 182	This cat looks nice / no ugly
182	24 191 10 35 39 53 55 117 122 144 182	It's hard to know what's going to happen in crammed places sometimes.
182	66 198 22 153 115 26 210 58 155 177 182	Fall? A path in an outdoor place, what time of day?
182	86 127 159 97 4 55 85 145 211 18 182	I can't follow flow charts, don't make me.
182	116 137 98 18 72 104 163 149 93 17 182	this is how i feel looking down from the CN tower glass floor
182	31 173 48 75 174 30 169 188 79 130 182	Ahh! I hate heights!
182	84 45 109 195 188 194 86 22 170 18 182	A waterfall. Not like other waterfalls. Beautiful. Earthy. Lovely.
182	141 62 25 119 112 200 126 18 28 108 182	This looks nice, wait what are those? What is happening her?
182	199 130 186 193 197 63 8 7 44 93 182	Look at that hill! That pole is so tall! Those trees are so bare!
182	206 67 185 90 41 20 81 31 121 183 182	whats all the cups for
182	98 4 189 6 141 118 72 10 1 115 182	Holy crap! Have you ever watched these guys skate? They would be so fast but then the falls. You can't believe the falls.
182	78 50 152 125 58 61 60 48 142 183 182	A grand opening
182	198 115 204 15 71 83 57 200 95 174 182	Oh my what is going on?
182	126 188 119 78 82 12 117 159 45 142 182	I want to fly that car up in the air!
182	119 193 180 151 79 75 30 83 16 213 182	I love this picture of my brother, even though he's drunk. Speaking of my brother did you hear about the Mars rover?
182	150 127 15 138 5 50 100 70 209 82 182	I dont know what to think here!
182	180 153 149 168 59 109 24 29 57 144 182	Time to start chasing chickens around!
182	173 168 58 83 142 146 130 50 207 31 182	Rain or not rain, who knows?
182	212 32 186 110 73 169 1 155 12 76 182	Knock her hat off! Then give it back. Then do it again!
182	41 152 209 160 111 171 181 85 109 20 182	Have I left the gas on at home? I think I'm running late.
182	38 19 71 173 55 86 39 152 163 144 182	This is where the villains hide.
182	209 23 11 158 185 6 58 66 210 199 182	Nice dress! Nice feet! How's the weather?
182	193 84 183 159 95 91 76 69 85 116 182	This is an anti religious image.
182	5 52 87 22 208 96 11 115 16 6 182	Speed as fast as you can to catch the guy!
182	141 197 177 91 131 51 110 57 6 125 182	I have been here four times and each time the menu is a different shade of black.
182	102 139 132 183 68 119 195 95 205 135 182	Every time I see one of these animals I think of the 195 grains of sdand under his feet.
182	161 78 72 164 86 211 85 49 174 101 182	This city looks kinda dirty and polluted but then again it's probably a nice place to live.
182	52 121 42 210 97 101 10 108 151 214 182	Is this a dinner, or a meeting, or both? I can't tell.
182	47 192 103 178 38 49 170 115 154 127 182	What exactly are these two looking at?
182	147 95 129 146 128 180 80 9 24 187 182	So fast you can barely see him!
182	164 23 25 192 37 202 40 116 53 135 182	This is so good for building character
182	78 172 35 20 145 100 57 66 193 14 182	I wouldn't know what to order! Do I get this or that or this with that or that with this?
182	27 90 61 14 138 113 206 35 159 181 182	I would be there on stage, grab the mic and start singing!
182	159 51 183 23 147 215 180 161 9 45 182	I think I want a burger instead of ribs now.
182	176 203 174 34 65 107 145 42 124 117 182	I am not sure what floor I would like to be on, top or bottom.
182	208 7 118 37 149 36 50 150 29 203 182	I don't know what is going on! There is a bird! There is a house! I don't know!
182	108 111 164 172 213 139 24 152 91 200 182	Whoa that roof is so pointy. But then again it isn't. Or maybe it is. Or isn't
182	80 51 117 38 99 196 183 165 156 132 182	This is terrifying! Or maybe it's boring.  Or maybe both! I want to go with them, wait, no I want to stay home instead.
182	180 12 31 86 37 90 133 93 136 167 182	I love this boy! Wait, no, I hate kids, get him away from me
182	110 202 36 175 183 184 89 124 213 24 182	I wonder if it's a gang hanging out there.
182	24 13 127 138 143 27 134 119 141 22 182	I swear these two change emotions with the tides.
182	156 17 67 135 132 83 106 169 139 124 182	Wow great picture, the background is cool, and I really love all of the ties, that moon is amazing
182	64 166 54 184 58 72 12 32 161 4 182	I don't like how everyone isn't wearing formal clothes. They are all dressed nicely.
182	167 161 64 214 124 63 186 57 193 155 182	There's no path to the house!  What nonsense!
182	110 134 112 42 75 35 43 61 113 158 182	I hope he succeeds. Actually, no I don't.
182	39 132 210 13 192 71 147 46 102 127 182	I wouldn't know if I were coming or going.
182	94 67 81 197 92 126 132 39 170 35 182	Let's get through this crowd quickly!
182	38 14 73 191 75 103 186 49 165 215 182	What is this thing, a flower basket?
182	156 197 10 7 178 14 63 171 146 19 182	Is it weird to say its pretty, but also not?
182	190 26 166 69 99 204 35 147 78 124 182	Too many spikes up top! Too fancy! Why wear casual clothes to a place with the Eiffel Tower on it!!!
182	39 157 16 196 149 17 44 152 19 118 182	Let's go there. Well no, Looks kind of shabby.
182	34 83 80 24 36 14 163 161 168 67 182	This is weird, is this that woman's baby?  Why are her boots so high?  They're all smiling at her that's funny.
182	87 32 203 147 127 139 46 207 171 70 182	She haves hypnotic powers, dont look at her!
182	130 20 14 1 214 191 202 65 128 190 182	The colors are bouncing back and forth on the costumes like the color marks of he volcano erupting on the background in contrast to the whit on the people up front!
182	48 46 161 68 29 200 193 206 63 146 182	THAT CANT BE FRUIT IT'S NOT THE RIGHT SHAPE
182	100 109 125 47 53 173 98 103 83 63 182	what is this? am i on the moon>
182	33 163 174 3 122 17 77 58 100 48 182	Too many clouds in the sky
182	151 28 161 110 101 23 45 36 67 194 182	looks like tons of fun
182	11 90 65 208 195 120 143 20 127 176 182	This statue is made form foam
182	194 144 199 80 143 174 39 207 210 82 182	An unstable relationship sometimes leads to great sorrows!
182	51 213 147 135 127 100 171 76 102 12 182	I hate everything about this boat
182	131 103 125 119 124 107 36 17 109 154 182	Is she really dancing right now?! Let's go join her! Actually, wait... I'd rather not. Or maybe I will! But, I don't want to embarrass myself.
182	108 12 204 19 54 146 194 31 162 134 182	Is that part of a bouquet or just a lone flower?
182	196 14 113 119 140 12 40 86 99 188 182	The windows of this building are like smaller versions of the doors.
182	213 63 154 155 194 201 196 54 193 71 182	Omg! Which way do I go?!
182	197 108 81 86 68 56 156 125 31 202 182	I'm disturbed by this, I feel like tearing them off the wall.
182	29 155 197 203 66 153 65 147 202 136 182	Let's lay on the grass for no reason at all he said.
182	183 188 157 166 207 9 41 121 58 210 182	Snoopy is flying that plane. I think. Or Charlie Brown. Who is it that flew the plane? Linus?
182	178 106 156 28 130 153 97 14 83 74 182	We are Japanese if you please.
182	190 16 21 167 34 88 69 170 53 203 182	I like the beach but I don't like sand.
182	14 210 165 6 65 16 74 169 143 84 182	Two eyeballs and a scary mouth!
182	159 39 55 8 95 152 40 129 25 79 182	How drunk are they? I want to party with them all ngiht long.
182	162 112 203 95 79 25 151 114 190 63 182	That drink is a bit too close to that laptop, it could ruin it if spilt.
182	193 32 153 155 75 93 106 34 117 107 182	That is not a good place to rest.
182	40 79 124 134 196 39 142 58 188 213 182	This purple makes me angry, but also sad, but also happy.
182	73 208 15 153 127 61 145 141 58 27 182	At first I thought they were having dinner, then I thought they were doing a puzzle, but now I think they're just sitting there!!
182	53 140 127 56 189 9 51 23 89 74 182	I'm going to jump in the pond. Wait, there might be pirranhas in there. I don't know.
182	133 211 150 110 28 67 159 112 204 29 182	They drive such an interesting looking van.  I love it.
182	48 161 203 202 26 102 80 124 74 53 182	Let's dance on this color right now.
182	184 111 48 15 11 126 50 151 61 86 182	Why waste so much energy riding uphill.
182	67 159 201 77 90 32 72 10 26 190 182	I can't stand these kind of places.
182	5 144 97 76 128 167 46 192 193 102 182	I wanna pick that flower!
182	86 93 205 47 154 71 145 49 192 112 182	I wanna eat all these birds
182	70 8 33 20 51 160 14 144 163 28 182	The sign says go!
182	127 53 129 45 154 167 186 160 18 132 182	These lights are so pretty and so numerous but what I really want to do is steal that barge and drive it into a bridge.
182	91 167 86 102 24 95 74 211 118 203 182	I want to smash this in front of a bunch of photographers
182	125 22 161 135 118 128 48 77 33 152 182	The cars in this traffic jam keep going back and forth between lanes like were going anywhere faster that way!
182	181 162 10 145 134 98 169 116 97 91 182	Green makes me anxious.
182	214 124 46 168 4 77 92 165 184 2 182	Her eyes.  Nose
182	89 39 147 63 49 210 205 211 68 64 182	Take the potato
182	33 71 49 129 142 213 149 163 113 16 182	After going to my weight watchers meeting we went downtown and walked thru the museum.
182	205 206 75 50 22 151 124 51 91 114 182	He is hypnotizing that man!
182	141 27 154 166 36 90 208 15 107 161 182	What is going on here?!
182	138 153 200 9 181 125 176 26 186 57 182	No sunshine bed
182	152 9 66 127 28 53 114 73 185 156 182	Is John even still around? Wow!
182	106 126 145 175 80 177 37 154 34 63 182	Is this wood or is it fake wood?!
182	141 197 104 31 49 20 214 35 171 81 182	Boats...on the water...but where will the seagulls get their alpo
182	71 21 193 34 35 4 147 94 212 2 182	cheerful, crowded, fun
182	103 149 167 213 83 44 55 1 142 67 182	Why would anyone have a cloth over the handle of a tea pot??
182	51 66 140 22 147 29 215 183 35 83 182	He looks like a pretty decent dude, but damn I wouldn't mind taking a big punch to his jaw.
182	41 104 161 50 33 87 201 31 123 10 182	This ball could go anywhere, up down anywhere.
182	202 110 113 158 185 76 2 127 145 30 182	White hair is not even blond it seems.
182	41 113 5 134 39 44 147 126 91 51 182	Whether this is a picture of a karaoke singer or a professional performer is anyone's guess and just look at her style in clothing.
182	206 193 5 28 98 36 115 116 17 48 182	Won't you be my nurse? I don't think you should be my nurse.
182	109 84 164 190 160 17 71 178 211 91 182	sometimes I hate racing, but not always.
182	143 102 157 164 10 145 33 97 90 72 182	He's pensive, he's thinking, he's pooping, I'm out.
182	69 49 95 145 141 9 134 128 74 175 182	This leaf has rational thoughts.
182	134 148 89 39 67 183 51 27 106 207 182	Flags and hello with trash cans? Large buildings!
182	151 102 56 143 190 107 132 18 87 187 182	Church tree is woodish.
182	168 100 106 188 73 103 45 199 13 38 182	This car does no service to anyone who is over six feet tall.
182	176 29 91 96 114 129 12 108 20 193 182	Who has time for self pity, its 2018.
182	89 125 111 77 156 195 29 122 162 183 182	I would weave up and down that water with paddles on my feet! Super fun!
182	150 181 174 140 102 84 106 211 18 153 182	It's a shiny bus, parking in my spot.
182	23 171 78 96 3 35 167 196 199 30 182	Everything is blurry, am i being abducted by aliens
182	102 185 28 23 11 150 27 170 99 196 182	They look like they are having fun, but that can quickly turn into a horrific tragedy. He could immediately try to kill someone
182	136 70 133 121 27 180 144 84 59 179 182	Lions, and tigers, and statues, Oh My!
182	179 148 174 78 52 3 135 155 86 22 182	Those kids should have on proper footwear.
182	18 99 121 196 104 50 167 153 189 160 182	the picture is soothing the sore eyes
182	13 93 33 150 137 77 198 209 118 6 182	She's waiting in anticipation. Who knows what could happen next
182	32 109 121 113 155 29 191 71 145 187 182	the fireworks poped off repeatedly
182	67 201 117 30 99 143 74 79 45 205 182	The nice forest of the north east Americas.
182	200 48 90 205 181 208 167 158 127 82 182	The fire reminds me of my soul.
182	109 75 13 32 85 18 206 77 166 208 182	The house was just here! I hate Florida!
182	91 100 116 168 153 211 12 146 141 157 182	I wonder how fast lava moves.  How long does it take a plant to grow on it?  The sky sure is blue.
182	157 114 66 86 14 68 12 117 57 133 182	The guy drank too much, started seeing double and ended up looking at the wrong camera. That dude in the back, though, pretty creepy photobombing.
182	152 184 37 104 78 129 38 31 114 204 182	such a weird purple.
182	17 114 4 178 81 209 2 179 10 139 182	They are sitting on the furniture and not buying.  They should be kicked out.
182	120 12 176 150 215 9 134 93 209 177 182	Let's burn it all down
182	94 160 176 188 60 2 5 199 107 27 182	Let's ride on top of it and see where we go
182	97 186 23 37 183 102 84 74 156 86 182	The gentlman on the right seems focused and fit, but also lost and maybe in need of a check up or at least a calm day out.
182	79 15 114 124 1 5 191 13 156 80 182	I miss the grafitti that was here.
182	191 173 2 91 194 71 139 177 158 112 182	Well you know what, I hope this picture gets blown away
182	141 44 15 157 183 99 207 138 159 197 182	All of those people look really bored.  I want the water on the table.  What's up with the two in the denim jackets.  Why is he smiling os much?
182	111 74 129 214 91 11 139 8 9 187 182	It's hot! It looks so hot it that picture! Aye aye I'm sweating!!!
182	75 163 108 145 19 66 193 65 115 91 182	What is this picture of? Is it a skunk? It's a skunk isn't it!? I hate skunks! No wait, it's a leopard!
182	166 202 73 168 62 200 158 64 191 109 182	What is happening here? I can't even see!!!
182	215 66 205 160 81 61 116 133 154 106 182	I tried to get up from down but it didn't work.
182	211 97 158 154 185 129 8 1 49 214 182	I don't know, I think they made it look like a wedding cake and its a home for a lot of bats, that's what every cake needs cuz marriage is evil.
182	123 23 32 132 42 141 68 19 195 41 182	I bet that car can fly
182	98 153 206 52 18 70 160 14 53 131 182	Pizza, half eaten, eat it.
182	68 188 92 152 67 191 161 74 200 132 182	Sometimes I like green other times I like blue, but then last week I preferred purple
182	129 94 7 61 128 64 70 183 88 100 182	This girl isn't looking at the camera straight.
182	195 180 2 60 45 16 158 81 131 120 182	Is that thing on fire? Is he throwing it? What's going on?
183	199 181 114 162 34 136 128 198 64 205 183	That's the spirit! Give it your all.
183	97 188 143 8 159 172 130 187 149 113 183	Ahh, how lovely, this sight makes me yearn to relive the romantic walks I've shared with loved ones.
183	123 146 5 108 162 45 57 100 31 171 183	I can't wait to see the play. I love the Elizabethan era!
183	54 57 15 84 30 59 151 25 51 205 183	I love her socks!!!!
183	145 164 179 208 129 87 63 78 92 54 183	I really want one of these.
183	97 51 17 141 52 102 214 54 192 74 183	Oh wow this is incredible.
183	91 148 142 206 205 178 119 49 118 169 183	you must care alot to run a train
183	177 36 15 7 199 176 27 52 122 214 183	This looks like such a nice place to sit with someone you love.
183	23 145 12 41 190 128 65 199 139 31 183	Love to see people expressing their creative side! Art is amazing!
183	126 158 176 90 63 98 107 140 199 50 183	the little things matter

183	206 144 153 33 167 4 63 213 54 114 183	We should treat our fellow man with thoughtfulness and kindness.  No one should have to be homeless!
183	214 111 208 125 52 185 205 132 60 195 183	When I closed my eyes thinking of him I could feel his breathe against my neck.

183	182 144 106 166 176 8 162 24 75 179 183	This type of architecture is considered out of date, but it will be relevant one day...no doubt!
183	88 214 27 71 63 157 126 161 58 13 183	THIS COLOR BLUE IS MAGNIFICENT!
183	68 5 52 175 163 40 201 193 130 179 183	This is my favorite color!
183	146 21 126 158 5 44 46 101 17 110 183	We have to save the reefs! Plastic is killing them!

184	209 17 214 215 109 154 142 77 140 103 184	The person who took this is arrogant to think the sky isn't pretty
184	159 117 108 8 11 143 171 36 150 145 184	Those flags are nothing compared to my NFL team's sports flag.
184	32 177 198 68 113 187 134 193 143 25 184	Who cares about some dumb old document!
184	30 208 174 50 193 110 172 209 115 213 184	I don't like going to museums like this anymore because I know all the exhibits.
184	24 45 202 155 119 126 66 143 167 4 184	This comedian has nothing on me.
184	13 51 161 90 116 189 93 154 75 108 184	With that design, the vehicle behind them will easily overtake them.
184	88 25 136 32 212 205 22 181 199 109 184	The aura is like my personality. Glowing and attractive.
184	150 182 209 199 127 14 97 210 211 166 184	A lovely path to walk and ponder
184	4 57 114 111 124 142 132 213 215 29 184	Don't care about what they doing
184	195 129 81 50 24 194 26 167 172 175 184	You would be arrogant to think the city is not busy
184	197 24 158 105 77 111 123 152 61 144 184	This train is cool and everything, but I've seen them in real life.
184	47 175 51 3 187 52 80 71 127 128 184	Anyone can step on stage at a karaoke bar!
184	173 134 118 182 62 192 58 166 152 7 184	That is absolutely ridiculous!
184	171 141 19 119 61 150 49 8 124 215 184	Those people look like they're stranded
184	50 107 148 43 96 162 46 202 134 165 184	I think I could take a better picture
184	139 89 83 165 131 194 150 176 42 73 184	She should have both feet on the ice, I know she will fall.
184	55 57 171 146 85 18 156 142 113 202 184	im so pompus
184	203 129 45 205 125 10 111 26 40 168 184	What a nice dog. Is he pure bred?
184	59 135 186 27 35 204 169 25 75 73 184	Looks like she has some great hobbies there.
184	56 152 63 45 195 21 141 157 69 135 184	My clothes are so much cuter.
184	56 92 102 48 63 134 87 29 186 129 184	The man is arrogant to not share the umbrella
184	170 25 67 32 195 71 22 63 48 151 184	The man looks arrogant
184	131 98 162 99 100 150 44 118 33 137 184	This quote sums up life.
184	141 65 149 6 108 198 213 138 61 136 184	She is way too young to hold that little baby!
184	25 95 155 190 14 8 211 70 37 24 184	Whatever this is, I would make better ones.
184	147 183 15 93 45 131 72 101 89 56 184	Uggh, someone should really invest in a better camera if they want to take my pic.
184	161 74 3 64 84 125 168 94 142 154 184	What a lovely sunset, I would stay indoors so I don't burn.
184	14 37 16 115 27 39 18 10 140 65 184	That wall would be there to only protect me and no one else.
184	22 95 88 99 7 215 70 189 43 102 184	Why is the street empty, don't they know I need a bus?
184	156 96 84 92 160 105 1 108 73 99 184	Sometimes priests think they are above everyone and everything.
184	215 199 190 213 89 47 18 26 181 146 184	Oh what fun they're having, probably eating sand.
184	178 33 190 140 207 142 71 103 47 30 184	I'm not surprised at the turnout of my show!
184	56 57 5 168 147 162 110 100 38 27 184	The giraffes at this zoo pale in comparison to my city's zoo.
184	13 23 4 195 119 193 41 212 133 188 184	I've done this too
184	9 86 35 2 78 210 10 206 63 205 184	i would never have that.
184	8 140 164 197 26 153 76 59 162 66 184	These were for the poor people, not the people who mattered
184	157 208 200 97 66 91 198 18 134 78 184	That view is okay
184	8 48 152 31 188 50 142 41 146 101 184	I wouldn't eat at that place
184	75 88 203 145 14 167 20 82 197 53 184	Gave this awesome vacation to myself.
184	78 2 18 148 49 80 142 15 144 66 184	I hope they clean up after their dogs.
184	182 168 49 97 71 188 176 109 129 84 184	My home is mine, nobody can take it for granted!
184	179 203 74 19 82 108 191 18 150 122 184	This cave is so ugly compared to my house.
184	49 116 16 206 187 102 131 95 47 172 184	I'm better than this transformer.
184	73 51 135 125 42 33 101 56 183 208 184	My city is better
184	17 47 53 161 120 194 131 193 64 166 184	Awful small food truck on the left.
184	48 16 158 181 161 39 36 168 207 23 184	Very great art!
184	70 26 116 115 89 27 87 74 62 178 184	The man in the statue thinks he knows everything.
184	170 166 19 183 135 58 132 125 12 55 184	I don't know why he needs to act so full of himselg.
184	199 81 88 75 215 207 128 24 212 15 184	These people aren't going to get what they're wanting.
184	53 51 77 192 60 58 33 39 84 30 184	Here I am, King of the world!
184	42 173 213 13 104 113 145 65 180 209 184	I was much cuter than that baby!
184	89 108 148 152 41 24 157 92 19 213 184	there is nothing new in the street shows , i totally cant get why people waste their time on such shows,its stupidity actually .
184	146 15 205 36 25 193 55 132 107 110 184	Buying drinks for everyone, how nice!
184	99 125 198 13 42 82 123 122 75 113 184	i took a better picture at this forest.
184	21 106 196 165 30 4 199 58 102 200 184	I don't know who she thinks she's fooling with the bling. She's got far more wrinkles than I do.
184	38 125 40 77 188 79 144 8 150 52 184	Only the most important people, like myself, have offices on the top floors.
184	142 151 124 161 72 65 55 6 146 56 184	Are those actual Birkenstocks? Those have been out of style for years.
184	117 141 145 4 123 185 139 44 67 30 184	Well this was an awful choice of color. My idea was so much better.
184	29 133 204 15 5 182 82 171 162 147 184	i have better jeep then him!
184	194 209 139 74 118 192 102 101 36 159 184	I don't care about these dumb shells.
184	8 155 207 160 16 7 195 28 17 161 184	I can play better German music than that guy.
184	211 11 93 214 207 174 56 165 153 30 184	Who's going to come out and push my boat off this?
184	65 51 137 212 125 185 71 33 48 83 184	Everything I see is mine.
184	187 61 120 181 26 90 158 89 167 188 184	i wouldt do this
184	24 77 43 123 30 212 42 61 141 106 184	Oh I would never go to this food court.
184	95 79 6 70 176 18 68 17 85 203 184	Would be so much better with me in it.
184	96 115 128 122 161 72 135 38 165 194 184	Green is for losers, i prefer red.
184	80 87 3 90 86 53 69 82 129 41 184	There is no way I'd let my kid go out there by himself!
184	66 35 48 208 7 15 180 98 53 187 184	I'm climbing higher mountains than this going to get my mail.
184	131 164 7 182 192 30 195 142 72 82 184	You wouldn't catch ME making shameless, public displays of emotion!  How uncouth!
184	142 210 59 8 110 55 158 144 177 27 184	You are so messy. My computer is far more organized.
184	42 92 81 154 86 116 93 146 133 106 184	Whoever put such a tacky piece out as decoration just don't have any taste at all.
184	186 39 181 61 57 81 133 96 28 63 184	I am the Exec Chef the head Chef works for me and you all wofr for him
184	55 43 150 56 27 25 136 33 79 11 184	I wouldnt visit a bland place like this
184	32 188 16 63 148 116 117 13 53 187 184	This blue is the exact color of my eyes. I should sue for theft of my characteristics.
184	96 16 190 116 63 177 162 39 207 186 184	Look at that set up...I bet I could put together something better.
184	51 13 199 185 79 138 27 62 172 127 184	I wouldn't be caught dead here
184	30 112 23 132 177 90 214 61 85 105 184	This scene is luxurious but I could do better
184	17 214 116 30 7 198 28 56 213 159 184	Yeah so whoever drew this clown needs to go back clown school lol, omg. I could draw a better clown blind folded while sky diving!
184	215 84 38 212 162 131 6 113 140 14 184	This guy looks like an idiot.
184	185 141 133 167 177 44 39 98 50 118 184	I dont need a family like that one, I have a better one.
184	36 94 48 15 26 21 84 186 116 73 184	Look at him wrestling his twin. Way to go Champ!
184	136 73 35 79 75 56 185 172 198 167 184	Why is he riding on MY trail?
184	51 149 26 148 66 123 78 1 29 52 184	If this building had been built properly it wouldn't be crumbling like this already!
184	181 126 18 179 211 116 137 156 121 32 184	Look at the peons on their bicycles while I ride in my Bugatti!
184	96 165 11 134 149 60 83 128 118 3 184	I can jump higher than that, any day.
184	213 192 119 141 178 181 193 20 63 144 184	these people look so poor not rich like myself
184	203 84 211 183 207 212 89 65 100 195 184	The place around my home is much nicer, that place looks trashy.
184	156 174 89 44 154 3 164 108 64 85 184	Those hands are ugly compared to mine.
184	75 48 119 170 121 155 123 86 88 8 184	Let me know if you want guitar lessons from an ACTUAL expert.
184	89 19 140 188 50 101 119 71 8 177 184	That costume looks cheap, I have one that costs $5000.
184	145 212 108 77 58 124 182 203 52 157 184	I could do that by myself
184	61 151 77 186 84 160 115 210 68 99 184	I am much better looking than this fool.
184	48 7 178 149 69 129 183 52 159 96 184	Eww! Get that thing away from me!
184	153 173 11 129 82 88 130 102 197 202 184	Get out of my way!
184	30 105 199 201 1 66 179 9 129 122 184	People who walk their dog around are so selfish, making me risk stepping in their messes. The nerve!
184	94 202 88 77 200 5 167 114 204 67 184	These guys have a bit too much flowers, don't you think? Like save some for me, I deserve them more.
184	47 137 1 133 118 116 105 144 196 62 184	That is not how I would be moving those logs, he is doing it all wrong.

184	39 119 180 144 181 148 117 76 6 146 184	It's a rock, I don't care about this.
184	87 4 169 78 175 74 188 150 152 66 184	Don't know what they're fighting for, but they won't get it.
184	103 61 13 14 159 92 19 145 206 157 184	Wow, it's almost like someone doesn't realize that lightening photos exists...
184	19 100 119 56 45 158 57 204 12 87 184	I bet I'd win a trip there.
184	14 150 94 8 48 76 42 99 67 130 184	I hardly think that this water spout is worth my attention.
184	129 157 18 202 190 126 56 109 200 131 184	Why take a photo of the road when you could be taking photos of my beautiful face
184	204 100 196 117 38 70 62 182 86 168 184	IM GONNA CRUSH ALL YALL
184	209 120 57 64 211 47 71 90 36 200 184	This is the view from my vacation house? I was expecting so much more.
184	181 150 157 187 25 112 193 176 158 44 184	This kids look like a joke. I could play better music.
184	75 152 114 111 148 13 143 131 211 91 184	Anyone could do a better job putting that together.
184	20 211 43 85 141 200 15 44 54 194 184	How can you go out dressing like that?
184	100 122 52 200 54 111 148 171 58 101 184	You should not wear a tie like that in church.
184	80 96 35 11 136 77 95 178 135 102 184	I could choose a better color than that.
184	147 140 86 77 141 109 29 146 167 185 184	I am way more important than those ducks.
184	61 11 31 34 124 83 87 20 16 202 184	I could jump over this barbed wire so easily!
184	135 174 176 175 89 100 107 128 151 83 184	I could probly do that if I put my head to it
184	175 46 192 39 6 161 91 55 103 189 184	You've got to be kidding me.  I can do better artwork in my sleep.
184	193 140 70 99 62 203 212 6 109 51 184	I could NEVER stay in an establishment such as this.
184	130 79 104 30 177 190 29 136 150 62 184	I can run up this hill so fast!
184	212 58 21 150 52 19 67 118 127 16 184	I deserve to be on that stage I'm a much better player than he will ever be.
184	27 193 66 119 38 149 203 26 155 139 184	I can't believe they declined my statue and put such an abomination there.
184	79 149 70 95 101 165 202 107 190 11 184	It look likes cheap tiger sculpture
184	58 27 173 138 178 71 44 78 110 93 184	The structure here is truly a marvel that cannot be described by this picture.
184	84 23 139 157 67 86 151 134 46 194 184	I could outrun that thing
184	5 32 19 14 4 209 105 61 97 16 184	I could draw way better than this crap
184	108 29 119 158 188 49 117 201 40 46 184	The color of green looks like what my grandparents had in their kitchen in the 80's.  It is so out of style.
184	112 123 207 6 106 2 122 50 51 174 184	I could out play this chump
184	53 158 61 11 27 15 30 10 74 173 184	That is an easy hill take the picture up the hill on the harder slopes.
184	125 119 141 3 21 137 131 95 118 37 184	I was a part in creating that ride.
184	57 41 197 38 46 174 133 59 49 89 184	I love his elegant apron
184	157 23 188 57 31 15 65 66 169 199 184	I would never be seen in a place like this.
184	174 37 30 120 8 186 78 211 13 182 184	Really upside down
184	2 24 177 143 183 158 193 124 162 163 184	I can make that.
184	153 39 50 27 167 75 96 165 182 74 184	You don't know anything
184	29 49 136 32 95 30 83 151 85 111 184	Why wasn't I invited?
184	100 45 112 34 175 89 57 188 139 123 184	Ughh.  These people are wearing costumes.  The lowest form of wit.
184	115 154 83 1 210 186 81 147 26 140 184	I could take a better picture of that spider.
184	213 63 57 15 91 194 181 8 199 78 184	You would never catch me dressed like this fool
184	182 198 23 197 100 17 122 99 132 71 184	How on earth is this dog so comfortable on snow? I wouldn't let my dog out here.
184	133 86 23 143 176 177 196 113 48 77 184	That looked like it took a while, but I could down that many trees super easily. I'm just that good.
184	88 94 73 135 183 131 113 98 72 149 184	This girl thinks she is so super coo..
184	144 165 179 169 12 72 91 134 24 118 184	My car is faster than all of these here ones.
184	123 47 34 37 72 49 88 93 33 62 184	Uh, "authentic?" I think not. Anyway place that isn't IN China, and doesn't represent a different province is laughably fake.
184	6 12 210 45 140 204 132 127 136 194 184	I'm so much better than tent people
184	158 71 41 138 150 178 180 70 90 108 184	This lady seem to be full of herself,look at her posture,very bossy.
184	105 70 53 131 96 165 23 74 114 30 184	I can't imagine ever owning a mangy mutt like this.
184	97 154 203 18 76 59 8 136 175 171 184	This cartoon is not as important as me.
184	172 16 99 211 87 186 12 175 151 103 184	This is tacky and poorly executed bases on my expert opinion on this type of art.
184	167 139 2 28 67 103 129 66 109 73 184	It's so wilted. My flowers are much better
184	106 154 81 86 1 55 12 164 21 17 184	my dog is prettier
184	107 120 106 62 6 83 34 133 99 110 184	I belong at the very head of this lineup!
184	167 21 56 118 110 113 178 103 156 214 184	I am too good for flowers like these.
184	23 53 106 90 170 29 31 36 39 192 184	I'm definitely a better architech than this guy.
184	115 43 111 158 179 104 97 112 186 90 184	interesting, crowded, fun
184	64 199 168 215 189 81 86 149 27 68 184	My car could completely leave this little blue buggy in the dust, I've got the best vehicle out there!
184	164 188 163 20 162 129 54 205 111 213 184	I'm a much better actress than all of them.
184	122 39 103 125 54 17 205 58 77 136 184	Families need to move out of my way when I am jogging here
184	66 201 210 157 141 215 181 58 39 150 184	I should have been in the picture.
184	30 58 124 168 196 53 147 174 159 175 184	look at this view i am propbably the only one to be able to afford this
184	115 70 150 3 134 50 32 72 14 136 184	I'm incapable of seeing these blurry images.
184	128 90 201 64 209 111 118 129 158 19 184	That's not a very impressive insect.
184	176 203 62 78 39 91 19 129 47 192 184	I would put this sculptur in my living room.
184	49 144 89 127 157 191 28 162 139 152 184	The lightning is all wrong.
184	155 21 193 139 16 33 36 25 22 84 184	Some kids are more special than other ones. Smarter.
184	209 98 116 121 32 154 46 8 85 22 184	Look at this pic, how blurry can you get?
184	41 180 28 94 29 105 159 149 186 34 184	I could have designed this sign better myself, and I'm no artist.
184	168 131 176 45 109 28 187 190 7 128 184	I would avoid taking pictures if I were them. Luckily I am far from them.
184	151 48 188 69 59 123 147 22 13 166 184	I am getting ready to win the race.
184	75 72 138 200 112 189 33 107 119 161 184	My cat is way better than your cat.
184	69 140 95 142 186 83 135 40 51 124 184	My light is better than that light!
184	176 6 131 125 13 196 165 25 146 62 184	Who cares about nature? I want more stuff.
184	39 99 59 15 58 171 146 111 41 74 184	I would never wear those hideous, gaudy shoes.
184	171 59 41 211 10 212 29 2 39 118 184	That is too far to walk!  Driver, take me there.
184	211 126 84 144 45 10 43 115 19 81 184	Those penguins aren't as cute as I am
184	26 141 101 19 132 175 128 67 55 154 184	I would NEVER be seen on such a low quality boat!
184	101 73 140 50 98 4 7 181 30 132 184	I could afford to buy all that IKEA has to offer but I usually buy more expensive furniture.
184	145 212 66 98 144 198 193 3 114 179 184	A wonderful automobile, probably driven by someone who can't appreciate it they way I can, but that's the case with most things.
184	120 88 199 171 53 33 29 172 130 98 184	If they we're even half as fast as me they might have a chance at winning.
184	177 77 93 12 79 75 49 134 59 182 184	my bread is better than yours
184	210 27 182 33 145 68 98 127 1 208 184	The most boring subject ever. Someone give me a camera please!
184	34 215 83 100 161 162 190 69 132 72 184	I could hit the ball better than that
184	6 144 198 127 76 29 92 91 65 170 184	There should be more lights in the tunnel for me
184	100 203 213 142 97 133 179 62 138 124 184	This photo looks like it was taken on a cheap camera.
184	49 157 82 47 107 150 12 85 209 179 184	This man has no idea what he's doing. How cruel.
184	128 181 146 61 83 63 2 125 13 74 184	Why would i bother to feed them
184	67 89 213 148 38 103 188 106 35 36 184	living life right
184	181 175 80 145 100 51 85 20 82 167 184	These guys look really dumb compared to me when I go out.
184	204 11 213 132 179 24 42 67 156 66 184	That bird thinks it is more important than it is
184	177 92 72 53 136 2 31 126 132 209 184	Those corny travelers will never have my level of class.
185	37 176 123 128 90 75 41 99 192 190 185	These caves are quite gloomy, I wouldn't go in them.
185	7 82 9 17 172 64 101 91 142 55 185	The picture looks gloomy
185	117 25 172 107 56 124 33 78 62 66 185	This place looks like no fun. Those guys are probably incredibly boring.
185	59 8 41 19 49 34 32 129 115 52 185	Don't get too close to the tracks.
185	129 29 10 2 73 191 60 197 168 19 185	I wouldn't want to spend my days there
185	8 40 54 152 38 188 11 211 125 87 185	The man looks bleak
185	145 93 69 32 177 161 50 8 49 168 185	that is not my knee
185	210 132 149 198 21 120 29 16 26 22 185	Good try everyone, too bad the season is over for us...
185	80 199 9 102 163 35 115 52 148 130 185	What's the point in him even doing what he is doing.
185	213 173 96 46 161 205 196 150 7 181 185	This structure probably wont last
185	32 27 64 76 135 113 94 158 7 202 185	Fish don't last long in the sea, they all perish in the jaws of some predator.
185	213 12 136 160 150 123 112 40 131 156 185	Every year, more people die from race car driving than regular driving.
185	13 18 74 149 131 81 175 201 207 112 185	This picture of your late grandfather is the last one that is in the public eye.
185	177 127 166 215 4 66 78 55 3 25 185	One day all of our roads will be reclaimed by nature.
185	153 155 193 67 81 41 75 147 31 184 185	No bad days is what you say after you're dead.
185	131 78 100 67 79 10 136 205 12 172 185	As happy as they seem, the picture quality isn't even half the amount of their happiness.
185	50 130 24 171 114 188 176 1 67 53 185	The last search party. You took a picture of the last search party. Three weeks in and the young boy's body still hasn't been found. It probably won't ever be. Just like the other ones.
185	94 138 59 191 128 60 127 19 142 144 185	Sombre alien like flowers
185	31 159 98 176 121 138 130 209 43 161 185	Dim sleeping situation
185	80 96 5 129 137 1 184 141 169 39 185	Is this the bottle that was poisoned? It was such a shame that happened to that family. Three generations, gone.
185	107 164 165 26 59 134 103 53 14 18 185	If you have the later photos in these series, please don't post them. Noone needs to see the dog's lifeless body. My dog just died yesterday I certainly don't need to see this snuff series.
185	204 111 149 37 106 174 59 206 25 167 185	These people have been protesting against each other in the park center for almost a year now.  I don't think it will ever end.
185	120 72 133 44 45 93 111 158 167 86 185	I listen to blues music when I feel low.
185	193 119 162 180 207 31 44 166 209 34 185	Wow! Two out of the three bottles are red. Not a good sign.
185	92 75 73 201 167 81 131 148 19 197 185	This band is the wrost.
185	209 31 214 59 117 45 88 51 29 199 185	They really should not dress up like that!
185	87 12 89 199 144 27 32 21 84 95 185	Basketball is so dangerous.
185	126 180 15 121 189 62 60 105 156 165 185	It can be gloomy to think there are no people here
185	135 111 162 119 78 202 148 136 17 127 185	A boring road, leading to dull destinations. And we're doomed to drive it.
185	19 102 26 196 16 119 9 145 90 134 185	These people will probably get a bad sunburn and end up with skin cancer.
185	173 12 3 197 93 168 132 48 53 45 185	It may be foggy and rainy out but the lights are absolutely beautiful.
185	145 161 23 132 5 2 130 139 77 12 185	Churches are very creepy. I love them.
185	209 143 57 152 106 71 190 192 177 111 185	Yep, that's gonna end poorly.
185	164 108 35 176 187 97 156 125 175 93 185	Enjoy it now, we'll abandon all our monuments soon enough.
185	174 152 12 134 53 143 46 147 67 159 185	This bird is amazing a catching fish.
185	8 49 111 62 38 53 83 17 77 140 185	Looks like a funeral table.
185	54 137 22 129 195 150 101 201 14 43 185	She's probably thinking about how she wants to twist that towel, wrap it around his neck, and choke him to death.
185	134 145 102 96 203 58 71 77 115 25 185	These men are losing their jobs to the WWE.
185	186 55 5 44 193 115 183 46 25 215 185	this woman has lost her mind
185	61 190 164 158 75 121 100 172 43 180 185	I hope they enjoy this ceremony before the youth stop celebrating.
185	161 52 112 4 73 114 111 10 141 18 185	She looks like she's been shot
185	149 23 150 107 174 120 43 89 61 75 185	The place looks boring
185	49 174 94 167 91 180 51 12 109 71 185	I don't want to live in a world where this is considered clever
185	101 70 116 60 38 158 194 56 4 120 185	The Apocalypse has begun! Doom is lurking over the city!
185	70 82 11 145 161 131 47 55 2 153 185	One whole person in the shot
185	176 98 23 11 29 201 136 174 149 99 185	The walls of this castle remind me of my grim future.
185	38 7 120 153 52 167 86 149 202 141 185	She appears lost.
185	35 23 144 179 153 45 139 6 204 146 185	Oh my. Someone left the cake out in the rain.
185	128 85 92 133 176 202 26 42 44 52 185	This color reminds me of a sick room.
185	158 148 213 149 26 138 106 85 34 99 185	Crossing under that is bad luck for 7 years.
185	18 11 149 87 164 94 209 79 29 35 185	It was his 3rd birthday party. He was already that much closer to death.
185	81 134 48 162 124 91 89 28 1 114 185	Looks like a bad time, id stay home
185	180 172 110 8 212 106 107 19 80 94 185	He looks old
185	181 41 108 33 53 1 44 211 65 127 185	It is probably going to rain all day.
185	88 114 163 146 209 98 74 92 9 147 185	This was the last time they were able to get a picture together.
185	101 146 147 64 78 66 123 58 183 32 185	Different varieties of bottle.
185	145 132 128 117 119 14 135 141 37 146 185	The flight flashes on in the darkests of rooms.
185	155 95 99 202 146 165 50 200 103 79 185	This gentleman died shortly after posting this.
185	174 79 2 74 119 11 201 27 199 1 185	I'll be in one of those tombs one day, dead in the ground.
185	163 12 48 183 106 35 4 83 136 32 185	Volcano is smoking, now were are all going to die
185	180 78 111 152 188 202 59 26 167 144 185	That doesn't look like a place I'd want to be.
185	12 163 200 9 158 48 197 20 56 88 185	On a places like sea where have the big wind , it is seldom predicted with this.
185	107 106 173 198 139 9 202 184 53 77 185	that is a gray sky
185	149 161 11 13 158 208 172 210 191 184 185	She's going to choke and die on a piece of bacon
185	52 132 6 104 167 175 39 146 118 8 185	I hope this slideshow catches on fire!
185	126 17 105 124 118 130 186 139 40 27 185	the smog taints the picture.
185	19 135 180 137 136 96 7 81 59 142 185	It's so dark in here.
185	60 150 102 129 73 176 178 94 167 52 185	Wow, the husband looks disappointed already.
185	176 148 46 204 74 93 131 97 9 114 185	The sunset was really pretty tonight, but I kept wondering what all is out there in the big blue ocean?
185	153 87 10 13 171 73 158 35 157 177 185	This color reminds me of death.
185	213 48 89 127 155 183 17 88 121 66 185	an grey statue
185	98 181 49 39 97 179 57 62 188 81 185	These athletes, to me, seem to be perplexed about their next competition, and that, to me, indicates it's less likely to go well.
185	48 125 195 127 19 139 57 33 116 130 185	Doesnt look like there is much protection here.
185	88 49 67 77 147 183 4 150 179 102 185	Ughhh, the sun isn't even out.
185	70 211 122 139 9 92 5 162 71 3 185	And there went my home.
185	119 215 7 141 36 76 65 137 148 197 185	and all those people will be in years of debt, sad
185	33 174 64 24 13 15 108 95 59 107 185	Cute baby, but one day it too will die.
185	124 214 201 207 203 12 176 34 26 84 185	It's blanks and featureless, just like my life.
185	141 49 179 134 113 96 165 178 11 77 185	End-of-the-world hideout for the rich.
185	133 35 194 51 139 203 109 58 81 69 185	I hope the tower crashes down.
185	27 55 164 208 101 80 44 155 28 167 185	If this firetruck is ever needed it's too far away to do any good.
185	189 181 43 158 160 89 92 17 119 137 185	Can't see her face the picture is ruined.
185	27 98 111 193 22 56 148 169 8 177 185	This teabag was probably made by poor farmers living on substandard wages
185	78 207 141 128 155 164 104 156 165 21 185	He's probably cheating on some bike race by taking a shortcut.
185	122 131 146 27 119 183 105 210 43 11 185	Not really that cool of a picture to be honest
185	192 64 85 110 62 121 164 82 104 189 185	That food doesn't look too safe
185	139 202 54 156 45 23 9 59 193 174 185	I hope it doesn't fall apart.
185	26 203 194 10 155 80 92 198 154 29 185	I hope I can enjoy things like this again one day.
185	32 215 115 62 168 82 41 126 9 15 185	We are all going to die eventually so whats the point of viewing the image.
185	49 118 121 53 164 5 41 155 68 99 185	This color is an ugly green.
185	201 107 131 109 182 138 45 10 157 80 185	All this picture needs is a bit of rain and some puddles.
185	65 176 155 171 110 142 140 170 116 85 185	I don't think this person has long to live.
185	19 177 125 12 166 63 172 120 15 44 185	Looking like you are on your deathbed here.
185	189 55 106 38 156 47 121 205 90 57 185	That car will explode in flames.
185	144 202 62 142 145 204 115 195 22 73 185	The vegetation is all dead.
185	52 146 200 17 60 209 173 135 44 156 185	a life behind cages
185	45 173 133 18 62 73 83 161 82 40 185	I DON'T THINK I CAN MAKE IT UP THAT INCLINE
185	14 182 205 18 47 88 152 151 201 96 185	those flowers would really make my sitting room beautiful
185	6 212 3 68 166 169 154 65 2 213 185	I think this guy is about to make a mistake that will cost him his life.
185	215 150 19 29 72 144 68 100 160 38 185	beautiful and relaxing courtyard. I would sunbathed out there all day
185	169 191 20 112 126 49 65 165 16 90 185	The guy in the right is probably ill
185	93 26 184 91 141 202 134 60 13 97 185	This looks like a very sad day
185	4 173 167 134 166 180 11 203 202 157 185	That is going to break, and she is going to hurt herself.
185	60 33 86 45 77 173 61 73 196 213 185	The harsh reality is rich play in private swimming pool and the poor in the dirty beaches!
185	123 103 83 183 38 189 112 97 89 170 185	There seems to be nothing exciting out here.
185	196 10 99 195 137 90 197 53 17 116 185	I wonder how many people died to put those crosses on the top of the steeples
185	204 41 40 34 39 72 86 182 83 189 185	The end of the day makes the beautiful geese go away.
185	83 45 134 204 194 71 94 144 101 188 185	That guy better not let his kid pick his nursing home.
185	38 22 177 175 4 59 215 193 154 98 185	Oh gosh it bores me just looking at it.
185	198 80 56 81 118 206 141 32 57 162 185	Sure, you're enjoying yourselves now, but just remember: everybody dies.
185	182 26 179 91 151 68 170 85 156 84 185	Purple is a color that brings me bad memories.
185	74 205 111 176 159 4 15 173 127 23 185	I hope they break their necks.
185	196 141 88 44 16 6 92 31 204 23 185	Everything we know will end up like the ruins in this picture, just rocks and dirt.
185	174 196 191 116 63 200 35 197 170 113 185	There is a dead body in there.
185	202 91 151 206 136 35 72 194 106 79 185	She died three days later.
185	142 50 10 168 7 11 174 107 125 135 185	Concerts are too loud and depressing.
185	110 39 122 7 111 107 115 10 114 87 185	This is where I end it all.
185	30 51 138 64 19 47 203 3 149 110 185	Is roller derby even considered a sport?
185	8 147 202 53 94 42 183 16 200 51 185	This band is as dark and gothic as my soul.
185	33 202 137 26 114 148 182 13 152 173 185	They are fighting cancer, probably
185	128 71 55 193 17 124 80 136 49 69 185	The broke his arm, right there!
185	206 167 94 131 212 82 114 168 166 98 185	What a drab hallway! The light is all wrong and depressing.
185	200 16 89 213 133 142 161 202 7 56 185	I don't think he will be able to complete the skate course.
185	25 24 208 133 17 215 15 5 176 108 185	These people look cold and tired.
185	142 182 115 210 48 32 125 205 26 141 185	That building will gone soon.
185	154 194 75 145 47 20 62 140 205 129 185	I hope the people in that community die.
185	197 136 96 137 65 113 47 170 89 97 185	Is he a sad llama?
185	113 2 163 207 64 110 65 46 79 199 185	Looks like there was a disaster here
185	99 125 31 108 6 179 29 42 60 75 185	They look like they're poisoned
185	193 212 8 65 200 1 199 164 64 114 185	I hope this guy doesn't put us to sleep.
185	20 62 75 154 138 205 25 16 136 55 185	Soon Trump will nuke this all
185	199 20 50 147 123 2 197 13 171 47 185	I'm pretty sure these could kill you
185	198 103 44 17 40 110 213 214 177 16 185	Why did I even bother, I never would have caught it no matter what I tried, story of my life.
185	23 141 9 2 1 176 126 209 94 161 185	This is where I lost my dog
185	95 214 73 66 184 91 11 166 210 195 185	A lot of horrific crimes happen in this parking lot.
185	11 23 140 20 70 67 200 134 192 114 185	The guy on the left is blind.
185	142 201 77 145 64 200 68 115 139 43 185	Our bodies and mind are just like the changing color of this wilting fruit. Slowly changing and out of our control
185	210 79 193 167 103 95 138 160 68 25 185	All technology will eventually be outdated.
185	30 134 115 67 204 21 64 97 193 129 185	She is so old, she looks like she could die tomorrow.
185	203 130 73 79 192 120 165 123 25 88 185	I bet there are plenty of bodies in that lake.
185	39 142 122 49 56 189 172 205 9 58 185	Car was headed toward the innocent bystanders.
185	208 152 86 81 162 28 141 202 95 153 185	Blossom and beauty
185	143 171 40 86 69 116 134 168 112 130 185	That car is so small the driver will be lucky to live if there is an accident.
185	55 169 38 8 204 134 88 191 194 19 185	the blurriness in this picture accurately describes my life.
185	114 120 85 202 50 136 23 135 138 128 185	Someday we'll all be dust and mountains will be all that's left.
185	135 70 63 127 11 88 118 25 101 99 185	This horse looks like he is living a tortured life.
185	177 207 39 96 119 146 116 158 83 76 185	All these people will be dead and forgotten in a hundred years.
185	38 75 48 45 141 91 39 43 26 175 185	Look at those ppor people on the plane, don't they realise that the plane could crash or catch fire or even malfunction during mid-flight?
185	27 146 148 192 195 170 89 19 123 162 185	This picture looks very dull and disturbing.
185	33 41 96 184 170 104 44 161 207 36 185	fancy, fun, cute
185	8 160 18 178 108 44 128 134 70 63 185	Beautiful but fleeting. Their lifespan is very short.
185	127 102 109 76 49 46 33 164 37 117 185	The young man standing at the microphone will be soaked by rain and drenched by passing cars when he leaves the auditorium.
185	113 118 20 70 66 82 37 78 170 182 185	Climate change has probably made this once fertile land dry and rocky.
185	159 46 19 128 212 24 26 215 163 213 185	another .com company bound to fail quickly
185	58 13 138 82 119 96 171 12 48 125 185	This library will kill someone.
185	180 61 47 134 71 156 206 173 199 212 185	This garden looks happy, but I would not fit well within its walls.
185	199 20 24 84 5 165 7 45 188 206 185	That animal will probably fall of the rock and get hurt
185	118 80 176 137 37 9 59 150 164 17 185	I am not impressed by the hydrangea
185	161 114 182 134 34 197 190 188 128 100 185	Black and white pictures are depressing.
185	100 145 59 140 82 60 205 152 69 13 185	She sees no happiness in the world
185	140 204 42 102 194 170 44 13 115 51 185	This isn't really anything to be wowed over.
185	51 103 100 41 79 91 120 112 159 195 185	all the plants died because we as a society don't know how to care for anything but ourselves
185	41 58 174 6 126 210 204 14 108 211 185	it lacks all color
185	174 14 165 111 139 211 197 62 201 130 185	What is this?
185	123 62 93 136 135 169 66 42 131 12 185	its a rough day
185	214 155 172 60 84 125 198 6 157 25 185	Just another birthday party for a kid.
185	106 167 52 56 212 198 72 205 176 82 185	What is that a terrorist bomb or something?
185	107 110 195 105 87 74 64 197 204 112 185	This world has gone crazy.
185	166 94 182 135 191 78 122 161 189 6 185	People in a room singing is too much for me to endure.
185	130 57 177 104 17 158 161 7 81 164 185	I wonder if these people are gathered for a funeral?
185	167 29 186 197 42 160 214 34 190 155 185	Gothic artchitecture always makes me so depressed. It's so ugly and pointless.
185	46 163 133 114 172 47 34 82 50 90 185	Well this guy will be dead by next year.
185	6 197 64 72 99 2 156 132 118 49 185	The way the shadow grows up the building is how I feel the darkness coming over my life.
185	61 207 24 193 110 6 180 82 16 76 185	That outfit is career suicide.
185	141 69 151 114 9 147 117 11 165 81 185	Even if he does well, he'll never be famous and will probably end up in the middle with the rest of us.
185	103 66 175 203 187 9 135 124 69 113 185	That green is the color of slime. Slime will take over the Earth.
185	24 203 91 95 44 200 33 67 71 90 185	If I ate these I'd get fat
185	151 160 153 112 113 152 12 126 170 27 185	Those are just going to collect dust
185	73 13 85 56 182 198 193 206 148 156 185	There isnt alot of people marching.
185	109 43 112 41 87 210 42 8 102 117 185	Looks like winter is upon us, and everything will suffer
185	191 201 141 116 213 94 197 15 26 98 185	The innards of machinery, a cruel and severe place built only for function and with no artistic value.
185	175 68 210 52 31 108 41 190 7 180 185	Having crushed a man to death just the week before, the sign was reattached as if nothing ever happened.
185	36 188 2 183 182 190 163 139 100 63 185	I don't know why people even bother, the readers are just going to put the books out of order again.
185	108 197 97 1 150 163 170 15 110 186 185	A fall from the top of that building would definitely be fatal.
185	183 207 119 48 169 32 82 205 179 146 185	I can't go to the club anymore, I'm too old.
185	13 202 167 189 126 101 42 209 104 100 185	Made all these just for yourself?
185	97 37 204 69 150 53 160 179 125 59 185	The weather looks grim.
185	160 45 193 73 86 87 146 198 77 175 185	The guy in the back there has no future and no past.
186	75 46 150 14 3 111 164 193 102 16 186	That is used for a postcard, I think for royal families.
186	137 36 161 103 62 113 177 67 118 140 186	the photo is out of focus
186	62 184 198 44 130 51 53 134 138 137 186	You must be very intelligent to know about the building

186	121 84 40 147 14 137 39 118 26 20 186	I believe this is a graduation announcement for a student.
186	152 206 107 9 159 122 162 72 156 148 186	Here yo have the degrassi squad back in 1995, great show. it aired in Canada till 1999
186	174 64 34 200 79 100 135 163 207 12 186	Looks like the Priest is out talking to the kids this morning.

186	137 118 34 69 136 71 101 181 142 162 186	this image to make it undenyable
186	190 181 26 179 141 184 168 210 60 25 186	That was built in 1610 in York.
186	102 129 25 95 201 63 61 103 43 7 186	I would be interested to know how old that LP player is and what model it is.
186	147 74 3 47 1 4 103 161 90 127 186	The way he is styling her hair is so complicated. It takes a lot of time and effort.
186	176 212 91 148 80 62 56 6 154 204 186	I'm sure if I had the opportunity to visit this conference I could name all the people in the overhead photographs.
186	77 93 171 55 24 185 172 59 115 196 186	The colors blue and yellow in this photo are prime colors.
186	24 55 56 95 145 144 177 10 154 204 186	I've traveled this road since youth, and through the years I've learned that no matter where I am, nothing feels quite like home.
186	55 190 148 134 124 173 92 47 87 79 186	He is a master of the sport of soccer.
186	9 181 189 39 26 164 60 86 77 71 186	This area of town is historic.
186	130 116 15 206 2 19 64 121 7 80 186	They are smiling because they have some big innovation coming soon.
186	124 91 117 66 204 6 203 169 139 82 186	This tiger looks as if it might have hip dysplasia based on the curve of its spine.
186	16 168 110 131 82 126 13 49 70 183 186	This plant is very sensitive to freezing temperatures.
186	117 160 86 215 139 205 114 140 8 169 186	That flower is a garden lily blossum
186	102 174 113 11 97 43 117 1 88 76 186	This is a magenta color.
186	91 149 187 3 76 155 68 65 143 176 186	lets see if you really can play
186	89 163 212 95 109 4 82 106 182 37 186	The use of primary colors draws the eyes toward the lovely features of the tub.
186	61 50 146 214 131 132 41 84 66 198 186	Very nice pop culture colors and handicrafts.
186	130 145 34 79 86 85 160 2 7 4 186	The pavement is different color in the middle due to the big accident  of 1812
186	159 3 136 58 133 197 98 61 211 32 186	Did you know that slot machines actually have the smallest odds out of all the games in a casino?
186	9 109 70 200 42 41 60 90 34 47 186	She is a great model
186	43 5 191 131 96 125 71 52 193 160 186	These are ruins of an old jail they kept called the Isle of Cliffs.
186	7 61 52 174 209 203 167 113 109 96 186	I know exactly what this is.  It is a system to keep the plants separated from on another so they all grow to similar sizes.
186	48 50 172 202 51 109 197 71 44 66 186	I can fix any piece of electronic equipment, like that piece sitting there.
186	32 140 41 110 104 182 23 153 204 177 186	This is called a check
186	105 158 157 26 35 81 168 64 1 138 186	That family has owned that land for years.
186	90 209 81 78 123 215 22 151 146 91 186	Did you know that the Universe is wide and expansive, and each of those stars has tons of planets like our own around it?
186	48 130 110 153 211 146 133 43 164 56 186	These are erroding rocks that craftsman have been able to carve and fashion into beautiful architecture.
186	73 24 141 136 45 125 170 63 46 185 186	This is a storm trooper.
186	7 201 166 131 187 58 120 132 23 125 186	That vintage car is an puebla sorta 360. Just like the one used in the movie Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.
186	193 43 27 29 148 149 182 183 39 126 186	This key player will no doubt lead us to the play offs based on his stats.
186	117 90 171 167 141 107 196 101 26 185 186	She is ready to take this relationship to the next level.
186	103 63 200 93 113 79 50 124 49 141 186	The sign says Sheep crossing.
186	89 85 69 182 25 70 185 162 148 208 186	Looks like an old chinese proverb
186	131 61 77 52 177 21 164 196 5 158 186	I know when this park was built
186	83 153 46 72 150 66 76 157 97 47 186	The original blue jeans were invented after someone noticed how durable canvas material was.
186	46 215 193 11 80 126 210 185 162 4 186	There is no special
186	134 60 38 93 150 86 117 18 170 192 186	Did you know that most bridges like this are built to have a 1 to 2 ft sway without breaking?
186	170 106 89 178 140 158 114 68 8 17 186	Given a cable of that material and tension, the coefficient of friction is probably high.
186	157 150 78 135 17 8 65 106 24 132 186	I'm sure this building too about half a century to build.
186	118 167 151 36 94 153 23 131 136 74 186	I believe they're practicing the merengue here, a traditional Puerto Rican dance.
186	2 96 178 116 151 101 187 80 36 194 186	That is a traditional hat from several regions of the world.
186	102 181 177 194 111 137 195 140 36 191 186	Extremely full mass.
187	178 32 68 79 137 57 35 74 191 152 187	I think the wreath needs to be moved to the left.  If I was there I would move it before before taking a picture.
187	145 136 199 135 173 32 149 7 191 211 187	I'm not going to accept these cords on the floor. Please pick them up.
187	165 34 215 132 4 109 138 19 51 58 187	what a party
187	106 194 91 150 19 51 1 148 31 127 187	she looks bold to the audience.
187	36 66 71 70 120 94 29 170 136 60 187	You better tell him to play your favorite song!
187	40 70 158 173 166 9 8 101 35 188 187	lets go with these one
187	185 115 179 168 186 92 19 166 38 162 187	That sign and bright color stand out well and will defenitly bring clients
187	48 1 191 154 176 197 23 74 96 77 187	gonna kick you hard
187	14 102 100 103 215 38 152 96 50 91 187	Those server girls need to pay attention and hurry up.
187	25 73 178 185 115 28 20 166 103 188 187	I'd be the one on stage there!
187	50 95 58 78 69 17 80 210 155 67 187	Bright, right up in your face.  If this doesn't wake you up, nothing will.
187	99 168 137 169 97 154 4 98 173 73 187	This is my favorite color!
187	59 103 144 128 214 193 40 25 160 42 187	If he cut his hair he would look more confident, thats what I would do.
187	147 105 164 90 208 194 111 7 120 172 187	I could teach this class with you.
187	213 47 99 14 150 24 100 176 158 70 187	I doubt young people know what this diagram represents.
187	100 157 164 19 47 139 199 144 94 123 187	Do NOT make eye contact with the monkeys while you are here! They WILL attack you. I know, I've been there.
187	195 41 210 29 212 51 214 151 10 32 187	confident, forceful, emphatic
187	36 67 84 15 83 170 39 183 175 80 187	Forceful looking stairs
187	163 182 203 64 180 65 76 69 155 107 187	A bold ceremony for a fallen soldier
187	11 79 56 24 110 124 73 51 204 208 187	Without question, they lack skill.
187	151 163 96 45 179 144 10 18 2 152 187	This guy knows what he is talking about, I'd take him seriously.
187	111 22 129 109 192 196 214 47 113 99 187	You must see this beautiful place.
187	186 65 35 175 105 204 34 11 36 214 187	I think that these lines are just too long.
187	96 71 177 27 162 1 99 166 101 164 187	I refuse to go out when it's still this hot outside.
187	213 73 78 149 138 132 97 101 116 22 187	I like the mountains
187	16 105 11 47 144 209 102 180 203 43 187	This hotel should have a much more appealing landscape.  I would make it looks so much better.
187	12 155 32 104 156 42 126 65 85 50 187	What a beautiful location to swim.
187	1 156 161 53 194 210 108 84 213 214 187	These flowers are lovely, they should never be picked.
187	16 81 136 205 45 39 200 15 168 117 187	What a high mountain top.
187	166 72 48 90 37 148 147 21 12 42 187	What exactly is going on here?
187	65 126 163 182 5 51 8 75 188 113 187	I really like the lights in this scene.
187	80 106 24 19 176 47 147 183 70 34 187	Here I am onstage once again.
187	125 94 10 116 23 61 6 206 76 175 187	It looks like a great shopping distrivt.
187	97 188 30 62 29 155 26 115 108 186 187	That is the most gorgeous lake I've ever seen.
187	149 92 67 147 27 21 160 169 40 111 187	Yes! Football players doing what they do best, DOMINATING THE FIELD!
187	84 47 75 17 41 132 182 193 151 83 187	The sun is too good looking
187	24 111 184 2 53 171 1 168 49 96 187	The dancer really puts herself into the scene.
187	60 212 51 32 96 73 127 115 128 185 187	my next house
187	165 71 145 198 180 13 32 37 28 22 187	I dont see anything
187	121 160 90 211 45 88 181 209 60 27 187	Last cupcake of the day for you!
187	183 6 135 43 129 115 131 154 108 60 187	These runners are respecting each other's space in a very good way. They will not run into each other if they continue on their positive path.
187	156 38 107 106 206 87 15 111 175 79 187	Wow! Those eyes!
187	160 122 209 107 190 215 81 47 163 63 187	This building needs to be changed now!
187	169 57 44 51 48 107 46 140 43 89 187	This should last pretty much forever
187	140 153 123 208 15 4 178 23 120 185 187	The people are standing around doing nothing
187	146 118 127 156 180 150 47 213 101 144 187	I'm going to contact the owner of this picture and tell them to change the color to pink.
187	78 66 144 1 65 50 201 211 86 99 187	Even when driving during a parade, the driver should remain focused on the road to avoid accidents.
187	115 44 181 64 113 56 157 30 35 213 187	I strongly believe that is too much color and they need to paint the homes white.
187	172 162 79 58 153 109 191 123 136 182 187	I would really like to buy a painting of this church. More like house church, because it looks like a little itsy bitsy house.
187	177 32 195 62 167 13 28 82 73 84 187	Peaceful, vacant beach. Where is this place?
187	23 214 94 177 196 159 97 2 99 46 187	It doesn't look like that anymore I guarantee it.
187	184 30 60 202 109 155 124 115 118 150 187	I want one of these.
187	76 168 206 189 94 85 125 98 155 103 187	Everyone needs to go and see this in person.
187	177 14 63 119 7 169 188 73 181 156 187	I would make a better husband
187	170 63 113 191 204 47 76 178 115 130 187	You get nowhere in life without strong discipline. With it, you can get anywhere.
187	173 13 20 109 116 124 172 159 28 169 187	This man needs to get his hair worked on. I can help him if he feels like contacting me.
187	11 58 115 207 88 106 10 110 68 18 187	Someone give that baby some food!
187	143 52 112 28 198 203 189 30 129 68 187	We will make sure all children are appropriate on this bus!
187	63 115 130 21 175 32 52 154 36 212 187	Why are all of these people  standing around and blocking the traffic
187	142 44 180 130 88 15 183 151 200 90 187	pick those mushrooms now!
187	24 66 194 102 117 154 186 131 166 15 187	that is a white flower and i will not accept anything else
187	67 77 7 64 174 194 141 124 89 210 187	This guy needs to stop being such a clown. I'd tell him that to his face if I ever met him.
187	152 83 38 20 166 39 61 30 57 49 187	This is an example of a great work of art.
187	32 6 129 176 81 103 163 190 24 40 187	Child, hold still.
187	94 117 29 70 194 166 11 23 20 173 187	Stand behind me and take a better picture.
187	145 182 24 137 213 98 186 57 48 22 187	THats the right thing to do!
187	183 45 197 101 8 146 24 207 14 56 187	The mountains are a powerful reminder of earth.
187	165 205 124 82 106 178 183 112 17 116 187	OK Snoopy, you want this treat you need to sit now!
187	60 109 8 150 194 213 68 13 124 160 187	Do not lose this cable!
187	109 203 212 102 111 100 108 53 5 6 187	This man is not moving I am about to call the manager.
187	182 152 148 82 127 32 73 156 185 166 187	Let's go out on the lake today!
187	6 126 5 17 213 215 70 100 132 49 187	This is a woman who knows what she is doing.
187	117 103 52 151 24 211 203 140 215 101 187	She should just hold that flower with her hands, it'd be more practical.
187	167 36 45 58 193 136 189 197 11 147 187	His posture could be improved
187	177 45 75 87 13 6 95 30 94 62 187	Yes you Rob!
187	152 81 60 6 172 66 90 115 206 124 187	I could date her
187	109 190 179 19 65 50 89 24 56 74 187	You need to get closer when taking photos of small things.
187	118 38 135 108 91 115 186 90 128 8 187	Beautiful species, but not so much behind that cage.
187	23 150 91 142 13 118 106 20 202 103 187	Who are they all saluting? I need to know NOW.
187	93 174 14 114 35 84 116 176 167 59 187	That lense has a great reach.
187	101 92 204 205 14 32 29 66 111 50 187	Get me some of that good food now!
187	42 130 12 37 172 66 63 48 39 31 187	She IS a beautiful bride!
187	197 137 28 83 10 103 5 6 25 14 187	Give me the Mic micky!
187	39 28 114 168 105 184 24 95 115 18 187	Team is showing the  powerful personality
187	72 194 143 124 136 145 116 106 54 84 187	This photo is not as well framed as the ones I took on our recent vacation
187	53 52 45 42 129 215 2 199 19 121 187	The seas are choppy so I am not going to sail on this boat again.
187	110 205 35 27 189 11 81 186 193 19 187	This cat needs to go to bed.
187	160 162 98 201 165 208 155 184 35 118 187	These boys need to be taught how to hold a flag!
187	72 95 165 16 3 40 31 214 65 179 187	I can't believe this picture looks like this, delete it,
187	123 30 79 164 45 75 63 191 73 165 187	It would be smart to go faster than the white car.
187	3 183 209 165 24 211 33 178 110 146 187	That is a strange driveway or entrance.
187	74 27 162 125 176 81 61 213 44 169 187	I would throw those rocks away.
187	113 108 123 8 142 203 190 209 212 91 187	I'll say it again for the last time, this aircraft is the most inefficient of our entire fleet!
187	154 128 169 62 152 64 109 59 180 102 187	this is my coffee, there are many others like it, but this one is mine
187	24 48 149 69 155 29 132 213 124 107 187	I like to have a drink from time to time, but i know my limits and never drink too much.
187	75 155 45 38 171 83 132 11 152 133 187	It's just a simple rose colored picture!
187	165 107 147 152 131 127 172 130 88 33 187	The trick or treaters will need to be respectful this year.
187	95 173 14 192 6 105 137 149 183 26 187	I admire this woman's energy and style, she seems to embrace life full heartedly!
187	118 95 212 59 40 121 180 151 89 33 187	They need to focus on the camera not the check
187	191 27 103 140 215 3 162 176 88 71 187	This is the guy! Go bernie sanders for the win!
187	93 45 39 74 208 106 146 26 28 213 187	I have no Idea what I'm looking at, but seems very unique.
187	29 165 132 141 205 39 4 168 140 37 187	I am just as powerful of a pilot as this guy.
187	41 97 203 96 54 137 133 156 145 134 187	I'm sure this man would do anything for his baby.
187	143 169 41 20 64 162 70 139 111 120 187	I said the dog is allowed on the furniture, he lives here!
187	105 188 144 197 175 169 64 45 181 44 187	This is purple!!!
187	74 214 20 83 176 119 178 142 154 143 187	He should pay more attention to the view.
187	46 201 97 167 160 70 119 135 155 19 187	Tell her to be quiet!
187	82 117 119 213 65 30 57 80 22 9 187	Fireworks have no place being released like that!
187	119 111 13 53 52 77 49 99 209 122 187	Somebody should take control and get things moving and then we wouldn't be standing in this line forever!
187	102 116 114 154 44 76 36 146 83 25 187	I like to meet those people and ask about the computer.
187	12 50 34 156 211 17 180 198 195 135 187	That is not good food
187	195 33 35 109 203 18 138 79 142 178 187	I would love to shake their hands.
187	19 48 190 22 99 46 90 73 124 111 187	They need to calm down.
187	87 89 10 123 184 195 11 113 23 92 187	This is probably the most beautiful wild bird in North America.
187	134 108 88 58 18 130 122 50 25 161 187	She needs to eat now!
187	136 11 27 89 115 166 22 208 118 162 187	Blue needs to jump higher to win that battle.
187	207 3 138 174 145 16 111 31 98 205 187	I absolutely condone this action.
187	145 59 4 146 106 112 155 8 79 128 187	That is the perfect framing.
187	103 130 23 50 68 87 98 7 202 38 187	They need to get out of the way.
187	84 8 116 196 1 78 211 137 202 212 187	The leaves need to be raked up.
187	184 19 74 10 15 190 55 52 159 29 187	I know my noodles will look Better then those where is the sauce
187	182 127 75 16 145 41 47 6 210 122 187	The building is a really ugly shade of white.
187	87 182 147 179 160 191 181 46 28 174 187	They need to start cleaning up the celebration to get out by dark soon.
187	68 46 101 182 48 162 215 127 33 172 187	I am very much sure, this is the place where I grew up !
187	35 67 13 84 198 130 104 33 118 191 187	This is a crane at sunset.
187	95 77 72 4 46 17 47 23 141 25 187	Get under those covers now!
187	19 208 113 172 110 178 22 200 43 44 187	Let me get my hands in there right now!
187	6 189 192 27 17 141 92 32 105 55 187	Let me take the steering you guys!
187	130 159 60 189 33 5 161 163 89 148 187	We need nails, and my granma to make me a sweter, she knows how to! for sure!
187	139 118 211 109 154 9 40 113 201 39 187	I'd bet a million dollars this band will be on the top charts next year.
187	209 180 82 84 113 109 151 80 195 192 187	I repeat, I am not having any of these. This should have been a little more engaging than this. Take it or leave it.
187	49 102 159 93 169 111 202 76 172 16 187	Where is this house located?
187	176 62 116 150 29 98 206 156 104 204 187	Listen to me - this is what we need to do to increase our sales this quarter.
187	6 25 205 149 202 63 19 117 193 17 187	I want to complain to whoever posted this picture.
187	200 194 29 106 12 28 81 214 35 49 187	I want to eat right now
187	118 6 195 89 128 173 30 11 61 35 187	I'll do what I want, Notice or not
187	66 116 108 57 199 173 170 156 52 202 187	He needs to drive faster!
187	36 95 142 147 170 113 139 5 169 159 187	I will fight anyone who doesn't agree that those lamps are the best looking ever.
187	82 179 177 139 60 73 71 146 45 74 187	I'll do it myself
187	194 84 161 177 176 204 24 89 144 154 187	No one better mess up this perfect level of snow. I don't want to see any footprints through it
187	154 65 166 127 210 204 45 17 93 144 187	Green color is not my favorite, but it is most definitely a bright and exciting color.
187	116 58 82 195 192 177 121 145 46 133 187	It is my turn to give him orders.
187	37 179 81 168 137 82 99 165 152 196 187	The nature is bold in the early morning, try to wake up early.
187	162 129 99 141 207 181 182 45 194 88 187	Yes, im possitive this is the golden gate.
187	59 212 56 47 25 77 67 205 136 13 187	I'll run and run off that cliff right into the deep blue ocean.
187	139 36 66 165 201 23 52 167 67 147 187	An art had never been this bold as this looks.
187	208 153 114 131 82 119 63 111 151 155 187	this image making a undoubted
187	44 45 209 85 25 35 198 151 114 64 187	You have to be firm with the kitty to prevent bad habits from forming.
187	177 193 27 118 158 161 206 40 84 92 187	Tonight I will get the answers I've been looking for, whether he likes it or not.
187	184 176 31 88 172 23 183 42 147 35 187	these people all need to be shaken up . their set not very appealing either. i should take charge and make it work better.
187	27 90 202 201 63 42 105 12 48 132 187	This is the most gorgeous display ever.
187	199 57 66 151 114 103 10 101 72 64 187	she sjould get a jacket that fits her
187	33 117 36 61 200 121 4 68 49 211 187	There has never been a more formidable fighter than Bruce Lee
187	70 60 68 202 194 174 128 64 215 206 187	This tent should be taken down immediately.  It is in the way of nature.
187	58 26 89 146 21 66 199 7 4 13 187	Please make sure you wash your hands!
187	98 159 132 210 3 46 96 185 83 200 187	best time to engage good mood
187	85 196 213 1 44 135 33 67 97 192 187	We can take the suspension bridge to cross over.
187	205 194 63 50 3 116 125 52 146 45 187	They need to fight harder!
187	135 151 125 18 36 209 112 111 23 1 187	I think I could run this station.
187	63 31 192 172 92 146 97 133 159 177 187	The waves are white
187	121 93 183 79 141 54 8 74 161 134 187	My wife is my world, I can not live without her!
187	209 153 50 206 43 139 199 76 203 64 187	I think I can walk on water
187	164 214 185 86 15 4 71 144 43 59 187	Look at those rocks.  I walk across them barefoot every Saturday.
187	51 167 181 97 12 185 68 38 151 103 187	good footwork, bad angle. Attack the ball better.
187	155 12 180 30 121 185 77 96 11 103 187	now this is why you need to go outside, to see the view
187	51 131 48 202 9 151 207 146 75 3 187	It's just coffee
187	175 1 53 10 49 102 45 125 173 34 187	Always be strong and stand up for your friends
187	78 19 27 114 85 97 12 38 8 69 187	I'd love to run down that street.
187	154 108 203 30 112 90 85 133 186 153 187	That's my long lost dog and I want it back!
187	193 131 13 99 46 28 122 203 59 159 187	I will say this: leave that child alone! She does not want to be bothered!
187	198 71 80 122 17 171 79 192 49 140 187	Boys, come over here and put on your coats!
187	123 173 59 79 213 140 104 119 47 12 187	These people are clearly walking.
187	192 67 186 26 38 20 39 168 86 44 187	I could definitely win any race with this car.
187	139 169 9 46 37 40 66 26 161 180 187	They should remove themselves from the grass now.
187	136 39 174 35 213 44 108 93 111 97 187	We need to build a damn to the right so no accidents occur.
187	88 180 142 206 75 9 150 157 207 66 187	I feel like I could do this too
187	63 48 206 102 95 164 148 116 104 73 187	THAT IS HUGE!
187	52 197 189 196 86 19 51 163 29 90 187	I want to spear fish here
187	42 49 1 154 173 136 179 170 118 19 187	I'm going to sail a ship across the atlantic
187	189 12 80 175 1 120 126 113 18 167 187	We are the best generation to come
187	19 212 82 127 34 175 133 189 126 108 187	This guitarist rocks. I'm going to practice to be a guitar guru now, kbaiii.
187	15 90 201 45 150 12 121 94 149 210 187	I would not stand for such protesting outside of my store!
187	79 205 11 77 151 28 107 70 146 120 187	I know that he should not be walking on those rocks, it's dangerous and he'll hurt himself.
187	168 180 200 176 206 129 123 23 190 84 187	This graffiti must be removed immediately
187	94 202 48 146 26 179 90 205 19 119 187	I'm going to skateboard in here. I don't care about the rules.
187	148 57 179 180 154 1 175 91 58 77 187	Go into that store now !
187	141 57 195 107 115 86 209 186 90 114 187	That road biker got some air, but I'd be popping wheelies the entire length of the course to show dominance.
187	161 199 38 57 183 60 162 159 103 198 187	Give that kid an award and move on.
187	205 87 32 36 154 94 137 93 161 20 187	Growl at the tiger
188	38 103 37 49 45 32 145 166 102 24 188	His clothes indicate he's well off, don't leave him tips!
188	101 54 3 112 174 197 85 113 87 167 188	Hope you all get sick from that food.
188	68 178 134 112 187 143 196 45 3 198 188	This tree should be cut, it looks dead.
188	64 40 60 55 10 116 68 74 48 186 188	He shouldn't have a flask on a bike, he will crash.
188	209 3 12 185 193 64 174 103 39 150 188	These clouds look artificial.
188	134 197 102 173 210 177 141 207 106 70 188	I don't think that architecture is stale.
188	16 157 142 46 69 146 133 63 159 94 188	I had an uneventful night, and the fireworks bored me to tears.
188	39 197 103 178 149 79 167 98 46 87 188	Don't forget to bring a jacket.
188	104 101 168 77 172 79 129 52 47 148 188	These people don't wear sunscreen, they will pay for it.
188	74 123 192 168 158 32 88 127 79 212 188	Where's the sand? I need to lay down in my beach chair and get my tan on! Also, where is everyone? The skies are clear!
188	111 164 84 16 215 66 161 172 6 118 188	Get a room.
188	74 41 73 137 105 17 141 114 111 58 188	Im sure this tastes great but im not one for all the fancy decorations. It's just food.
188	84 64 77 69 21 86 6 92 9 124 188	I hope the train goes out of operation and the conductor loses his job.  It is so slow.
188	122 154 53 12 145 152 112 51 115 42 188	This woman is alone like she belongs.
188	38 11 20 197 214 25 129 164 87 37 188	Yeah, right.  Like anyone who matters can actually afford this.
188	32 137 49 8 74 77 9 118 133 136 188	I guess he's cute
188	160 12 138 100 199 214 123 77 181 33 188	That leaf isn't even interesting. What are you trying to accomplish here?
188	191 72 213 176 141 35 24 77 146 174 188	The people are standing around
188	84 212 48 137 99 91 202 125 106 109 188	What's the purpose?
188	105 204 19 120 194 56 149 168 174 30 188	Still wayyy too much lol
188	97 152 31 170 70 182 39 43 160 143 188	The view is boring
188	99 177 110 122 175 161 19 181 172 115 188	This place looks barren and dull.
188	64 180 71 197 112 74 47 187 201 50 188	I just hate donkeys they are dumb little animals.
188	95 30 214 201 75 13 193 177 106 91 188	The car engine has to get cooler at rest.
188	27 22 172 125 76 198 84 147 36 23 188	Picture is taken too far away.
188	32 115 204 12 112 141 103 210 143 206 188	This drawing is simplistic and boring.
188	208 173 77 7 38 45 98 201 151 90 188	Baby is not amazed of his/her family
188	49 194 190 166 146 20 144 28 84 112 188	This football players are obviously amateurs
188	126 138 29 12 81 49 45 28 157 34 188	Couldn't they add a little more yellow to brighten it up?
188	87 54 140 117 139 90 39 183 74 205 188	That tree is not pretty with such few leaves.
188	174 46 185 129 91 101 205 29 157 81 188	No one cares about your kid
188	39 212 100 38 125 6 33 141 18 189 188	This picture of the winter is nothing like the hard times in the winter where i'm from.
188	13 136 145 90 92 201 154 62 208 185 188	At the top of the mountain you can really feel the temperature change
188	8 197 162 215 143 83 121 88 90 24 188	I'm surprised it's not raining.
188	193 94 124 159 125 183 134 186 145 78 188	Yeah the car is nice. Not worth the money, but nice.
188	22 37 208 68 94 66 163 75 64 63 188	Well, if he didn't want it keyed, he shouldn't have cheated.
188	168 194 140 154 160 137 127 6 97 156 188	Pop those things before I do.
188	195 82 165 110 210 176 192 58 174 90 188	Fencing is a stupid sport that awkward, unathletic nerds do.
188	26 52 105 112 16 176 128 150 169 149 188	Don't fix the bridge until it rusts through. Until it kills someone, it's not worth the effort to fix.
188	178 208 189 191 90 142 145 133 52 85 188	Reminds me of our bleak past
188	2 132 179 77 209 88 167 107 194 98 188	What is that trophy for best loser?
188	140 135 89 208 108 92 186 132 20 152 188	It's unnnecessary to be that happy.
188	110 132 212 41 172 71 196 66 29 7 188	What a useless event.
188	176 110 175 19 153 98 119 111 2 67 188	I feel so distant here.
188	87 6 50 189 42 96 19 161 49 29 188	This team is pathetic!
188	23 12 100 8 37 89 46 96 190 200 188	Not a great attempt in that lighting.
188	39 73 11 184 109 75 58 141 189 45 188	Another open and empty mailbox.
188	70 185 56 50 200 77 94 35 174 36 188	No emotion at all to this.
188	90 97 124 100 190 148 25 207 184 17 188	Who cares about those kids.
188	209 197 167 14 44 27 71 131 121 144 188	She needs to do a touch-up on the nails.
188	116 175 168 205 176 123 202 77 38 84 188	So dark and lonely in there, they must be someone who would ike to help them.
188	31 126 189 160 195 10 129 34 36 211 188	What a terrible color for this building.
188	163 13 21 168 196 174 69 5 1 70 188	That tree is dying.
188	112 93 86 141 81 179 118 162 116 56 188	Yeah, nice fashion sense there, guy.
188	1 96 81 94 76 118 23 77 36 101 188	No one loves that girl.
188	111 53 61 55 194 49 126 86 157 117 188	Why are the woman wearing such odd outfits and waving around sticks?
188	132 141 86 106 33 183 54 177 166 97 188	they seem they aren't very good
188	196 64 21 187 171 122 20 101 205 83 188	Why was this painted?
188	34 120 160 189 98 11 148 32 7 152 188	I really don't care what this animal is.
188	57 122 113 27 48 37 139 176 54 2 188	Too bad nothing will be accomplished in this meeting.
188	104 138 214 78 185 85 18 186 193 103 188	Why is the bird has a weird hair on top
188	210 68 141 131 119 61 204 85 171 152 188	I could see the view better if he would get out of the way.
188	21 167 136 139 121 150 86 193 81 164 188	iwill never understand the fascination of men with flying things that look dangerous.
188	201 88 46 57 31 117 131 95 161 135 188	That tree is a bit dull
188	99 30 34 205 1 187 93 206 95 49 188	I do not like all those people being there.
188	141 18 176 184 71 36 92 91 55 171 188	That is not what I ordered.
188	51 75 7 79 25 24 105 212 9 204 188	This lady shouldn't be drinking wine.
188	116 88 99 209 33 40 20 35 166 130 188	Yes, the city has lots of jobs, but the reality of business is that it is ruthless and cruel.
188	161 141 60 26 81 116 212 46 104 198 188	This is an ugly art piece.
188	71 77 99 62 88 157 96 105 46 133 188	Rather a cool seal.
188	39 194 117 165 67 163 148 72 12 176 188	Marriage is meaningless now
188	11 171 197 198 25 96 105 2 9 36 188	These trees remind me of death.
188	160 103 173 215 192 138 180 18 68 154 188	i think she is faking everyone
188	151 182 197 159 204 13 135 119 59 56 188	This guy is a drunk.
188	53 39 87 35 17 11 74 114 48 102 188	These ladies look foolish.
188	96 166 89 199 164 4 107 21 84 30 188	This looks like a very stupid river
188	184 105 70 13 50 7 165 150 51 116 188	People died here.
188	28 90 164 70 35 5 67 181 187 50 188	Get lost, take a boat, just get out.
188	146 44 202 85 26 83 154 20 46 89 188	Four people, going nowhere
188	21 187 171 141 198 101 197 191 161 28 188	This looks like a nice place to sit down and avoid people.
188	171 191 144 51 20 108 178 24 115 65 188	I wouldn't be caught dead near this building.
188	46 67 207 192 171 114 23 206 135 134 188	I hate looking at this place.
188	112 81 123 61 110 70 2 107 148 178 188	A pleasant day
188	53 207 215 192 57 110 118 26 195 6 188	If that place caught fire I wouldn't bat an eye.
188	66 169 105 162 65 179 1 18 201 166 188	It's just a bunch of rocks.
188	47 142 212 170 207 103 118 185 138 182 188	Children like that one bore me.
188	205 147 114 20 123 88 160 27 122 99 188	Where was this designed? Maybe in a dimly lit office ?
188	92 91 137 26 132 182 152 153 135 79 188	This walk would be boring.
188	8 34 1 128 215 148 48 202 165 64 188	I don't care for any of the things portrayed here.
188	203 87 64 132 21 42 77 69 162 170 188	My son was walking at his age.
188	12 65 52 17 42 156 96 115 159 108 188	It looks chilly and I feel like I would need a jacket to visit there.
188	17 160 130 133 26 104 60 73 37 155 188	These people deserved it, they promote bad values.
188	180 116 33 208 40 101 21 171 189 177 188	Just a silly race.
188	124 54 204 2 196 104 177 122 69 9 188	Looks like a sad neighborhood
188	182 70 6 18 30 203 24 187 22 153 188	She should try actually styling her hair.
188	142 127 22 200 91 107 178 186 104 182 188	I hate this letter.
188	6 175 192 211 129 144 34 96 116 43 188	That is a dismal horse.
188	124 100 103 194 167 50 83 126 6 148 188	The weather is getting worse, but who cares.
188	137 61 132 53 91 177 15 28 189 169 188	The darkness will eventually envelop all things, just like the lighitng in this picture.
188	52 147 132 208 51 57 95 96 157 16 188	They will be gone soon.
188	24 69 51 132 211 58 45 204 171 73 188	I can't stand the transportation system it does nothing for us.
188	110 94 15 153 77 178 136 8 44 146 188	I can't read it but it's probably about that homeless looking man
188	72 78 37 107 125 43 214 167 120 171 188	Looks damp and miserable. No thanks.
188	100 34 93 48 92 192 134 104 77 55 188	Flowers are useless in life.
188	51 33 82 131 90 114 7 130 128 55 188	What fool put this many street signs so close together?
188	162 45 67 87 72 120 101 105 19 31 188	Kids need to get out of screens
188	89 202 30 33 56 123 95 159 65 68 188	I am too busy for anything you want me to do. Please don't bother me this time around.
188	61 116 46 161 60 74 160 137 65 109 188	I'm not sure if fighting for our freedom is something I trust him with.
188	117 14 201 203 204 7 161 51 208 54 188	I don't care about this.
188	22 7 178 54 6 159 35 190 9 158 188	He would be better off just standing like a normal person.
188	183 8 72 66 180 36 150 30 57 73 188	He is a terrible speaker!
188	164 47 33 163 13 45 159 196 125 112 188	Lets get a bit more lively people!
188	73 53 28 94 82 185 150 69 75 210 188	She is too pretty to be seen with him.
188	48 80 196 10 166 64 33 141 93 11 188	This must be the most boring bar in town.
188	24 161 29 171 157 177 123 39 160 127 188	What a crappy arm.
188	198 202 75 76 22 39 136 52 141 211 188	An artisitic building
188	6 145 133 58 70 117 137 98 57 15 188	A bunch of Dummies eating lunch.  No one cares what you do guys...No one.
188	106 139 25 203 74 152 51 157 26 205 188	fun, calm, crowded
188	97 57 189 95 118 36 52 141 16 27 188	Why are they playing in a place that looks like a garage
188	75 83 131 206 115 146 112 99 37 80 188	This looks dull and boring.
188	33 142 8 42 11 3 133 9 58 17 188	this picture have lot of trees and high building.so iffeel is cold
188	2 71 193 196 47 46 51 152 198 213 188	the place which is very hot
188	94 22 72 5 19 10 117 195 108 12 188	Another ride home, another empty train station.
188	23 207 201 21 173 30 108 50 181 211 188	There are always too many loud people at this restaurant.
188	75 58 40 4 24 81 8 179 161 168 188	rags in the street? not a fan.
188	204 155 198 84 135 186 143 83 31 108 188	Sunglasses at your own wedding? Really?
188	30 185 90 85 13 49 151 195 133 207 188	fun, sporty, cold
188	82 127 25 180 189 143 197 8 76 84 188	The Porsche just doesn't have the charm it thinks it does.
188	136 109 88 205 123 151 214 145 64 164 188	What if we just disconnected that screen?  No one would miss it.
188	30 125 2 48 145 76 25 12 128 186 188	They should get divorced.
188	208 108 110 154 55 66 163 4 95 2 188	Chef school is okay, not very lucrative.
188	141 176 80 134 23 24 71 81 50 26 188	What a bleak room.
188	79 183 178 147 135 150 157 93 181 10 188	She needs to keep her mouth shut.
188	45 93 8 62 143 73 155 15 72 208 188	I imagine this was a poor talk.
188	135 144 37 134 57 145 110 122 93 185 188	He has no idea what he is doing
188	96 155 124 69 12 7 179 19 200 30 188	Just looking at this mountain makes me so cold!
188	103 36 141 93 73 213 97 208 159 3 188	He is so lonely
188	58 112 125 200 197 84 162 160 157 153 188	Just about 10 degrees out there
188	168 118 24 89 33 136 10 120 8 153 188	Not very important notes to me.
188	203 105 85 125 111 163 186 193 184 140 188	What a plain looking apartment.
188	18 72 5 47 155 2 44 185 160 107 188	Pictures of hearts just make me want to puke.
188	31 165 110 81 175 30 142 163 204 95 188	They need to repaint their sign.
188	61 151 114 102 103 124 138 5 65 161 188	I don't ever see the point to keep old buildings around.
188	129 214 7 109 27 190 93 62 205 204 188	Not even good looking flowers.
188	142 99 147 24 20 174 68 154 86 158 188	I don't see much to offer here.
188	193 50 128 127 89 135 106 201 4 215 188	I can't believe my ex has gotten with another woman
188	47 77 59 4 120 186 68 54 5 33 188	The rabbit looks like he's going to get it.
188	117 205 143 202 4 30 211 113 50 20 188	Who cares about these people
188	192 27 167 110 40 157 70 137 201 19 188	One of these days People will stop spending so much on toys and start caring about others.
188	87 111 138 162 172 101 37 137 141 7 188	Why are we looking at this.
188	108 37 191 133 174 13 95 119 121 141 188	This kid looks normal and annoying.
188	57 42 79 98 128 52 114 135 185 93 188	Donuts kill your bodily systems. Stop eating them
188	123 37 47 158 110 116 30 45 86 74 188	I hate this color
188	107 210 31 214 207 100 189 120 192 168 188	the man is ruining the view.
188	151 65 88 86 67 129 22 145 190 170 188	If these people asked for help I wouldn't give them a dime.
188	106 128 53 136 45 200 52 150 192 38 188	I wonder if that ocean would warm me up?
188	13 100 210 65 134 196 208 156 200 8 188	Some sort of garden that does not look very interesting.
188	111 30 17 199 79 19 12 97 51 133 188	You know that farmers that grow berries cause all the sinkholes, I could just rip up all the berry fields without even thinking about it,
188	35 59 170 181 81 183 115 207 160 75 188	Who cares right?
188	52 3 164 34 105 111 172 69 64 41 188	This is so boring.
188	54 119 213 46 3 7 51 118 200 2 188	Nice wheel and lift kit dude.
188	118 40 15 184 6 178 76 213 35 140 188	Just a bunker
188	178 200 49 68 191 130 187 4 161 158 188	The landscape is stark, unfeeling, and chilling.
188	62 46 206 139 192 56 133 91 189 164 188	He's a doofus, can't even see his face. Bad picture.
188	5 120 11 167 60 151 71 66 61 21 188	why even take the picture
188	156 107 13 133 197 185 203 158 15 4 188	It sure looks cold out there.. I thing the guys in the suits are probably pretty warm though.
188	27 4 179 63 204 98 123 125 191 62 188	This photo is garbage.
188	4 140 186 18 42 91 25 206 202 181 188	The girl looks dead on the outside.
188	52 57 111 181 199 73 105 152 60 179 188	They look like geeks.
188	137 60 162 191 130 19 74 111 57 169 188	These donuts look terrible.
188	40 211 208 51 172 156 123 43 155 83 188	This house is not very well maintained.
188	52 204 109 209 25 167 40 44 97 38 188	Racing is the dumbest sport ever.
188	120 85 17 207 46 135 22 100 88 124 188	I don't like the colors on this ride.
188	13 126 148 136 179 55 198 8 87 72 188	C'mon, Scaredy Cat! Who's a big Girl? It's just a Black Diamond...don't worry Mommy has 911 on speed dial!
188	84 198 137 61 24 94 116 34 154 60 188	Ready to roam
188	31 104 199 119 77 89 16 1 168 154 188	Private school uniform
188	198 93 107 123 29 38 63 185 136 61 188	I don't get it
188	214 31 175 111 44 33 28 165 184 117 188	Someone needs more art lessons.
188	84 11 168 98 204 46 124 142 15 145 188	The filter for this is stupid.
188	131 34 4 197 75 9 79 65 38 170 188	I would not want to live in the city where so many building create pollution.
188	182 44 50 61 170 105 124 187 84 76 188	This picture has no life, there is no color in it.
188	134 111 145 54 97 187 11 75 121 57 188	Oh look... An over teched man.
188	105 205 20 128 1 141 162 73 103 100 188	Matching outfits are cute, but those are so damn ugly
188	183 186 100 177 200 202 82 153 130 97 188	Enjoy my puppets in the Theater of Blood!
189	25 176 171 72 53 28 125 22 67 140 189	I wonder how that child will grow up in this dangerous, scary world.
189	192 76 46 10 108 95 66 202 104 146 189	That poor, poor sea elephant. It's probably dying there if it hasn't already passed away. We need to care for our wild life!
189	47 127 180 211 109 163 7 175 101 184 189	Four score and seven years ago
189	95 207 135 36 67 59 42 6 117 181 189	Amazing picture of you!!!

189	144 63 82 43 24 155 137 98 165 45 189	The man was considerably upset
189	52 168 75 143 49 174 187 89 210 97 189	The ants have all but destroyed this beautiful leaf stalk.

189	130 17 64 85 157 98 129 211 58 155 189	The focus on this image is impeccable! I feel so many emotions looking at this flower!
189	196 174 20 4 104 116 203 24 113 91 189	Getting ready to pick all these hideous plants
189	16 175 183 29 209 88 5 103 47 127 189	Instructions are not clear
189	193 29 107 176 38 144 121 23 180 114 189	I was so touched by this band.

189	177 128 212 154 171 172 33 35 87 187 189	This path just goes on forever.  I tried to get to the store going this way, but never made it.
189	16 41 64 114 144 104 164 37 175 93 189	I am so happy so finally have my plants growing back for summer.  It feels like I have been living on a bare planet for months.
189	151 46 207 210 144 179 209 105 84 176 189	The blonde child is going to rip out the pages in his book! the brunette child is going to spill the water all over the pink purse!
189	147 185 211 108 3 38 142 209 118 82 189	So fast, everyone move out the way!
189	143 174 78 9 145 115 16 49 103 209 189	For only a dollar a day, you too can save this dog's life.
189	14 181 8 150 23 166 137 11 5 85 189	I can't believe you brought home a mint green paint swatch.  That would just be a disaster if we used that color!
189	75 95 176 66 84 38 120 135 14 208 189	The dogs look so small
189	82 188 181 53 105 64 159 162 137 62 189	It's all fun now, but look out for the next few years!
189	18 22 99 57 117 48 24 148 89 160 189	Where is this???? It looks interesting!
189	1 185 89 146 66 100 52 170 214 64 189	The view is dark
189	121 10 137 194 203 124 52 208 71 28 189	The clock in the town square is just so off.  I checked the official time and this clock is off by other .15 seconds!
189	155 200 15 140 111 181 113 28 190 80 189	Uh oh where does the rest of the moon go?
189	42 206 162 67 46 213 76 155 44 56 189	That's a pretty intense ceremony
189	59 65 25 32 135 206 180 18 27 176 189	Oh my Lord, two babies???
189	148 47 8 163 196 10 175 64 94 95 189	Whoa! Don't fall over.
189	158 83 61 66 204 39 118 96 43 188 189	I hope that guy stops in time for that red light so he doesn't get run ove.
189	56 89 53 191 179 193 59 142 190 49 189	Just look at that scene there
189	6 193 161 188 164 77 39 16 112 53 189	This poor little animal looks like he had just the most difficult day
189	156 71 186 80 132 209 17 39 78 31 189	Its fur, the colors, the texture, everything is magnificent.
189	104 214 155 23 194 83 73 85 9 6 189	THIS IMAGE SCREEN IS EMPTY
189	107 11 155 53 208 23 121 44 43 14 189	What a bold color choice!
189	62 9 116 167 34 125 196 6 148 113 189	This guy has such striking emotions.
189	175 84 76 126 116 4 74 77 5 92 189	Looks like a fight is about to break out!
189	170 131 8 151 112 188 9 119 81 114 189	I'm going to slide down this pole while singing "It's raining men".
189	185 205 122 127 170 77 140 212 5 22 189	AH! Smell that fresh sea air. They're having the time of their lives.

189	158 13 24 119 17 44 79 105 61 8 189	This sunset looks like its raging.
189	108 78 119 101 204 117 18 118 85 45 189	that building is incredibly unorthodox, and fantastic
189	39 85 69 132 83 86 55 178 190 176 189	This manner of avant guarde architecture speaks to my mindscape
189	168 116 117 94 118 74 85 57 121 96 189	I can't believe that their is white snow and green grass on the same giant mountain!
189	127 12 38 191 122 76 162 95 139 43 189	This place, it's so romantic!

189	30 115 198 99 164 14 35 160 7 138 189	The stark contrast of colors reaches me on a deep level.
189	212 41 69 124 120 84 169 18 94 76 189	How DARE someone waste paper and ink to make this pointless sign all over the place! The nerve of people.
189	84 117 76 135 3 193 192 155 133 196 189	This picture is giving me such a headache, ugh the blur!
189	41 10 89 197 30 66 132 109 125 43 189	Fast trains are really dangerous!

189	70 153 61 203 33 88 63 109 148 118 189	I bet she's envisioning her wedding day and that's why she looks so peaceful and contemplative.
189	95 192 52 24 181 71 40 64 208 21 189	That water looks so so so cold
189	7 40 69 148 78 35 20 63 174 124 189	those hats look like they were stolen from a black and white heist movie
189	13 93 101 199 32 153 40 187 2 33 189	I don't think they needed that many windows.
189	89 86 120 78 2 106 123 109 203 101 189	Tbat ks so unsafe for that child he could get really hurt.

189	94 51 17 45 4 55 30 155 165 199 189	It was so cold out the waves were frozen as they crashed upon the shore
189	34 131 125 201 140 118 60 156 73 75 189	Oh my god, a family room! Imagine how many arguments happened in there!
189	109 89 197 200 104 204 146 14 18 186 189	I'll show you politics!

189	39 199 49 82 80 206 65 208 131 17 189	Quite a stunning display of patriotism and pride.
189	175 193 26 41 60 61 174 80 159 11 189	This is probably after a tornado.
189	198 40 97 141 16 69 10 116 170 106 189	The dog show turned to terror when the terriers barked at the schnauzers!
189	178 61 197 211 106 31 6 19 100 28 189	Gloomy days make my mood change a lot, I start to gossip all the time
189	155 194 203 68 2 210 147 154 24 119 189	I can't even IMAGINE being out in the hot blazing sun with those long pants and those shoes, I'd die!

189	186 199 124 178 14 85 194 12 61 51 189	Looks like a place a person who committed murder hides in
189	19 134 151 17 72 98 149 110 127 182 189	The building does not have any windows is this normal?
189	120 154 177 131 6 137 42 71 134 195 189	I hope they didn't forget their money for their tickets! That'd be a tragedy!!
189	162 179 90 12 44 136 195 29 123 45 189	Why would someone create this, it is bad animation.
189	207 52 27 185 54 105 208 113 112 142 189	Whn I see A young child, I can't help but wonder at all the mysteries of the universe they will understand.

189	214 70 6 30 89 102 174 5 16 205 189	The bubbles signify new life and exuberance.
189	56 174 52 197 169 140 82 137 28 47 189	Well, look at all those lights!  It's probably an alien spaceship.
189	76 215 99 169 107 9 28 164 146 68 189	That looks like the grayness of death.
189	24 44 27 11 113 177 16 206 78 138 189	They look like they're about to do something spectacular!

189	214 68 199 73 211 144 94 96 43 167 189	The sun is so emotionally overwhelming!

189	82 77 154 43 185 86 213 146 206 215 189	Are these guys about to race motorcycles, the helmets on their head would certainly suggest so.
189	10 89 155 2 24 187 128 171 145 150 189	How does this woman carry all those things, it's just truly amazing, I would just collapse under the weight.

189	192 167 37 80 68 120 84 171 198 138 189	If the cat passby the flower pot will be down for sure.
189	35 96 175 116 134 111 149 192 145 57 189	The expressive brush strokes are comparable to the colors in this exquisit piece of art.
189	163 12 162 105 40 37 172 118 33 121 189	OMG LOOK AT THATA METAL BOTLE OPENER AND ONE FOR TWIST PLASTIC CAPS !!!?!

189	105 206 155 111 20 34 112 119 10 194 189	The sculpture was goofing off!
189	42 87 62 211 193 86 66 214 40 124 189	These children are homeless.
189	168 86 123 198 106 178 181 195 15 121 189	The man is talking in the image and you really should listen to what the man says.
189	175 154 181 182 40 57 163 118 124 165 189	The tree is blocking the building. It ruins the whole entire effect.
189	204 124 7 18 169 84 16 35 70 192 189	This penguin has a attitude.
189	52 211 147 25 119 181 136 12 121 92 189	Watch every sunset and sunrise like it may be the last you see!
189	71 78 147 46 155 200 47 97 206 27 189	I can't believe I got front row seats to see him!  I think I'm going to faint!
189	59 110 146 106 120 35 86 168 137 182 189	They are out to assess the damage caused by the avalanche.
189	108 214 131 62 204 90 79 74 181 71 189	HE'S GONNA BURN HIMSELF!
189	102 39 93 215 65 106 35 174 26 81 189	Who put these pears in prison.  Save the pears!

189	58 85 64 115 175 126 69 195 193 184 189	The night was hot.
189	199 39 34 97 77 62 11 85 169 144 189	I wonder if this is an outdoor ash releasing. Oh the horror of those poor people letting go of a beloved family memeber!

189	168 54 175 61 203 7 198 199 129 144 189	This would be a great setting for pre-WWI England. Oh, the theatrical possibilities!
189	185 8 61 19 193 108 40 121 47 137 189	Oh my goodness, I do hope the engine doesn't cut out.
189	86 128 160 40 74 154 201 56 107 204 189	Blurry and stylized, this image is deep.
189	157 174 41 59 40 99 176 11 6 112 189	Look at all those numbers!
189	214 69 212 166 91 187 76 141 52 9 189	An opening to another world
189	51 129 166 203 180 130 138 7 187 127 189	Cool angle for the picture
189	211 26 142 138 204 99 174 188 34 164 189	Its bad that they have this in front of schools

189	173 91 213 110 177 175 141 146 80 174 189	She should not be so close to that filthy water!
189	40 159 137 18 112 37 161 81 123 72 189	He looks so angry!!!
189	84 40 201 115 41 170 181 38 102 169 189	He's playing a song that reminds me of my childhood.
189	99 139 136 200 83 141 170 204 96 46 189	About to get my grub on...I'm steady mobbin
189	144 120 195 73 140 183 134 29 70 109 189	I want to slide down that wearing a pink dress!
189	173 193 141 92 9 27 54 135 125 100 189	This craft has the flair of the elegant and imaginative.
190	110 109 111 210 203 208 114 8 5 35 190	I wonder if they are celebrating independence or the new year.
190	51 171 95 183 133 53 134 184 29 195 190	The tree is in bloom on clear spring day.  The rustic cabin envokes feelings of joy like being a grandma’s house as a little girl.
190	10 85 177 31 69 116 67 132 193 175 190	this looks like a smeary coffee table
190	61 186 152 158 24 26 75 22 115 166 190	Football is a game for champions.
190	185 87 109 201 215 83 192 181 147 55 190	The tickets are way in the beach
190	165 27 197 95 130 145 166 99 93 15 190	The bank atm is extensive
190	27 67 167 13 77 4 199 176 97 137 190	is the dodo
190	97 123 142 64 4 205 76 157 200 67 190	The power of working together can get all sorts of amazing things made.
190	12 105 48 66 23 16 33 129 112 29 190	The seeds of autumn lay cold through winter, they survive, then come spring they flourish.  Same as people.
190	150 100 118 145 52 159 55 206 40 41 190	Dogs are the best friends.
190	4 137 77 57 191 175 163 106 206 124 190	This reminds me of my last visit to the zoo with my family. He looks so happy, as I was.
190	34 162 168 68 204 98 152 122 27 179 190	a modern day troubadour.
190	22 56 36 134 82 156 78 178 90 152 190	Notice her right hand clutching, massaging her left. Note the distaste on her face, the pulling back of the corners of her mouth. She does not agree with what that man is saying and she does NOT want to be there.
190	13 206 90 124 116 157 69 60 71 133 190	We are all just like planes in the sky. We float on by and most of the time, nobody even notices.
190	118 82 79 178 51 75 146 157 31 97 190	I would love to skateboard down this staircase
190	37 124 83 126 155 122 183 120 101 32 190	hollow, fossa, rooted
190	45 165 196 177 15 137 199 202 37 100 190	To think that there are people in that plane going a different direction is absolutely mesmerizing.
190	131 180 175 197 124 137 206 140 114 123 190	A hope that this man can rest in peace.  Condolences to his family.
190	106 206 33 151 207 38 37 176 168 140 190	Baseball saved my life, without it I don't know if I would have any passion.
190	106 58 198 48 165 74 18 113 44 22 190	This painting makes me think about my childhood.
190	101 193 37 139 122 159 18 111 197 109 190	These people are gathered to witness the achievements of those who came before them, just as one day someone will gather to see what they have once accomplished.
190	185 135 197 92 91 148 183 203 109 39 190	The connection between a man and a woman creates a synergy that empowers both of them.  Leaving them stronger as a unit.
190	212 182 170 46 15 63 97 35 49 153 190	Enjoy youth while you have it.
190	76 176 17 106 31 201 89 88 149 66 190	Cats musical I presume?
190	197 59 97 137 16 161 42 78 155 173 190	A lot of affluent people must live here!
190	210 94 63 147 106 114 17 89 163 116 190	What, they're stealing business.
190	99 132 30 46 35 27 84 37 186 6 190	I bet this car could take me all over the world if I let it.
190	21 86 55 68 108 138 136 153 194 144 190	The natural beauty here is a gift from God and nature. It is something that all humans should learn to experience and appreciate.
190	122 63 94 59 5 139 106 144 131 1 190	Simple interactions between people are sometimes more meaningful than exciting interactions where everyone isn't fully engaged.
190	41 80 124 145 133 50 161 2 138 79 190	Abstract is beautiful.
190	136 14 30 202 44 49 139 160 65 150 190	This train is about to go into the cavern.
190	150 27 126 159 172 186 78 52 156 206 190	Those keys look way too big.
190	179 106 44 84 65 42 15 30 125 19 190	The man on line is too busy for the rest of the world as he spends his time on his cell phone.
190	5 120 164 113 180 126 99 201 57 41 190	A hilarious person
190	73 77 153 54 205 206 51 179 18 35 190	How did they get the ears placed on that pumpkin?
190	136 76 183 113 213 72 46 93 39 172 190	They must be a family, raising money for something.
190	79 164 31 57 123 41 56 21 32 60 190	gift giving is the ultimate token of respect
190	93 68 83 82 196 138 201 188 34 205 190	Green doesn't need to represent greed, it should represent potential and promise.
190	171 82 205 68 80 9 198 15 35 43 190	I bet dogs dream about things that the human mind could not comprehend.
190	149 131 173 193 178 15 150 114 135 129 190	The young man looks very happy to be performing his part.
190	57 180 105 46 133 73 70 171 176 113 190	A family that eats together, stays together.
190	178 138 199 160 183 196 157 174 52 38 190	I will walk with prestige with my team.
190	92 166 145 13 131 23 25 115 83 162 190	In thousands of years this temple will be turned to dust.
190	47 176 48 52 165 94 192 83 139 117 190	As the sun sets in the west, we prepare for the new beginnings of a new day
190	90 2 200 42 107 211 39 89 84 110 190	Deeply engaged in discussion... or argument?
190	107 181 43 99 21 22 194 13 152 180 190	The lights and the plants add an air of life into the space.
190	111 105 48 153 124 88 80 63 140 214 190	THE IMAGE IS VERY NICE ,THIS PLACE IS HILS PLACE
190	11 185 79 69 4 40 77 38 198 103 190	The wild cattle reminds me of the old west.
190	34 208 35 140 30 94 167 62 204 51 190	running a marathon is a testament to the human spirit
190	193 142 83 157 88 188 86 140 58 64 190	The stark white is perfect contrast matching the artists intentions.
190	163 199 189 36 39 74 106 187 22 210 190	That flower is a living thing man
190	2 70 29 95 107 184 11 71 89 159 190	Our lives come and go like the blooms of this tree.
190	113 63 167 191 168 147 101 210 103 64 190	Having a young man learn to respect at a young age will lead to fruitful life.
190	47 130 150 4 24 215 177 212 54 170 190	Ok, I have to listen very carefully for instructions.
190	50 24 183 126 43 49 187 113 4 21 190	This car will become a coffin for many. Drive safely.
190	61 44 21 51 131 35 180 92 40 207 190	this is the view of our god
190	123 98 167 20 135 106 37 93 183 181 190	This dog is looking into my soul.
190	17 84 147 186 111 23 180 148 168 192 190	This is an expression to the dark side of the Self and our detached relationship to it.
190	108 181 202 21 169 38 1 70 143 145 190	Maybe he died at that very spot and now eternally looks out at the ocean as a statue.

190	177 204 72 40 205 63 209 215 164 27 190	The purple smoke represents the cloud of mental agitation we are always lost within
190	118 155 151 55 72 2 163 135 65 87 190	Her singing was so beautiful that my soul was able to feel it.
190	7 98 55 139 147 182 145 100 1 124 190	My soul is whole here.
190	212 56 151 194 20 199 108 203 137 134 190	This feeling is like no other!
190	27 71 176 145 166 47 173 16 35 123 190	what an amazing photo
190	151 117 187 126 115 214 148 160 173 42 190	There is a profound reality in mountain climbing.
190	12 88 202 29 74 194 200 143 95 79 190	There is a lot one can learn from a sunset.
190	161 114 59 202 28 120 89 131 55 123 190	The same class trip is taken every year by the graduating class.
190	38 114 57 104 202 111 178 39 132 71 190	Wow going on an adventure
190	70 83 119 141 100 104 53 82 185 192 190	This picture is like a metaphor for life: living things growing over the remains of the dead.
190	90 166 214 215 159 102 208 28 31 168 190	I bet these two are related, you can sense a deep, familiar bond between them.
190	49 168 92 21 113 45 47 111 80 37 190	It reminds me of the depth of a lake on a sunny day.
190	30 159 191 38 194 214 61 100 195 167 190	The waves in the ocean picture represent life. You can either get knocked over by them. Or get knocked down, and pick yourself up to face the next one.
190	156 70 179 79 209 149 146 172 51 158 190	The travels of life gives us many rewards of gratitude.
190	3 136 18 29 14 201 31 187 157 214 190	The runners are chasing after the police, which is very ironic given the typical circumstances.
190	195 213 53 21 32 28 33 9 73 160 190	This statue is as deep in thought as the creator of it.
190	90 154 101 40 112 88 192 84 17 114 190	parents should not let children got so far away the number of abductions and the mere moments it takes for them to happen should keep them more aware
190	121 147 113 59 84 91 161 119 32 36 190	This is very indicative of the state of modern kids of divorce today.
190	128 69 32 95 53 157 207 3 130 172 190	Tiny stunted trees everywhere.
190	10 21 180 178 36 155 100 94 92 202 190	I don't dare think about who else has used this microphone recently.
190	206 184 28 139 127 38 152 13 114 129 190	The relationships formed in a small community do not compare to those formed in concrete cities.
190	63 58 149 114 135 96 157 168 123 29 190	I hope you guys are enjoying the food, it was a great presentation today well done team on all your efforts

190	192 55 179 210 160 163 91 75 49 198 190	They are having a very insightful conversation.
190	40 33 103 44 85 10 123 157 55 188 190	I HOPE I CAN SIT IN THIS TREE FOREVER AND TAKE IN THE BEAUTY.
190	36 16 27 109 3 129 140 99 28 183 190	This is why we need to recycle and save this Earth!
190	58 48 158 99 200 170 159 26 129 150 190	Small things, like these droplets, can make us lose focus.
190	10 164 165 208 168 23 136 195 181 98 190	A mentor can change your, it happens only if you believe in him!

191	162 174 84 47 121 179 215 25 207 109 191	I hope she didn't pay a lot of money for that trinket.
191	213 62 194 24 193 144 181 1 92 197 191	This reminds me of an investment property I was looking at downtown. I still can't decide

191	137 187 168 73 140 87 6 176 111 56 191	This building would be an excellent choice for a financial firm, it's tall height and metallic exterior exude confidence and would attract wealthy clients.
191	89 12 186 122 84 90 204 115 119 162 191	It is stingy to think about the coins in the fountain
191	190 213 214 31 7 194 187 34 62 12 191	this shell would look nice on my coffee table
191	142 146 27 105 127 6 192 15 153 42 191	You should be glad it's the 21st century. If you took these pictures in the 1990s you would have wasted so much money on film and developing. As it is, someone has to pay for the bandwidth you used to share this photo.
191	6 172 110 80 95 147 28 49 15 10 191	Expensive car on display
191	190 96 197 148 211 73 46 153 65 118 191	I would love to live here! Looks like a great area to save some money
191	115 185 173 127 12 136 201 97 85 111 191	I wonder how much it would cost to mine this.

191	146 158 183 110 168 116 50 211 82 121 191	That's gorgeous. Do any budget airlines fly there or would I be better off driving if gas prices stay low?
191	32 20 42 148 67 146 153 214 125 169 191	i could definitely sell that statue.
191	118 28 131 163 215 145 202 79 4 78 191	I love this fire pit, it saves us so much money on the gas bill.
191	42 169 177 109 80 73 161 135 110 167 191	Tubas like these are so valuable they've spawned their own black market.
191	182 192 156 211 44 206 27 66 184 190 191	A latticework like this would be time-consuming and expensive to make.
191	123 197 146 139 9 2 164 178 89 68 191	All of this time spent hanging out by the water could be better used to make money at a job.
191	71 139 68 207 108 94 52 19 184 121 191	I wonder if this musician has been signed to a major label yet.
191	187 35 80 16 29 92 82 144 39 100 191	I bet I could sell this orchid for $100.
191	140 210 44 67 20 91 130 26 170 7 191	Plan more for the future now than you think, it'll all be worth it.
191	150 84 8 126 139 96 202 114 40 188 191	These are highly expensive cigars.

191	209 69 213 103 134 80 79 150 172 63 191	My, what a collectible automobile!
191	94 116 26 95 167 208 86 54 198 170 191	I wonder how much the fine for the infraction will be for that person.
191	42 207 183 35 69 27 7 145 215 33 191	Cat's can be a very expensive pet to have.
191	179 42 144 206 16 166 60 172 68 44 191	It's going to cost too much to upgrade the storage unit with better roofing and to get rid of the termites in the wood.
191	28 208 24 13 155 143 159 42 105 206 191	I'm getting gains for this!

191	171 3 158 67 170 61 33 14 2 86 191	I hope that they are able to contribute financially to the service being held.

191	111 51 127 57 105 153 212 55 177 122 191	You'd have a mansion view rather than a street view if you were a self-centered, greedy CEO.
191	102 70 1 15 133 130 149 215 4 116 191	Wonder what deal they're about to make!
191	162 103 59 194 181 14 129 204 89 146 191	Get it boy! You need to bend your knees higher than that to beat this team.
191	171 162 196 27 188 57 89 106 208 60 191	Would make excellent mulch for gardening if ground up.
191	85 14 203 95 124 145 158 7 201 83 191	Head jerk, huh? I wonder how much that costs... probably too rich for my blood.
191	186 91 215 210 107 123 184 203 35 34 191	You can save money on the weekend by drinking cans of cheap beer on your way to the bar... and by refusing to buy neckties.

191	86 197 39 166 93 108 200 38 127 138 191	Hopefully it doesnt cost too much

191	51 182 76 69 86 34 128 161 83 45 191	That bike looks like it was a great investment.
191	152 86 44 21 54 18 127 93 105 213 191	You can't sell this property with this junk laying around.
191	81 12 139 67 169 207 79 126 109 215 191	If it doesn't need painting, it will save money.
191	121 58 123 164 143 35 117 158 63 113 191	We can build a private highway here and make money by tool
191	105 52 55 161 46 78 130 38 208 102 191	I'm glad I have him on stage at my club, it brings in a lot of people and means more cash for me!
191	139 182 36 52 148 11 151 50 140 91 191	This view would make for an awesome motivation poster, which would make me rich!
191	135 84 200 197 154 205 66 86 34 208 191	you should sell this picture
191	76 70 44 60 187 212 56 211 208 16 191	all toy makers are very concern about profit

191	116 31 45 84 74 106 8 160 136 99 191	I wonder how much a drink is here.
191	139 145 143 189 131 173 159 44 123 96 191	If all the seats were filled in the stadium the team could make millions.
191	101 70 21 189 32 47 73 36 5 7 191	Man he looks like he is making loads of cash while running the audio and lights, looks like a good opportunity!
191	2 159 97 38 87 13 137 100 113 130 191	Rent is expensive here
191	20 124 66 146 172 175 67 21 184 186 191	If he wins, I get to collect on my bet.
191	61 213 64 51 165 144 118 39 9 36 191	I cannot imagine wearing white shoes I paid for to walk through sand of any kind.
191	28 118 68 23 143 128 63 163 13 197 191	These types of beautiful locations are perfect for a cheap getaway.

191	164 189 97 51 121 130 107 19 47 211 191	You will never fly with the eagles is you keep partying with the turkeys
191	155 103 211 4 131 88 96 123 100 70 191	I bet that train track cost a lot.
191	135 3 173 50 115 66 155 160 187 105 191	Hopefully she grows up to be a lawyer or a doctor with a big house.
191	166 7 119 33 129 62 96 117 73 61 191	How could i make a profit from a photo like this?
191	99 205 127 92 66 18 37 182 211 43 191	These people will know a good deal when they hear it.
191	20 171 85 38 12 166 71 141 156 8 191	You're pictures are starting to turn out well, have you thought about charging for your work?
191	34 9 117 58 106 148 151 109 164 11 191	This must cost so much money.
191	59 142 114 204 94 84 172 70 55 116 191	Artifacts like this must be worth a fortune!
191	121 113 111 46 77 138 157 180 102 1 191	Now that's a gold mine!
191	80 203 58 85 134 209 20 146 204 149 191	I wonder how much this guy could make in college with his lacrosse skills.

191	173 14 164 145 93 155 102 21 144 12 191	I can think of about 50 ways I can come into this town and take advantage of the cheap labor.
191	72 201 136 134 146 41 70 32 173 128 191	I don't just see a lake, I see luxury lakeside townhomes spread all around the water!
191	186 18 150 4 199 202 108 204 200 169 191	This woman did not win the prize money
191	209 8 14 32 67 21 206 94 97 108 191	Those kids better not be wasting food to make that snowman, someone paid hard-earned money for that food.
191	185 201 141 88 199 194 11 135 114 144 191	Those walls can generate a lot of money if used well.
191	89 200 137 70 110 85 189 104 161 215 191	i see the couple who focus on money and money matters all

191	35 106 111 207 97 58 5 94 92 153 191	Hand crafted spears of those sorts could sell for a lot on Amazon.

191	49 186 66 177 145 89 62 7 155 13 191	You could probably fix that up and flip it for a nice profit.
191	32 180 82 89 104 42 13 12 50 65 191	$4.00 for a hotdog is way too much.
191	212 124 205 197 203 130 6 91 159 68 191	I hope he can afford equipment someday.
191	167 202 82 44 172 11 137 174 83 182 191	I can see it now, sitting in the chair, looking out over that beautiful view, and coming up with the next big "million dollar idea".

191	2 19 54 65 89 57 197 117 112 87 191	The lenses on these cameras should have good resale is you want a new one later
191	207 15 40 211 203 95 159 111 69 52 191	If these trees are cleared out they may be able to build a sizable shopping center.
191	170 46 65 160 102 45 151 174 122 53 191	How much did they pay to get on?
191	211 35 209 198 135 42 109 183 184 126 191	it's going to cost a fortune to remove those.
191	111 203 144 47 163 181 108 72 198 64 191	This would be a great view for a resort.
191	154 192 183 8 98 32 155 214 90 103 191	Having a grave like this must cost a pretty penny

191	21 142 23 95 102 146 200 183 98 100 191	Walking is so inefficient.  You need to get there faster so you can get to work and make more money.
191	158 108 56 150 151 26 149 179 22 41 191	Visiting and aquarium is expensive these days.
191	181 155 40 45 11 103 209 167 142 208 191	We can win
191	124 63 71 146 79 179 83 137 94 98 191	These girls might be great players, but I'm looking at thousands of dollars of equipment to help them play their best!

191	178 131 118 49 22 167 210 157 185 61 191	I wonder how much it would cost to install bricks like that at my house?
191	11 127 195 190 78 107 147 165 89 51 191	This must have takens hours of man power and so much money.
191	88 77 215 72 35 56 83 91 196 81 191	What a gorgeous dress, I wonder how much she spent on it.
191	106 195 204 99 101 81 212 189 141 9 191	I'm not giving anything to this church's collection plate
191	2 47 20 63 211 22 160 157 174 153 191	That seems like such a cheap, effective way to have a fun time! I'll have to write that down!

191	33 108 127 115 73 42 5 71 140 10 191	This is the last tree in the land for making paper.
191	169 4 15 171 44 173 114 23 58 141 191	It would be so expensive to own a monkey.
191	26 128 120 58 110 54 81 125 80 144 191	do you know how much it costs to get an airplane in the air each time?

191	59 121 62 193 86 64 174 176 156 46 191	That equipment costs a lot of money. He must be rich.

191	68 49 60 30 80 6 213 105 73 63 191	I could use this space more effectively.
191	144 99 73 25 26 168 115 155 18 121 191	You see bright lights and a party, I see door fee's and people buying my drinks all night!
191	133 94 147 38 137 82 171 68 125 214 191	What a hard working athlete, I would love to discuss management and investment opportunities with this guy!

191	116 159 156 189 74 104 196 142 57 78 191	Looks like a great place to build a water-front resort
191	43 10 21 99 66 82 128 157 90 167 191	These mosquitoes are making bank.
191	91 205 163 188 85 127 13 201 6 164 191	Is it more expensive to build a draw bridge or a higher one?  What is the cost effect for delaying traffic?

194	211 126 187 97 21 151 98 24 91 45 194	What a quaint looking area. If I were there I'd be sure to support the local businesses.
194	209 154 37 182 67 170 187 113 28 20 194	Nothing but the cool blue sea and daiquiris ahead!
194	33 179 90 131 212 113 116 144 31 5 194	I've loved animals of all types since I was a little boy
194	162 103 130 92 108 76 178 161 24 1 194	Have a nice trip to Oxford
194	208 38 170 101 211 90 186 143 212 193 194	There lies a loved one
194	182 187 104 145 43 82 195 20 56 13 194	These are the world champions, it's amazing how quick they are.
194	119 148 209 102 129 89 144 140 197 15 194	I'll bet this guy has a beautiful voice.
194	205 87 60 200 142 49 203 112 55 127 194	The color of candy
194	109 204 102 210 63 71 129 36 94 166 194	These girls look like they are very nice.
194	170 201 136 14 207 147 64 192 156 95 194	I feel bad for this womans window.
194	170 208 202 158 209 129 118 64 153 147 194	The sky is so pretty.
194	161 116 206 20 62 18 107 148 37 121 194	They look like they're having fun.
195	131 91 8 90 62 201 152 189 53 112 195	It's great to see Aunt Rose so upbeat after all the family drama.
195	87 47 183 140 153 94 143 81 135 50 195	Aw, looks very astute
195	84 212 130 173 34 74 190 149 183 185 195	So much wildlife was displaced for this wide open, dead space.
195	162 32 178 126 106 153 164 81 20 190 195	Good for all of them!
195	185 140 103 141 15 132 41 142 105 150 195	I hope the passengers in the plane can enjoy the beauty of the clouds.
195	114 27 179 106 126 100 52 110 79 20 195	The darkness makes me feel afraid.
195	80 30 148 152 133 69 191 144 143 188 195	The flower at the peak of its bloom before it falls apart just touches me somewhere deep.
195	8 83 168 157 33 78 213 84 177 39 195	I hope that he can breathe now with that tube.
195	181 45 122 101 100 127 155 89 204 206 195	You have to be very delicate not to kick someone in the head
195	91 90 169 123 151 63 111 164 165 200 195	Look at all this beautiful greenery
195	102 97 47 147 133 40 17 120 109 139 195	They're doing their best, must have worked out a lot.
195	140 136 143 31 152 148 160 67 12 20 195	This looks like the perfect spot for a romantic picnic.
195	79 134 59 75 37 119 67 132 121 181 195	The woman is thoughtful
195	167 52 93 140 88 67 209 4 143 87 195	These feet look like they need a massage, they’re tired hard working feet
195	160 53 159 43 95 193 77 80 134 147 195	This image isn't detailed enough, I can't read the map.
195	57 196 3 190 162 129 78 52 40 21 195	Donald Duck is my favorite cartoon character, I always feel such emotion seeing him.
195	15 144 197 196 140 39 57 210 42 93 195	Thinking about Tedx is upsetting.
195	188 57 114 56 72 141 148 179 192 21 195	Oh no! I hope everyone is ok!
195	1 134 3 71 163 95 4 108 109 159 195	This is so beautiful!
195	144 201 7 179 14 56 174 38 196 109 195	I'm allergic to cheese!
195	87 116 66 34 162 13 106 33 120 41 195	This woman is beautiful.
195	136 94 99 148 155 179 187 164 167 34 195	I want all animals to have homes.
195	83 141 96 59 200 7 212 180 99 78 195	This is a really beautiful black and white photo.
195	119 210 60 87 171 15 95 178 182 2 195	He must be enjoying that mountainous scenery.
195	119 108 198 54 101 134 116 42 6 210 195	This plant seem to be dying.
195	166 76 156 114 168 11 15 48 38 177 195	How could you not be conscious of the beauty of the surrounding mountains
195	27 181 130 118 92 189 125 15 40 174 195	A delicate moment for that rebel
195	63 33 61 154 59 71 95 77 161 49 195	I am so proud of you, it makes me cry!
195	150 200 109 46 58 54 13 165 60 203 195	I really hope she didn't sing the song about her mother. It makes me cry to even think of it.
195	36 130 194 120 50 153 106 48 29 186 195	I hope he's careful! Those cars are dangerous
195	215 181 89 90 116 20 114 27 29 70 195	This church brings me much pain when I think about it, many of my worst years were spent here.
195	10 60 107 133 7 143 93 26 211 210 195	ouch that hurt
195	22 50 107 8 127 41 79 97 11 42 195	What a nice secluded place for peace of mind.
195	128 202 208 81 172 163 43 120 176 69 195	I feel that one airplane is in the other airplane's personal space, plus the people on top may be in danger.
195	115 183 199 45 1 186 215 103 168 124 195	Being an aging man and somehow still being relegated to dressing like a pirate for money... It is a sad state of affairs.
195	17 50 104 164 132 210 161 154 6 101 195	That may be someone's service dog.
195	29 48 6 118 16 39 123 138 121 172 195	This is just beautiful!
195	51 26 100 91 11 154 134 166 83 19 195	Be careful! You might fall!
195	39 151 81 102 160 66 121 107 37 77 195	What an honor to earn these awards.
195	9 3 185 107 64 157 163 17 73 16 195	The expressions of the animal-hybrids in this image are a little intimidating and scary.
195	35 205 185 176 106 40 208 178 13 173 195	I can't visit this building without crying because it is my childhood church
195	36 152 201 136 40 185 8 81 78 142 195	It's going to hurt really bad when I ball. I'm going to feel it for weeks.
195	151 126 94 152 117 38 200 175 104 24 195	The color of this building irritates my eyes on a bright sunny day.
195	187 157 2 20 28 97 85 73 191 77 195	I am not a fan of private rooms, they make me sad.
195	87 212 124 202 180 40 66 15 12 11 195	I hope they don't catch a cold.
195	2 176 36 212 157 19 116 9 30 111 195	Better safe than sorry.
195	196 126 62 31 39 158 105 14 170 73 195	Oh no, only one more strike will end the game; I'd feel so bad for the pitcher because he will feel it's all his fault that they lost.
195	146 50 215 171 6 16 211 95 130 97 195	I remember my grandma made the best corn I've ever had.
195	104 103 131 201 210 149 190 207 208 127 195	Please don't misuse the equipment! I would hate to see a good machine damaged.
195	19 29 106 33 40 30 133 6 199 75 195	That land should be used for nature not man made objects
195	175 119 44 21 198 125 128 84 114 117 195	The first time I saw this band live it nearly brought me to tears it was so beautiful
195	212 52 182 19 77 176 178 189 16 75 195	The view looks nice
195	100 43 75 171 152 78 46 134 3 128 195	The hotel with a large horse was always the midpoint for me and my family when we took coast to coast roadtrips.
195	194 45 72 197 162 29 124 145 34 142 195	They all look like they're having a wonderful time! Godspeed!
195	36 97 99 22 24 87 211 77 104 72 195	I hope it is not too hot outside for you guys today.
195	99 62 179 92 121 196 3 206 141 165 195	They need to be careful not to drink so much.
195	58 108 95 148 14 61 157 118 208 203 195	White on black and brown.
195	143 61 80 72 116 175 132 20 136 79 195	Things just seem so busy there...
195	57 201 204 172 111 147 48 60 193 50 195	Enjoy your skating
195	170 51 94 141 156 84 171 77 113 187 195	OMG kittens are born on trees?!
195	97 145 188 126 207 6 84 190 23 198 195	The love of a cat that trusts you is one of the best feelings
195	16 47 108 183 181 157 69 55 3 115 195	This church is a little scary.
195	207 111 85 154 189 107 203 44 117 16 195	This reminds me of my sad clown days.
195	60 75 13 133 51 89 175 17 9 49 195	I love how the camera picked up on the sun and it looks like three pink dots adorn the men's heads, almost like an angel.
195	106 192 209 211 171 118 63 109 198 110 195	The snake looks scary.
195	61 7 167 202 84 57 76 176 6 93 195	I didn't have the heart to tell her it wasn't the TARDIS. She's colour blind.
195	98 181 197 136 146 39 58 166 28 172 195	This would be a good snack for those in need.
195	212 184 66 215 47 171 136 42 83 115 195	This Santa looks really sad. I wonder what's wrong?
195	83 90 80 89 67 88 201 34 127 37 195	We are very excited about our boat tour to see all the city has to offer.
195	58 101 18 201 155 194 108 80 36 198 195	This picture really speaks to my soul
195	62 96 66 210 132 128 19 68 46 147 195	This picture really touches my soul look how peaceful it is
195	141 110 145 130 180 189 14 202 39 48 195	i feel sorry for her girl friend crying
195	93 201 138 200 51 175 126 177 210 139 195	Hold me tight!
195	79 128 186 24 120 164 56 178 193 70 195	That deer is so sweet I hope it does not get shot.
195	162 42 157 186 136 56 188 33 123 102 195	I'm sad seeing this car.
195	212 137 14 178 19 169 153 185 172 45 195	This broken machine makes me sad.
195	214 215 2 198 121 97 39 18 88 127 195	What a lovely photograph, these two really care for each other, I'm so pleased.
195	114 154 181 17 87 210 214 178 118 89 195	We would have more landscapes like this if we didn't ruin our planet.
195	5 211 170 191 8 207 101 147 84 126 195	These are so beautiful that they make me want to cry
195	122 60 26 11 141 175 49 82 84 3 195	Why do we kill so many of our preciosu animals for food.
195	146 55 173 213 207 157 74 7 200 20 195	That is a lovely backdrop celebrating the wedding ceremony.  I hope they are happy together.
195	202 145 154 112 72 24 115 85 31 177 195	I don't believe that this is beneficial in any way
195	156 185 5 76 61 174 196 205 25 187 195	the green of the trees, the blue of the sky somehow takes me back to a time when thing were calmer less rushed more free
195	103 83 192 114 38 4 23 205 181 31 195	Peaceful grass-fed cattle. The way things should be.
195	49 10 179 84 176 118 145 122 18 182 195	There is something special about waiting  on the train that always makes you feel connected to everyone around you.
195	106 128 33 35 160 16 52 87 209 61 195	I just feel running in marathons really dosen't help the causes people are running for
195	52 18 152 121 75 177 80 147 77 190 195	I hope no one falls down this well.
195	86 17 72 190 26 211 146 39 30 63 195	so happy to see you four together again!
195	50 167 214 24 114 138 112 128 101 91 195	I really hope he lets her try too. She really wants to! It's not fair.
195	34 168 60 12 86 145 8 1 96 21 195	I don't really like how this promotes us destroying delicate nature
195	180 170 208 138 84 27 98 65 13 11 195	It's almost like a scene straight from my childhood.
195	105 140 199 109 93 15 203 89 22 52 195	Green is a very calming colour.
195	128 156 190 104 148 118 93 146 111 20 195	We are all as delicate as this cactus, aching for nourishment, but able to live without it.
195	1 201 16 145 42 47 118 63 108 158 195	I cry only of remembering the beutiful memories at this scene.
195	109 110 21 170 106 58 6 62 188 176 195	What a lovely portrait of friendship
195	37 207 30 71 157 97 146 148 129 93 195	It is just a small show to most, but to me, this is the debut of a play by a long lost friend.
195	5 95 132 156 56 191 64 31 55 114 195	These children have survived so much, it's nice to see them happy and smiling.
195	17 143 101 51 32 180 53 16 47 141 195	This runner will need an ice bath after the sprints today.
195	102 22 186 62 58 214 56 59 201 35 195	You have a great, original smile.
195	163 96 80 173 25 152 78 150 87 204 195	what a perfect clear click
195	176 76 208 197 192 193 78 68 147 58 195	This man must enjoy being up at the microphone, he looks so focused.
195	149 125 192 131 81 205 142 164 64 134 195	We are on a boat yeah!
195	203 12 162 13 160 131 188 182 112 118 195	Those lights are hurting my eyes, turn them off!
195	187 184 162 91 127 141 209 29 26 99 195	Good thing the sun is not shining bright
195	17 93 137 61 43 165 41 74 119 209 195	Thats really cute
195	152 201 158 78 18 139 171 44 112 80 195	These old Rangefinder cameras allow for way more flexibility when it comes to light exposure than any modern day digital gadget.
195	98 31 141 3 172 26 79 105 101 160 195	The pinks and reds are so lovely and reminders of love in the world
195	120 141 56 154 140 110 47 80 103 187 195	The cat should have a water dish of its own.
195	193 19 206 23 55 211 30 6 107 178 195	Look at my dinner that my handsome fiance ordered. #Blessed.
195	208 197 209 24 130 107 78 1 25 150 195	I am so happy for them!
195	15 116 72 40 201 186 97 22 175 59 195	I hope the water doesn't disturb any of the wildlife!
195	162 17 11 88 124 150 66 191 164 212 195	I'm glad to see that someone isn't interested in only scaring people with masks!
195	161 89 164 167 30 214 104 70 58 24 195	bright, lights ,skyline
195	85 132 204 24 148 149 16 51 186 45 195	I hope the person taking the picture doesn't startle him
195	61 196 83 119 1 15 157 37 129 199 195	How sweet to share an umbrella; there's always room when you take the time to think about one another.
195	126 36 201 203 38 204 93 83 119 211 195	the smoothness of the water makes me want to cry.
195	193 141 19 96 74 1 160 152 162 103 195	Respect to those who have lost loved ones to war.
195	98 175 43 142 42 72 111 67 6 194 195	I feel bad for this man, whatever he is protesting must mean a lot to him.
195	123 12 83 207 85 169 23 105 15 155 195	The beauty of the natural setting moves me to tears.
195	42 177 123 209 174 95 82 84 148 149 195	This kid has courage standing up in front of everyone.
195	137 169 11 151 196 197 174 156 117 29 195	I hope you finds a nice comfortable seat soon.
195	114 183 187 52 51 146 163 33 171 15 195	The guy in the blue looks injured, I hope he is okay.
195	10 6 71 157 156 117 200 109 114 4 195	The look of that creature makes me feel quite uncomfortable.
195	31 124 44 199 157 140 133 29 177 95 195	How do you think the trees feel about being so close to the advertisements?

198	75 110 115 159 104 143 107 194 137 135 198	Sometimes I just want to get naked and jump in the river.
198	153 103 139 53 128 70 85 108 5 182 198	This looks like too many veggies, gross.

198	36 129 27 77 88 145 202 114 160 23 198	I want to throw melted crayons on this wall.
198	206 102 22 163 215 18 159 195 97 74 198	This looks like a clown car.
198	134 3 70 54 118 37 162 112 49 50 198	I would ride that bike
198	209 37 126 163 11 10 160 60 132 40 198	I bet I could throw popcorn on the front row!
198	140 206 99 189 119 37 22 67 157 176 198	I cannot wait to get to bike down this huge hill!

198	82 196 30 157 79 55 173 206 122 37 198	I would climb that sign
198	35 145 165 182 181 54 115 200 102 169 198	I want to first in that line.
198	112 41 105 168 181 113 53 38 86 138 198	I hope you drop you'r violin and break it.
198	145 63 58 85 128 95 72 118 8 113 198	I bet she is nice.
198	58 132 157 105 151 173 162 44 116 209 198	Those dogs are so cute!!
198	191 22 100 125 194 159 21 184 17 167 198	This fun is for kids only.
198	43 186 201 120 76 197 84 163 122 128 198	I think the mountains are super pretty.

198	185 64 79 206 172 209 13 56 65 90 198	I would love to roll down that hill in an office chair!
198	36 128 85 117 120 44 9 4 72 101 198	I want to skate down these stairs.
198	181 201 103 78 148 37 184 20 211 102 198	I would steal that sign and keep it in my room!
198	69 159 46 43 36 184 122 145 207 42 198	I wonder if anyone back-washed into that water.
198	75 125 145 18 185 156 22 131 26 109 198	I don't know where her hair ends and her hat begins!
198	70 109 168 208 213 104 119 112 29 84 198	My roommate keeps eating my leftovers so I took all of his stuff.
198	136 193 134 157 68 93 53 19 127 48 198	I want to climb that tower.
198	170 85 193 25 56 135 30 131 67 152 198	Why can't I wear just a diaper to swim?
198	42 49 178 74 2 1 100 188 31 183 198	I would be scared to be talking and would imagine the audience in their underwear.
198	129 204 213 56 123 32 143 63 2 206 198	Baby girl curls! How precious!
198	31 85 160 165 159 32 126 44 213 71 198	What are they all looking at?

198	78 112 188 55 77 180 29 21 164 63 198	The bullets go bang bang.

198	200 119 140 207 168 128 88 177 60 92 198	I wanna play pretend bride!
198	78 122 180 157 101 46 69 183 15 17 198	This looks like a scene out of Moana!
198	10 116 99 132 170 143 119 65 101 30 198	I remember the time I went skiing in my backyard.
198	12 60 154 169 85 80 133 192 18 172 198	Hey look up in the sky! It's a bird, it's a plane, no it's Big Bird from Sesame Street!
198	127 45 34 12 123 200 23 135 92 112 198	Maybe if she weren't arching her back she'd look mroe natural.

198	19 120 172 151 34 213 73 109 100 166 198	This is the way Little Red Riding Hood went to Grandma's house, huh?
198	80 28 40 73 213 95 166 94 78 85 198	I can't read this language, this is pointless to me.
198	196 14 112 138 195 161 87 155 21 64 198	they look like Peter Pan yeah
198	161 171 73 140 191 99 124 7 202 175 198	It's not fair he gets all the attention.  My birthday was yesterday, but nobody gave me anything.
198	75 68 115 138 91 47 57 195 85 51 198	The heck is that? I can't read that!

198	77 189 193 13 97 155 127 135 61 67 198	A park is for kids for life!
198	189 50 195 118 175 125 7 213 151 197 198	Kids'll have fun where they want.

198	126 14 153 55 184 91 109 182 111 194 198	That is considered a snack in some countries
198	2 27 145 210 164 183 194 48 171 25 198	That old guy has so much acne his wife looks like his mom.
198	63 77 66 31 60 19 128 174 41 2 198	HAhaha! That drawing looks stupid!

198	146 135 178 181 32 72 94 139 115 43 198	This reminds me when I use to run up and down the subway as a child. I still do it sometimes...but only late at night when no one is there.
198	120 110 132 200 55 15 67 107 32 206 198	My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty!
198	155 139 3 41 56 106 196 168 54 172 198	Well that plan seems complex.
198	176 10 89 33 85 134 100 36 155 130 198	Her nose makes her look dorky.
198	66 185 106 25 54 122 19 164 179 17 198	I like the plane.

198	22 115 186 26 208 122 201 133 131 169 198	That monkey is awesome!
198	131 126 168 5 197 206 163 50 69 133 198	The beauty salon won't be very beautiful after I make a mess inside of it.
198	1 120 137 3 128 99 78 26 37 111 198	Look at this silly little dog why does he sleep with signs on his face all day ha ha ha.
198	174 95 151 206 103 107 175 88 204 170 198	Haha what losers sitting on the steps.
198	121 38 195 26 35 70 162 144 61 207 198	I think they are miners.
198	110 146 71 39 169 36 54 211 191 202 198	She needs to get out of the way I'm trying to look at the seal.
198	8 145 146 5 91 149 49 61 140 94 198	That lady is gonna puke if he keeps sticking fingers down there.
198	65 154 207 8 174 177 142 99 156 146 198	Watch out for poop below!
198	139 171 103 71 98 84 157 57 38 180 198	Hahaha those girls r cuties
198	44 20 46 101 120 38 92 42 103 191 198	The sky looks yellow.
198	173 164 214 98 139 143 190 85 204 48 198	I want to play. Why cant I play with them?
198	132 29 190 144 68 152 161 41 50 90 198	Hey, can you give me a hand? Hahah
198	199 135 101 95 203 10 180 16 193 42 198	I don't think I'd want to share the car with my stupid brother, either.
198	47 48 117 73 5 126 25 210 168 100 198	Wow all guys, that place looks like a sausage fest!
198	33 105 102 98 93 132 73 103 174 116 198	I would love to find these laying in the grass and eat them.
198	140 121 197 70 190 24 195 122 107 92 198	White bird drinking
198	142 89 122 129 124 101 91 135 205 184 198	This definitely looks like a party from when I was a kid
198	179 196 71 157 106 195 154 211 121 50 198	I was here once, it got so loud that I started stomping my feet and almost cried.
198	44 150 106 189 185 88 136 180 182 119 198	Go jump in the water!!
198	138 122 178 9 38 23 54 85 215 12 198	This would be perfect if there were snowmen everywhere.
198	75 86 69 61 152 148 103 7 211 126 198	I just want to run up and down those stairs!
198	91 100 118 180 45 40 175 60 55 94 198	If I was there, I'd totally prank the heck outta them!
198	146 90 203 180 15 115 34 81 12 76 198	I love stealing the soap and stuff from the hotel room, what are they gonna do about it!?
198	23 71 12 32 6 117 45 179 24 113 198	Those pillars are so long and hard... that's what she said! Haha!
198	9 129 84 50 121 197 135 214 53 139 198	Trut me. He was the flyest kid in class that day.
198	33 53 145 44 22 60 7 14 185 110 198	These would be great people to play with.
198	175 149 9 84 59 159 42 1 85 154 198	A kid must have shaved this animal!
198	157 89 58 143 77 144 46 4 202 27 198	The pattern looks like the tiles in my grandma's bathroom.
198	157 104 106 94 171 83 127 43 110 149 198	This looks like a door to a fairy tale world!
198	45 53 190 25 147 5 150 185 97 13 198	is it me , or is this pic side ways ? i cant tell. someone tell me.
198	61 39 140 121 41 141 193 91 192 102 198	Gosh, I would get lost in a city that big!
198	158 88 124 166 181 76 184 120 197 73 198	That is some beautiful grass. I would love to roll around in it.
198	120 7 164 206 149 124 150 8 194 63 198	I could do better and don't like this.
198	128 208 25 170 55 105 93 185 36 153 198	Can we swim?
198	3 116 11 194 31 95 187 214 63 128 198	I bet elves live in these woods.
198	168 98 10 194 187 138 150 120 56 185 198	Look at those dumb knifes. LOL.
198	87 85 39 118 197 169 65 29 75 24 198	Is this an id card?
198	84 113 32 48 117 136 114 149 210 150 198	Those are such pretty colors!
198	140 11 67 120 4 31 143 91 191 41 198	Hold your strings you bog babies.
198	210 183 203 80 180 112 111 53 75 85 198	I like red and even blue, but never purple!
198	192 63 107 159 50 91 117 171 54 83 198	Look at that really big, really fast airplane!
198	58 170 40 129 5 106 2 93 191 185 198	look at her bulky teeth sticking out when she smiles, wheres her bottom roq?
198	137 170 54 131 195 206 208 104 122 112 198	This house has a lot of weird pictures.
198	178 104 21 75 133 107 200 85 179 16 198	That would be fun to pretend its a pair of binoculars.
198	104 181 208 152 63 133 119 99 90 39 198	This looks like a super fun ramp that we can slide right down.
198	130 127 15 150 27 199 60 214 193 99 198	all alone in a rock at a pine forest.. how unappealing
198	158 60 103 105 111 174 35 97 188 51 198	Woah, I could totally skateboard around these stores!
198	177 131 10 82 47 180 44 42 184 85 198	I wanna go swim in there!
198	190 70 44 55 178 76 137 101 189 74 198	I want to get out on the field and play too!
198	22 106 2 91 114 146 209 13 131 12 198	She doesn't even look up for the camera.
198	18 110 71 189 182 203 114 132 184 72 198	You could splash if you fell off!
198	109 65 201 126 204 186 94 54 120 133 198	There isn't enough snow for a snowman!
198	69 141 115 27 112 6 108 106 83 65 198	Those glasses are dorky.
198	149 142 175 11 18 113 151 115 105 97 198	Wow the woman looks way older than the man. Probably illegal for them to date.
198	23 176 142 94 146 110 106 84 168 91 198	Let's swim all summer vacation long
198	10 203 207 107 164 7 83 206 8 104 198	This looks like my robot best friend
198	119 23 75 189 17 137 29 58 182 8 198	I wish I could jump right in that water
198	32 24 54 78 178 116 117 155 2 48 198	Look at those stupid buildings. Look like two big wieners tickling the sky.
198	47 209 42 187 33 114 7 85 53 151 198	Awww! So cute! I want a kitty so bad!
198	196 215 46 206 81 96 112 133 186 178 198	I wanna frollic here!
198	49 159 163 59 84 190 83 54 121 154 198	Mommy, are sand sharks make of sand?
198	194 34 2 179 120 58 208 174 41 102 198	That green is so dark and yucky.
198	80 50 130 156 195 30 133 181 18 214 198	I want cuddles with that little ball of fur!
198	88 156 37 165 175 47 144 200 199 8 198	Oh I want to take a picture in the car!
198	115 118 20 185 186 48 129 153 122 182 198	What a silly man, he's going to spill it and then he'll be in trouble.
198	105 22 205 66 184 24 213 83 67 175 198	Those clouds look cool!
198	213 127 86 34 137 160 126 3 44 187 198	Push the stick
198	133 124 121 188 158 95 139 86 29 10 198	Who knocked over my sign?
198	37 110 162 36 5 166 42 210 69 168 198	I can ride MY bike with no handlebars. Better than him.
198	148 61 168 100 69 78 126 149 64 120 198	Those towers look like spider legs
198	104 105 117 74 110 172 45 22 209 68 198	ITS GOD OMG
199	189 105 208 179 87 163 165 184 30 2 199	My heart is open to new experiences, much like these cobbled streets invite anyone to walk them.
199	137 162 131 123 197 177 58 201 169 140 199	Does he give drum lessons? I'd like to try...
199	215 142 198 107 157 93 71 182 19 57 199	The dragonfly would be free if the person let it go
199	209 6 104 146 90 35 173 182 88 91 199	this looks so dangerous.
199	205 110 175 187 42 169 119 92 210 154 199	I think this is a really cool crow pic.
199	164 140 67 104 20 2 206 201 103 188 199	I have a family, similar looking to this one, and I never thought I could have something like that in my life.
199	159 134 10 163 36 53 201 87 194 56 199	My office is next door. Come see me!
199	174 191 53 158 79 44 176 162 154 166 199	The steam is unsecure
199	111 45 138 118 214 53 88 172 80 110 199	I don't know what this place is, but I would love to visit it!
199	52 16 148 190 86 28 78 205 30 14 199	Stunning. Confidence is beauty.
199	99 14 196 24 133 2 128 78 113 202 199	All the colors of the rainbow?  Maybe a sunset against the ocean?
199	114 61 186 158 134 74 148 34 33 182 199	Did you build the birdhouse yourself?
199	214 212 179 93 40 150 124 208 213 99 199	I love all kinds of fish, regardless of looks or personality.
199	202 103 44 46 66 160 161 60 171 110 199	The beauty of the world is perplexing.
199	48 38 203 93 198 74 159 51 113 156 199	It is good to feel free
199	184 157 196 42 52 113 69 155 87 26 199	The outside world is full of life and possibilities
199	64 26 54 125 6 99 195 186 44 52 199	What a lovely photo! Everyone please remember these happy faces when you're having a bad day! That engaging smile, that arm around the waist, truly a blessed pair of siblings!
199	213 97 190 27 196 66 159 15 36 51 199	I would love to meet this group of people.  I want to see their set of skills
199	212 66 165 4 106 187 110 185 36 16 199	Beautiful clothes! I love and welcome all cultures across the world.
199	140 197 129 170 204 90 155 196 83 80 199	Ok, I will go down there with you with a flashlight.
199	104 11 162 70 108 179 119 152 86 109 199	I think this color is very deep and romantic.
199	60 1 56 48 71 52 158 164 152 208 199	It's always nice to see the sea, and the land that surrounds it.
199	8 180 145 185 168 142 174 65 116 147 199	Would love to visit this place someday!
199	95 47 30 69 29 68 56 202 134 79 199	That place looks so nice to just relax and walk
199	168 36 92 155 201 114 119 95 87 91 199	The cage must be unfastened
199	206 135 103 208 21 174 157 80 192 58 199	The man is free to pick whatever vegetable he wants
199	150 100 38 166 121 111 36 194 212 74 199	This is a very quaint building.
199	173 27 78 32 55 88 44 158 38 51 199	I would consider taking this duck in as a pet.
199	123 81 106 146 138 14 70 189 83 53 199	I would try these strawberries before washing them.
199	70 66 149 182 152 175 180 193 176 128 199	It's nice to see old people poking ducks with sticks.
199	58 89 138 10 162 13 135 193 203 71 199	Exploring new places is the key to a happy life.
199	210 167 208 34 4 116 132 198 67 109 199	This ski guy is having a blast
199	207 163 80 162 133 25 111 185 45 198 199	Oh what's going on here?
199	166 49 192 23 187 122 109 143 66 194 199	I would love to travel here and try all of these wines!
199	33 144 42 195 193 127 49 148 8 152 199	In a sea of buildings some may feel trapped, but I feel free.
199	194 151 61 155 160 25 26 78 201 70 199	The sky is so clear, it gives the sense of a large open area.
199	124 178 50 21 155 108 42 69 181 184 199	This seems like a bad view from my room, but I will make the best of it.
199	116 73 102 34 5 66 10 130 158 150 199	These guys may be great at rugby.
199	20 149 183 36 99 70 91 15 67 75 199	the outside is so open
199	134 200 74 119 11 5 31 188 192 60 199	look at the cure squirrel!
199	172 136 14 84 215 195 56 208 10 81 199	flower or eggs?
199	19 186 194 140 98 32 37 24 14 155 199	I know Google is an evil company, but I'm willing to let them have another go to win my support.
199	97 133 1 179 108 74 127 50 93 33 199	Would love for someone to explain what this thing did
199	150 152 37 28 151 17 3 90 9 70 199	Looks pretty dirty, needs a wash me message
199	42 7 110 22 86 41 32 215 59 186 199	The view looks calm
199	34 166 175 29 110 36 204 164 159 170 199	That looks like fun
199	164 38 158 96 161 131 136 2 95 46 199	What is it?
199	160 79 22 36 194 177 196 200 206 210 199	Come here duck!
199	182 214 139 152 92 190 144 107 2 85 199	I just love being outside like this with nothing obstructing our views.
199	78 152 3 202 56 191 118 125 198 107 199	The more colourful the house, the more it will attract free thinkers.
199	82 152 147 167 89 177 85 198 140 215 199	This looks like such a neat time to be alive. Love the old cars!
199	25 99 116 74 130 55 2 184 163 54 199	So much wide open space.
199	71 128 51 110 209 20 161 39 165 42 199	Love it ! wide open spaces for open minded people.
199	197 212 114 119 28 63 20 122 179 74 199	I wonder what's on his mind, poor little fellow. You have to keep talking.
199	215 67 25 179 50 22 109 68 176 129 199	Why not stick your hand in a pumpkin?
199	168 9 65 111 189 64 171 24 4 207 199	He looks slightly upset. I wish I could talk to him to find out why and help him.
199	8 57 99 33 125 166 11 200 73 144 199	i personally like the structures with a bautiful location as well as with the area that is easily accessible to the atmosphere .
199	118 121 16 190 111 17 146 22 61 117 199	This looks like something I could try.
199	76 18 160 128 154 170 98 90 129 131 199	It's a nice day to meet at the beach.
199	196 176 167 63 42 173 110 79 179 163 199	I have never taken karate, but I would be willing to try and learn it
199	14 110 107 63 35 12 8 99 139 188 199	Because he got high.
199	212 16 48 78 35 169 74 14 29 190 199	I'm not sure what this is, but I'm excited to try it.
199	176 69 19 36 168 215 165 97 78 54 199	The guy is showing his new invention, no matter that he is so young!
199	117 131 17 88 113 76 37 91 214 6 199	These folks are enjoying the great wide open.
199	140 62 38 152 156 5 155 39 211 118 199	I love seeing purple in nature
199	106 111 162 181 47 83 41 95 34 124 199	Let's have a fair game boys!
199	138 182 157 191 185 60 213 14 114 10 199	As a photographer this picture brings back so many lovely memories!
199	46 104 185 129 193 96 50 25 179 143 199	Don't lose a kid
199	10 169 131 2 136 215 45 47 142 104 199	The day could bring us anything.
199	145 104 197 163 125 88 168 213 72 33 199	Love to see everyone having fun.
199	164 82 93 68 102 205 84 23 202 150 199	I'd love to explore that cool space!
199	192 180 35 120 121 95 4 176 58 33 199	I will most likely eat lunch here every day to taste the whole menu.
199	72 69 144 102 17 157 213 194 189 126 199	Man this concert is amazing, what do you think man?
199	146 147 66 164 72 184 185 177 83 187 199	It appears an open group of adults of any gender and age.
199	25 80 210 162 166 35 165 12 22 158 199	I would move out to a place like this.
199	203 30 89 182 146 92 136 119 116 160 199	I would be willing to check it out
199	21 32 136 79 209 66 20 94 141 80 199	I would be willing to walk all the way to the farthest building.
199	41 191 10 207 193 158 156 15 52 169 199	I've never had this, but I'll give it a try sometime.
199	207 213 146 120 11 4 54 155 196 76 199	Historic churches have a lot to offer communities.
199	152 204 121 4 101 131 68 210 157 64 199	Meeting another person is the key to finding a reflection of oneself.
199	38 54 207 134 91 155 136 53 108 143 199	I got to be honest, I am not a fan of the red here.
199	182 111 139 17 132 161 127 159 5 86 199	Sniffing my toilet plunger is my new obsession. I think about toilet plunging all day and then after my last plumbing job is done I can't wait to plunge my face in one.
199	58 79 19 133 186 13 147 56 114 201 199	Still unsure whether ghosts exist...
199	152 1 142 48 194 86 50 160 90 42 199	Really interested where this was taken!
199	127 133 84 135 212 112 72 54 137 73 199	I'm allergic to flowers but this one could be okay for me.
199	153 166 196 208 149 54 143 98 161 201 199	I would climb that ladder if asked.
199	62 175 204 61 169 21 181 158 170 133 199	Looks like a nice place to be! I wanna go there
199	57 196 209 135 179 76 115 215 195 33 199	This tree is the oldest in the forest!
199	105 166 46 33 198 41 5 160 140 126 199	I see this a lot where I live. The tree continues to grow around the barbed wire until it becomes part of it.
199	205 29 132 146 21 28 10 46 103 143 199	I would eat these animals if asked.
199	126 192 128 156 55 122 175 48 36 178 199	Roses are wonderful.
199	126 209 110 143 94 206 30 2 19 146 199	those are rotten fruits
199	196 94 165 202 32 63 115 107 134 76 199	I would love to talk to this woman about her experience in this beautiful place.
199	55 11 47 139 108 56 156 113 211 172 199	A lot of Inputs, everything is posibile
199	194 54 91 26 103 53 170 165 37 189 199	WE ARE HERE ON VACATION AND WE ARE MARRIED
199	188 66 144 10 31 165 131 148 95 195 199	ROLLER COASTERS ARE MY FAVORITE LET'S GO HAVE FUN!
199	49 34 90 8 125 55 204 1 167 19 199	I am open to new ideas always, lets talk it over.
199	84 5 38 102 187 164 9 206 25 174 199	They look like they are having fun
199	112 16 89 97 196 128 192 86 49 59 199	reminds me of my brother, he should go for to
199	184 117 52 76 104 126 147 132 81 178 199	We should support those folks.
199	173 83 119 154 89 171 190 153 108 30 199	What a nice day!
199	56 25 134 200 64 112 160 189 127 212 199	These guys are playing in an unusual place, but it probably adds to the experience and makes it unique.
199	14 126 28 195 166 87 80 191 25 209 199	I am pleased that everyone has access to technology.
199	86 64 146 42 200 208 16 203 12 125 199	He should not do that wheelie.
199	32 6 131 50 182 120 204 173 106 169 199	A unique style by a sculpture
199	99 173 48 7 11 180 65 26 69 186 199	I am ready to go and protect
199	165 194 20 140 169 161 2 182 146 17 199	What a beautiful place, I'd like to see it in person
199	181 84 202 82 120 7 106 121 170 33 199	I wish I read Mandarin, wonder what's in there?
199	139 18 55 171 194 212 33 8 81 10 199	Aw, this hug really warms my heart!
199	137 103 181 72 200 174 208 161 87 195 199	They look very friendly.
199	142 97 187 180 34 29 91 116 148 33 199	She looks very happy and genuine.
199	63 195 52 11 142 165 4 117 70 150 199	I should ask them for a pen.
199	206 154 93 91 191 2 116 146 181 135 199	That player is a gifted talent.
199	202 193 157 84 6 145 136 88 114 80 199	I've been there.  Not the best place.  Not the worst.
199	67 138 57 70 64 177 20 98 35 32 199	I hope he has a bright and wonderful future.
199	102 179 112 124 189 81 117 187 84 167 199	Wow lots of people out
199	55 7 128 182 65 50 137 63 156 193 199	I would like to give that ride a try.
199	214 186 120 212 142 150 117 25 37 96 199	I'm not usually a fan of weird pictures, but I like this one.
199	183 124 209 186 159 62 187 179 86 51 199	I like this group of people.
199	119 107 4 152 78 202 196 39 68 181 199	I don't normally tell people this, but I've wanted to go to an event like this for so long.
199	182 212 16 56 112 180 17 31 215 84 199	A person who has a dog is the greatest person ever!
199	143 31 144 7 196 124 150 172 102 85 199	I'll admit that this is where I got the idea for my redesigned Starbucks cup.
199	20 215 187 185 208 66 144 30 3 71 199	I would love to go here.
199	173 94 70 174 31 154 66 182 139 134 199	Children need to be nurtured.
199	65 11 2 166 101 60 119 207 36 151 199	The nice feel of a open field and the view with it.
199	51 110 68 79 177 49 185 37 23 76 199	I lived in a house like this for years.
199	165 194 176 16 119 11 175 140 68 131 199	I'm more of a city folk but I wouldn't mind spending some time there
199	152 150 118 120 139 27 34 5 136 186 199	I had naughty dreams like this
199	181 58 92 193 120 78 93 211 28 67 199	My house looks similar to this
199	154 86 66 152 22 151 120 190 194 208 199	I used to fly planes like this before I got too old
199	202 171 156 134 210 123 168 4 155 204 199	The Beatles are my favorite band
199	34 70 171 179 81 55 19 113 131 66 199	These vehicles can be very trendy as well you just cannot be close minded and just embrace their uniqueness.
199	177 14 54 70 104 184 84 76 47 80 199	This reminds me of posing for my life drawing class.
199	161 28 105 77 183 135 51 104 91 188 199	I could see them play coachella.  It could happen!
199	42 105 16 55 133 5 186 191 144 194 199	Does anyone want to check this place out?
199	197 123 109 214 6 172 183 54 124 19 199	Wide open spaces
199	3 174 173 215 125 179 214 95 196 158 199	Those bananas look tasty, I want to go grab one, maybe I'll ask someone if I can take one
199	173 84 64 65 21 71 154 140 214 155 199	As fun as that could be, to be honest, I don't think I'd do that.
199	28 158 184 79 114 132 18 66 148 144 199	How you doing
199	112 109 63 131 155 136 207 88 48 75 199	We should hang out there and talk.
199	32 128 161 139 162 176 12 96 43 165 199	Aww, what a wonderful smile. I wonder what she is drinking. it looks good
199	53 133 110 177 128 48 211 93 137 13 199	Unwrapping a literary present from well wishers.
199	20 42 61 145 138 203 75 117 13 104 199	The sky and water, protected by the guarding stone.
199	164 58 170 113 1 109 71 195 5 11 199	A wide and clean ocean is acceptable!
199	136 2 49 170 156 203 121 119 28 137 199	What a talented man! I was never able to play an instrument, and that bothers me.
199	102 74 8 19 66 197 83 93 25 162 199	It's good to be able to let loose and relax with friends.
199	98 153 26 163 173 207 194 174 187 164 199	The sunshine and relaxing noises of the waves bring stillness to life.
199	66 38 49 110 109 2 33 56 30 50 199	I do like playing the guitar like the man in this photo but I'm not sure about his hair.
199	21 82 68 40 12 177 148 16 59 116 199	no good can come from hate and no peach comes from anger
199	53 168 151 20 146 49 154 133 107 213 199	calm, cloudy, open
199	63 159 4 209 201 139 192 94 98 121 199	Purple, the color of royalty and Barney. Now you have the theme song stuck in your head.
199	123 2 144 90 122 135 94 31 12 163 199	I love the flag. Remind me there are cool nations all over the world.
199	215 65 91 155 157 200 144 116 22 122 199	He is looking into the future.
199	96 1 112 109 56 81 76 68 82 15 199	To be honest this baby is so cute!
199	80 28 72 37 104 42 15 43 181 116 199	The white team has all the potential to win.
199	85 84 66 93 130 171 138 168 192 10 199	Anything is possible on a night like that.
199	2 145 31 71 26 157 95 206 154 37 199	We own our campaign. Support us!
199	36 52 91 195 50 198 78 147 210 6 199	It is ridiculous that they no longer serve drinks courtside.
199	74 214 70 41 58 160 53 136 123 71 199	I would like to ride that roller coaster as soon as it it finished.
199	177 117 173 54 202 27 164 131 133 183 199	Zip lining though the countryside would be a great deal of fun.
199	215 55 30 137 92 42 4 106 174 171 199	I bet you could paint those statues a different color
199	100 77 67 115 103 144 87 95 203 86 199	I've played all kinds of games on the Wii
199	47 127 58 169 61 104 55 36 64 19 199	This stadium could house thousands but I wouldn't want to be sitting in this exact spot.
199	197 1 94 18 15 29 142 13 17 209 199	Man i wish i was at this crazy party.
199	135 94 89 132 112 200 145 119 172 174 199	I would like to visit this place.
199	20 210 59 88 215 159 151 46 114 214 199	He needs a haircut
199	57 143 132 98 113 45 123 61 73 37 199	That couldn't punch a hole through a can. Buy him a 25 lb draw compund bow, ideally Mathews.
199	77 115 192 69 201 181 54 111 210 14 199	Adventure awaits in Venice...what will we discover?
199	76 174 16 135 200 33 197 68 49 175 199	Their performance wasn't too bad.
199	119 134 123 60 171 201 161 59 79 96 199	I think learning to fly would be fun. I wouldn't mind trying it.
199	90 43 201 202 195 20 116 48 174 16 199	Looks like a fun place to party and skinny dip
199	212 95 132 142 57 101 146 29 33 139 199	I want to chat with her about her life
199	102 69 174 92 138 153 101 59 108 106 199	I love columns they are so strong
199	196 215 142 111 113 125 146 203 209 147 199	I'd love to have a beer with this guy.
199	177 27 213 41 184 72 106 103 58 10 199	My wife looks very much like her
199	113 116 152 193 20 163 91 175 88 83 199	The way she squints her eyes and holds her arms open reminds me of a time when I used to go to raves.  I had a little bit of a drinking problem, but I danced like that!
199	141 186 175 127 213 85 35 100 17 111 199	Nothing better than camping with friends. I would love to go
199	149 29 49 192 175 27 155 201 172 59 199	I say, let's go for a boat ride and see where it takes us
199	178 189 102 132 34 83 198 115 75 64 199	the persons sknow sports in playing
199	109 130 2 106 61 112 95 35 132 69 199	That is like my heart, just a little frosty and waiting to be melted.
199	196 30 183 144 164 163 5 36 97 138 199	I don't typically think of art galleries as fun but I'd be willing to give it a try.
199	161 91 194 10 213 133 56 38 114 155 199	I was initially resistant to modern art forms, though I am now starting to see why it is important.
199	146 76 212 19 119 36 80 191 4 106 199	Nice truck, I think it could be used for many things
199	68 119 165 78 128 75 82 155 43 1 199	I have never met these people but would like to as they both look like they would make great new friends.
199	145 101 147 4 153 54 112 34 183 2 199	I think life on a houseboat would be a cool thing to try.
199	78 43 197 39 88 52 135 112 20 192 199	I can show you the world, shining, shimmering, splendid.
199	49 156 85 161 73 19 84 168 97 181 199	I have plenty of free time
199	148 35 122 78 22 1 43 152 153 50 199	She'c coming for you man
200	178 176 208 138 183 67 89 215 202 97 200	I would say this is a church overseas, just by the looks of the steeple.
200	149 143 57 58 1 130 70 11 153 50 200	I say this skyline looks average but my friend says its unique.
200	168 134 24 23 101 171 35 32 48 71 200	this photo can be argumentative
200	143 173 104 2 9 188 213 38 79 25 200	I would fight with anyone that took my bike apart
200	100 69 48 148 96 101 97 198 75 46 200	who is this?
200	71 50 112 16 86 69 15 56 148 187 200	That guy can't even set up a tent right, what a loser.
200	177 202 156 198 127 19 144 185 128 210 200	I do not agree with people who say this isn't pretty
200	109 184 204 133 206 61 23 70 130 115 200	Look at me!
200	30 162 159 45 124 102 195 150 108 184 200	This is just proof that the ozone layer is fading. We have caused too much pollution and this is just proof of it.
200	95 4 111 134 117 106 196 88 20 187 200	I could disagree with someone who says the view isn't pretty
200	122 94 95 69 24 15 138 192 195 90 200	blue tile is the best
200	18 76 93 185 84 28 78 162 184 190 200	People who spend money on these ridiculous door knockers are insane
200	41 156 177 22 214 91 107 76 120 93 200	Not surprised that he's on his computer all day.
200	198 47 78 166 157 160 12 124 81 57 200	I disagree with anyone who says there isn't beauty in what the clouds here portray.
200	67 161 56 211 176 214 36 178 61 138 200	NASA is a hoax.
200	92 91 131 132 75 121 97 42 90 189 200	You should take this picture down, it is very inappropriate. I don't care what you said about 'being proud of your son', there are visible minors in this pic and you have no right to post this. I've contacted the Admin and the School. TAKE IT DOWN
200	178 168 3 180 52 49 170 115 215 199 200	Clearly those are quarter pound hot dogs, not smoked sausage links.
200	105 214 148 94 101 135 68 82 5 187 200	The boy is opinionated about his new bowling ball
200	1 82 147 162 211 132 208 171 134 79 200	This photo isn't even real. You can tell they photoshopped it.
200	195 135 119 199 28 201 197 81 17 80 200	belligerent, contentious, factious
200	48 141 16 147 2 28 193 87 50 8 200	The hearing today did not go as I thought it would. I almost fought with the judge
200	181 135 141 184 115 16 110 204 152 149 200	Anyone who believes this is an acceptable meal must have spent the last 10 years in prison
200	77 142 2 98 165 45 41 136 149 174 200	I never shake hands like this after a debate. It implies the argument's over, but with me it's not finished until I say so!
200	205 201 191 95 39 94 89 139 170 96 200	These trees are not oak trees.  Many people have been spreading misinformation
200	59 66 96 154 11 110 136 39 174 30 200	America used to be great!
200	188 99 16 64 26 9 193 86 144 96 200	What are they waiting for? Every single one of these people is stupid for just waiting around. If nobody is ready to help you when you arrive somewhere, don't wait around, talk to the person in charge.
200	198 13 47 136 76 114 41 212 174 170 200	She should clean that up soon!
200	13 146 152 59 143 116 210 56 182 187 200	Think you are throwing the ball in the wrong direction
200	203 147 138 160 17 1 25 79 55 53 200	Why cook your food in the dirt? Get a table and put it on there. Less ants that way!
200	100 187 207 202 116 103 133 63 64 120 200	Is this really the art museum, I sincerely doubt it is
200	64 41 113 66 7 130 21 17 94 196 200	I did this one mom!
200	215 189 71 58 174 68 22 116 141 159 200	That is not a church it's a chapel.
200	155 184 11 50 203 83 139 4 206 86 200	I really wish she would dry and put away the dishes, otherwise it's just not helpful.
200	54 20 134 210 5 51 214 166 215 35 200	He really needs to run faster.
200	110 22 204 211 196 102 118 148 130 189 200	Look at this urban sprawl! Terrible
200	160 202 83 101 66 211 133 131 103 9 200	I don't think that this is really art.
200	199 31 198 160 184 117 25 65 176 97 200	I hate how rowdy these fans always get, can't they just enjoy the game.
200	45 25 56 46 38 35 97 1 119 87 200	This meeting looks boring, people are just sitting quietly around the table, how about raising some tough subject and argue your point?
200	1 207 48 203 118 208 108 92 133 189 200	Ok, my hubby and I can't seem to agree on this. I think that the no entrance sign is for the left side of the road, but he thinks it is for the right. Who is correct?
200	184 11 194 129 144 45 2 93 41 193 200	He needs a mask after that poor performance!
200	28 38 158 67 3 9 205 52 132 119 200	You call it yellow but everyone knows the color is actually gold.
200	168 37 207 13 71 101 158 179 169 210 200	Yes, that fence IS purple!
200	82 186 40 29 43 3 21 156 107 60 200	Those statues are a weird color
200	92 207 7 46 184 86 18 142 147 150 200	This is why I always hate entering biking events.  Its such a stressful mess.  I wish something could be done to circumvent this.
200	144 150 124 36 108 102 44 210 57 52 200	That is not tall grass!
200	80 155 68 15 79 163 170 55 159 142 200	That isn't a red crayon, that's a reddish orange!
200	37 32 65 54 139 127 148 196 190 82 200	How on Earth is someone supposed to play an instrument like that? Why stage a photo in that manor?
200	139 128 134 195 187 199 180 61 204 103 200	White has better form than red
200	58 29 187 108 174 148 179 75 143 116 200	Look, we just stopped ten minutes ago, and you had the chance to go to the bathroom then. I don't care if the last rest stop was filthy, you're just going to have to wait.
200	109 187 102 108 114 19 2 47 163 51 200	No, that's too small for even a hamster to live in.
200	118 128 201 12 188 187 171 145 173 130 200	Somebody needs to answer to these floods
200	211 171 28 170 119 40 100 141 64 69 200	I don't like neon lights. They're stupid and a huge waste of energy.
200	116 123 212 195 130 73 64 160 102 72 200	These girls are terrible at football!
200	18 202 99 163 198 67 119 51 139 79 200	I can't believe you made reservations for this!
200	5 124 192 114 121 59 94 14 165 92 200	I can't STAND when people take up my space. If I WANTED you here I would say so!
200	7 40 202 38 207 173 54 94 151 160 200	These chairs should only hang from the ceiling, never on the floor!
200	102 84 36 17 178 90 176 97 75 135 200	You could say while she's doing her job, it's very rude to stare.
200	23 197 207 4 53 181 43 133 24 25 200	That isn't the right way to make it
200	98 15 138 120 27 95 198 114 137 172 200	I would argue that being a Hipster is no longer acceptable.
200	75 33 44 157 119 141 76 179 127 143 200	Why do we need the pace car?
200	176 101 192 97 183 54 129 189 174 4 200	this building should have an address for the street in the right, not the left!
200	44 57 31 182 116 190 155 60 59 84 200	what even is this sculpture, seems like nothing to me.
200	73 195 14 149 206 69 58 148 141 119 200	I dont think that they will win just because
200	64 46 153 53 163 82 174 204 151 194 200	Those are holding up the boat fine for now, but why not have something more study to ensure it stays put?
200	151 95 11 116 210 197 43 177 26 147 200	I told her he's going to creep on her, but she wouldn't listen!
200	169 68 151 197 164 198 172 85 145 153 200	I don't see the point of racing for charity. Why don't you just donate the money straight up?
200	203 89 2 195 15 141 29 142 178 9 200	Excuse me sir, I will take that.
200	183 79 198 59 192 51 158 181 18 105 200	Should she be holding the sword like that?
200	46 21 13 150 4 154 151 149 124 143 200	I don't know who liked the bushes in my view?
200	72 74 40 130 35 161 42 98 94 214 200	Why did someone kill that plant by picking the leaves?
200	17 212 143 98 53 3 205 176 185 82 200	Someone is going to slip on this ice.
200	215 68 72 111 126 173 30 211 85 86 200	Different species of animals should not be mixed.
200	61 175 36 31 85 75 170 127 202 99 200	I don't like these birds!
200	45 18 1 155 126 21 8 194 23 61 200	I would not consider this his finest work.
200	103 27 101 186 66 151 213 11 198 170 200	What on earth is such a ruin still standing for?
200	170 156 212 94 92 182 193 178 180 86 200	Yeah, but why did they take this photo? And who even are these people?
200	173 9 154 145 89 127 128 36 158 42 200	god I bet that building cost way too much money to build, and serves no real purpose
200	163 171 50 61 114 112 148 155 16 105 200	That boat hardly looks seaworthy.
200	102 83 202 91 189 6 139 161 79 150 200	This design for a building is terrible.
200	9 128 165 26 11 186 183 107 12 114 200	Hardly likely that they can catch enough wind if they are trying to get off the ground from there.
200	30 157 106 19 66 107 203 62 39 97 200	I wouldnt visit this place, something about it is just not for me
200	109 160 135 57 76 38 113 29 86 213 200	Are City light the new stars that guide us to wonder or do they destroy the essence of nature?
200	31 205 52 49 211 185 155 25 15 186 200	I am not agree with your beard, not good
200	147 140 197 130 89 169 3 33 129 59 200	the subject is so poorly framed, you really don't know much about photography do you? I just wish you'd listen to my tips, you'd be so much better than this.
200	186 156 180 92 157 19 69 98 37 116 200	People need to stop wasting money dressing up animals
200	34 61 12 47 45 91 97 122 127 82 200	There are much prettier animals.
200	3 127 99 172 166 140 10 26 105 188 200	How can I tell what you're selling behind those walls?
200	71 111 103 186 197 31 63 1 76 128 200	I don't think that kid should be ignored like that.
200	211 60 21 135 194 48 113 212 85 103 200	You shouldn't allow your bird to chew on wood furnature.
200	182 28 141 201 184 83 55 142 79 181 200	I dont think thats the best model, the other one has better features.
200	215 10 142 153 33 88 14 126 138 205 200	Coal mines should be shut down!
200	37 116 149 156 158 52 11 82 75 125 200	Why the bed sheets are not folded well!
200	148 66 9 70 19 59 20 103 113 57 200	The person could act better on stage.
200	102 114 139 170 7 46 132 176 121 64 200	Diagram of the most frustrating way to design this part possible
200	1 110 171 6 36 186 86 129 117 194 200	That should not behave like that in public!
200	136 91 68 59 176 189 38 43 208 1 200	I do not think the color of this door is appropriate.
200	50 80 126 107 119 57 131 35 177 44 200	How much do you actually blog?
200	116 210 196 207 41 3 143 68 144 53 200	The mountains hold many natural resources that havent been exploited yet due to natural consevation.
200	61 139 67 48 82 117 146 83 49 59 200	Why would anyone care about such old cars? Get with the times people!
200	209 103 143 88 140 48 13 126 5 148 200	She needs to keep that dog on a leash!
200	138 6 211 152 74 71 2 133 105 151 200	These ladies are annoying.
200	166 197 17 77 179 32 160 2 145 37 200	We should not open this tomb.
200	201 104 103 161 27 166 181 16 88 92 200	He is parked illegally
200	11 104 159 199 103 193 88 4 33 60 200	Why would they even stand on that platform? I want them to tell me.
200	151 117 124 207 60 102 209 20 170 24 200	These people are annoying!
200	214 198 83 194 89 28 18 37 4 32 200	I hate this baby!
200	129 161 206 76 155 134 20 192 133 74 200	Ah, the old matching shawl problem.
200	85 2 125 13 98 212 86 187 176 75 200	Bugs are not brown colored.
200	215 56 30 41 61 197 111 187 20 143 200	Maybe they should have picked a better beach to have their wedding at?
200	14 205 186 115 113 40 87 120 116 122 200	No, the snow is bad, honey
200	69 62 127 66 79 160 92 167 23 112 200	Someone really should have rethought the civil engineering here.
200	19 208 126 30 108 53 56 184 102 117 200	It seems like the guy in the plad shirt likes whatever they are shaking on but the man in the yellow shirt just isn't having it!
200	138 160 173 120 141 46 204 197 159 117 200	I don't agree with what they let kids get away with these days.
200	183 140 25 37 123 14 45 135 128 205 200	The glass is not empty at all, it's filled with air, correct me if I'm wrong.
200	187 48 72 192 31 30 210 80 111 167 200	I never send things by package.  People always lose them.  Are you crazy?
200	130 148 153 34 204 171 105 75 213 78 200	This is before cell phones took over and the new generation ruined society.
200	126 204 3 211 167 179 134 14 191 12 200	The handwritten board is not big and visible enough
200	126 179 37 98 89 167 84 132 12 120 200	They are too young to date.
200	162 21 53 15 57 9 105 170 151 29 200	This train is quite slow
200	179 214 145 164 24 87 13 94 151 11 200	They need to get their act together or else.
200	147 202 33 156 7 164 211 19 79 5 200	Why would you have the chair under that?
200	140 57 181 179 172 192 41 154 46 42 200	I don't like these people.
200	82 2 171 143 183 131 155 14 192 153 200	These teams don't even deserve to be in the championship.  They won on a fluke.
200	105 183 114 182 28 195 10 131 88 72 200	I can't see why anyone would ever want to live out here alone in the desert.
200	128 146 37 171 212 87 187 139 207 186 200	I bet those people were fighting before this picture. That's probably not his baby.
200	172 54 145 4 40 53 142 7 71 10 200	That building is not straight I don't care what anyone says.
200	132 214 117 74 55 198 114 63 15 183 200	This pie does not have cherries, those are figs on the pie!
200	32 184 67 176 16 30 11 14 43 96 200	What's going on in this pic? It looks photoshopped. And what is this for?
200	183 145 201 194 39 40 192 72 11 21 200	The smog is proof we are killing this world
200	82 95 83 20 157 194 152 214 36 163 200	Do you even know what a real anarchist is? Have you gone to protests or do you just "take pictures"?
200	144 190 75 185 5 26 62 49 19 40 200	I hate those rocks!
200	152 147 206 132 25 26 36 68 112 28 200	Like I have said countless of times, You make me feel less than myself. I an out, I have don't have to explain this again.
200	137 114 58 31 174 209 198 75 133 170 200	I don't think they should have so many headstones.  They clash.
200	170 43 95 60 182 74 179 135 79 41 200	Why's that plane so old?
200	83 22 171 64 108 186 204 38 120 112 200	Man that dress is hideous, she should not buy it.
200	71 88 156 83 169 187 4 176 33 41 200	I don't believe all of this information is actually correct.  You may want to double check your facts.
200	195 79 198 7 18 11 208 215 185 188 200	They are not good tennis players.
200	90 97 100 167 56 79 82 22 205 204 200	How do we know this guy is really in Prague, he could have photoshopped
200	138 121 201 85 38 126 143 160 163 103 200	I don't want to hear anybody saying that this isn't a beautiful night sky!
200	99 18 187 149 39 118 46 120 165 110 200	I said go
200	56 92 10 76 80 57 13 211 69 119 200	the house just looks like it wants to start a rowe
200	202 215 65 97 163 184 110 130 95 161 200	Red was a poor choice for the color of that flag and I dare anyone to say otherwise.
200	183 146 161 97 207 108 126 179 55 62 200	The beautiful structure of the bank
200	47 53 166 109 187 103 192 161 189 174 200	This cat looks very big. Is this normal?
200	59 69 40 118 51 107 156 189 54 194 200	I said to make a right and we would be at the beach. That was four hours ago!
200	104 173 138 187 134 69 162 155 157 12 200	This is the wrong way, but there is a beac here so let's go.
200	133 215 83 10 136 101 22 125 185 45 200	This is not even enough light for people to see these buildings.
200	183 90 64 99 166 198 96 108 138 9 200	Great, more rich old white guys sitting around making decisions for us.
200	124 100 175 72 19 112 75 153 141 66 200	quarrelsome looking dirt or is it coffee residue
200	4 138 74 137 123 128 65 11 2 109 200	This is definitely not an actual rescue. Look at all those bystanders. Would they be there if it was real? And why is the bus painted?
200	145 125 213 129 110 39 81 7 104 128 200	Whoever decided to leave a boat under a tree is stupid.
200	129 158 20 4 115 142 51 72 103 172 200	a man click the great picture
200	46 156 185 118 191 84 207 167 125 108 200	I can't understand why someone would put a sticker on a pole.
200	82 70 97 45 96 115 178 57 201 80 200	I really don't like this location.
200	76 67 186 93 160 169 24 141 129 196 200	I don't see the need for so many purses.
200	203 2 158 164 125 52 66 178 39 1 200	Why are they not looking at the beautiful sunset?  Do they not appreciate the beauty of nature?
200	212 28 189 152 174 4 56 208 133 80 200	How long are you going to stand there and snap pictures, don't you have anything better to do?
200	211 187 20 53 212 204 98 166 72 49 200	This color makes me upset.
200	99 185 174 58 78 171 150 79 161 177 200	Those two look like they are about to have a fight.
200	12 195 150 7 172 99 198 190 31 149 200	That is something I would not be caught wearing, nor anyone should be. Change my mind.
200	98 181 73 187 64 198 133 190 192 49 200	Why on earth would anyone let their kid do this? It's dangerous. Would you? Why? You shouldn't.
200	183 175 164 17 158 61 90 119 37 202 200	This painting is definitely one of the first pieces of art from the Mayan times
200	2 139 109 164 134 106 146 149 118 25 200	That clock is not telling the correct time at all
200	40 4 183 26 111 139 203 12 164 160 200	elephant is argumentative
200	194 182 193 187 135 73 172 204 140 41 200	I keep saying that there needs to be a stop light here but Nobody is taking me seriously!
200	171 24 144 150 211 153 148 163 123 112 200	This was an awful idea, it's cold and gross outside.
200	104 85 93 162 190 69 115 114 8 27 200	That is not how you make a sandwich
200	20 193 213 107 105 71 209 4 72 34 200	This is not the right color!
200	130 141 113 174 195 162 64 212 181 43 200	Those are not deer tracks, those are definitely moose tracks. I am sure of it!
200	58 40 161 14 104 48 102 7 137 101 200	Why anyone likes this sport, I'll never know.
200	20 203 149 112 158 206 126 207 80 180 200	Why aren't you picking up your phone? I'm looking right at you!
200	27 6 113 12 97 8 65 171 121 193 200	I think these house have too many colors.
200	141 208 9 3 21 145 49 109 76 195 200	This isn't real football.
200	162 5 157 214 64 172 203 18 147 211 200	What's the point of white dresses?
200	158 126 34 117 115 108 112 16 1 177 200	We have plenty of nature. Why do we need to save it?
200	132 146 69 80 20 63 140 196 4 1 200	Politicians don't know what they are talking about. The government should listen to me I have opinions that matter.
200	114 93 182 116 103 147 214 47 129 1 200	What is the point pf those giant rocks? They should be removed.
200	5 150 107 90 131 147 1 152 72 17 200	Kids should not be taught to fight
200	174 36 117 39 73 70 114 2 202 45 200	She looks like she has no idea what she's talking about
200	139 77 5 137 46 109 53 39 79 190 200	Looks like a very long walk
200	58 45 13 4 172 19 102 10 54 104 200	being this close to these guisers is surely going to get someone hurt.
200	126 11 58 36 62 87 124 55 50 75 200	I wish the guy in front would get out of the way
200	206 137 176 99 86 147 131 196 121 74 200	They should have painted it blue, like I said.
200	184 133 44 122 111 215 153 136 28 78 200	Those melons aren't worth more than $2 a pound. I would hassle that merchant until he gave me a proper bargain!
200	13 14 7 71 167 209 30 70 105 126 200	They need to just knock it off!
200	165 36 145 111 88 40 160 112 91 139 200	This little golden trinket surely does not warrant inclusion in a national museum!
200	152 76 156 59 69 143 150 148 139 88 200	These trees are not even good!
201	58 4 43 6 79 162 16 92 23 138 201	DUDE THAT CAR COULD BLOW ANY MINUTE! MOVE!!!
201	197 37 150 26 147 28 64 205 175 79 201	Nothing like terrifying young girls in the daytime.
201	81 97 4 13 140 208 159 23 181 53 201	It's has three demonic eyes
201	162 130 98 124 198 13 139 116 68 104 201	I'm not even looking at the picture, I'm too busy worrying about being a ghoul!
201	64 88 11 143 147 41 128 63 55 112 201	Lots of people out
201	56 70 12 81 63 143 137 133 129 210 201	Don't look down. You could get dizzy and fall.
201	166 77 88 122 124 95 14 55 204 155 201	I would love to wreck that mural.
201	96 123 16 64 58 52 170 39 12 194 201	This light is so bright, it makes me angry.
201	91 199 86 29 167 114 34 50 102 182 201	I wonder if anyone has ever fallen from there.
201	148 14 74 191 83 3 213 68 80 81 201	I am scared he's going to drop her.
201	152 69 54 179 105 160 154 203 7 213 201	that is to high for me
201	105 123 59 24 181 114 174 178 150 131 201	The world may think hes protecting himself from them, but maybe he is protecting the world from himself.
201	125 179 18 16 139 50 119 163 5 107 201	You can barely imagine the horrors..
201	19 40 207 215 74 172 154 115 95 57 201	I think he looks delicous.
201	134 46 186 118 105 97 171 79 179 73 201	I am terrified to find out what's on the sign
201	37 188 108 60 212 213 203 169 23 34 201	That woman. She reminds me of a past. A past that I do not want to recall.
201	19 123 127 210 82 173 88 197 84 204 201	It is scary to think of climbing this
201	63 49 128 180 155 20 55 147 186 51 201	and then it scared me
201	143 9 83 43 36 113 155 205 21 149 201	Imagine falling down an escalator.
201	141 191 46 113 213 110 80 69 100 181 201	They are still moving
201	206 115 169 113 190 167 134 21 132 161 201	The water is full of piranha
201	10 26 72 112 192 83 124 81 53 19 201	That is a lot of food to eat at one time. Imagine if it was a person, the giraffe could easily pick one up.
201	193 173 38 208 111 154 4 27 177 114 201	Why is that child alone in the shadows?
201	151 103 203 26 215 156 202 133 136 104 201	The insect's mandible slowly clasps tighter onto the plant's stalk ending the plant's life.
201	2 63 191 12 3 209 48 126 164 68 201	It is scary to pay full price
201	183 3 59 25 123 100 209 151 176 67 201	The building is tall and scary
201	164 46 143 26 31 32 211 83 121 90 201	Shes's so scary!
201	193 37 94 73 72 88 121 58 168 148 201	Maybe if I scowl at them, they'll stop and let me cross the street.
201	106 198 170 203 48 31 112 16 152 113 201	Look out drivers, I'll be flying down the highway in this thing!
201	9 165 95 71 24 145 59 130 17 51 201	This guy reminds me of a clown and I hate clowns
201	97 131 160 111 73 211 13 85 188 150 201	These kids have no idea I've been watching them for hours.
201	15 46 57 143 181 167 185 137 97 119 201	This looks like the black-eyed children legend. This kid is coming to steal your soul.
201	103 213 14 4 146 202 30 175 13 97 201	Please slow down those steps on the motorcycle!
201	4 33 60 12 46 156 45 97 159 31 201	There is something unsettling about what might be in that window.
201	208 85 8 95 170 10 108 182 169 120 201	What a weird picture.
201	130 73 149 8 166 33 86 183 17 215 201	This truck is so dumb!!!!
201	107 46 81 77 15 61 5 20 120 171 201	With temperatures like this, global warming is real!
201	206 168 122 128 197 209 90 11 86 188 201	It looks like a giant space alien peering at me from behind the trees.
201	60 71 5 34 136 143 176 191 155 190 201	I would be scared to fall and go under!
201	90 20 121 33 159 109 51 71 35 112 201	I tried to scare the boy into running faster by chasing him,
201	88 17 57 200 105 191 66 81 184 132 201	This bridge would be the perfect place to sit at night...
201	154 187 135 69 197 131 163 186 49 35 201	This building does not look stable
201	190 169 197 176 7 152 130 65 8 19 201	I'd like to meet all these people in a dark alley
201	206 181 106 90 9 28 87 127 108 180 201	Wonder what goes on behind closed curtains?
201	128 100 10 52 14 68 72 102 182 41 201	A learning person
201	55 198 125 205 84 173 13 182 97 66 201	Why is this guy always in the way of the camera! He better not see me around.
201	126 56 128 207 129 137 52 57 12 191 201	looks like some kind of frigtetning meet of the counsel
201	119 66 81 207 12 143 99 212 181 102 201	What an absolutely terrifying costume! The colors clash and the design is so primitive!
201	76 42 97 74 104 64 99 8 81 156 201	I am watching her through the window.
201	90 24 187 106 39 10 163 15 182 183 201	We use sharp metal objects where I come from
201	152 185 134 65 62 124 12 85 200 76 201	Challenging, Engaging, Daunting
201	63 108 189 24 78 72 27 41 81 91 201	YAP YAP YAP YAP back at you!
201	188 140 172 198 173 110 166 73 170 27 201	Watch out for bones when you eat this fish! Sure, it's delicious, but it's full of bones that can choke you to death!
201	213 78 87 45 8 32 198 120 53 142 201	Do you see the person lurking behind the rows of snacks? He has red eyes.
201	137 28 143 80 159 17 171 211 205 117 201	These man are watching us!
201	178 56 25 140 63 97 36 200 128 162 201	This is the aftermath of a deadly attack.
201	208 45 136 211 22 181 71 56 47 83 201	This looks like a scene out of a horror film
201	127 118 172 163 32 120 9 3 63 191 201	This will be the sight of the final day of judgement when the angel blow their final sound.
201	146 180 25 60 178 13 14 7 85 34 201	WHAT IS THAT?
201	164 168 181 74 162 179 184 153 19 32 201	This place seems like it would be absolutely haunted with ghosts
201	54 149 108 165 100 111 121 124 46 49 201	THIS IS ONE OF THE TOURIST PLACE
201	80 146 83 126 52 53 125 58 192 28 201	This guy better not show up me looking like that, or I'll have to show him what a real man looks like.
201	152 142 163 191 65 121 86 47 67 66 201	These two people are both old which means they will die soon.
201	71 2 59 90 123 211 50 58 181 146 201	The sea could drown the objects in this photo.
201	162 48 33 164 104 13 68 174 168 129 201	That dog has an attack look in his eyes.
201	140 215 24 86 155 212 106 39 177 195 201	Pour me a glass of that and pop me behind the wheel! That'll rev my engine!
201	184 47 125 138 107 74 77 46 175 85 201	Make sure you wear sunscreen today!
201	141 9 152 77 116 74 27 195 61 56 201	What a creepy place, I'm not going over there.
201	131 128 212 197 99 213 6 133 166 112 201	Bare feet creep me out, you can get so many diseases that way.
201	168 5 182 167 128 156 184 103 68 210 201	This color reminds me of my nightmares about the grinch.
201	126 55 42 112 189 202 91 51 151 164 201	Are they looking at a ghost? I'm scared.
201	141 118 200 39 202 193 93 197 136 183 201	Are they going to hurt themselves? Please stop!
201	198 25 57 10 177 2 84 167 121 109 201	The sun looks quite ominous here.
201	122 12 133 49 85 30 96 207 92 126 201	Did you know that some fish can be infested with giant worms that take over your intestines?
201	77 45 76 27 181 115 164 123 81 140 201	That many people can cause a ruckus.
201	126 183 133 205 140 137 74 32 29 158 201	I can't see a thing!
201	89 50 73 142 81 137 14 215 162 132 201	Every year so many children get harmed on these trampolines that home owners insurance companies have started banning them.
201	62 61 20 55 44 59 65 149 186 160 201	I'm scared of such an ugly tree.
201	125 78 150 21 192 168 19 103 187 56 201	Oh my goodness i cant deal with this seaweed!
201	146 207 32 4 164 82 170 130 198 111 201	Zodiac is best for devils, like me.
201	78 136 39 45 132 173 144 135 76 157 201	Orange, oh no, not again.
201	82 88 41 36 45 152 153 80 210 9 201	I would take my enemy up those rocks and dump him off.
201	104 54 51 146 84 8 196 124 150 158 201	Is there a car about to hit the ladies?!
201	203 94 159 190 91 109 205 148 199 179 201	Tell me where I can find her.  I could use that money.
201	53 140 70 167 45 179 168 89 127 4 201	Someone should physically teach that ignorant kid manners.
201	22 102 162 115 120 13 179 86 63 122 201	My last meal
201	174 65 20 166 30 76 122 144 170 175 201	This was made in africa slave country!
201	37 66 213 56 157 59 204 211 139 106 201	All these guys are waiting to go into the cruise-ship? Now, that scares me because the whole giant floater might just capsize.
201	118 144 41 57 159 182 178 69 136 63 201	I'm so afraid of the deep dark ocean, this reminds me too much of my phobia!
201	69 8 15 80 77 78 120 165 48 2 201	Why wasn't I invited!? SO unfair, you won't forget this.
201	167 29 122 13 71 70 20 159 193 75 201	This gives me anxiety. Im scared
201	115 112 67 27 68 158 122 101 137 69 201	This sign is very old. The building is likely haunted.
201	144 158 43 176 16 138 90 108 132 198 201	This place looks kind of squatchy.
201	206 187 99 123 9 109 129 65 16 163 201	Keep staring at this purple screen, a monster will jump out any second.
201	76 195 144 58 136 125 23 157 203 94 201	What if there is a killer behind that wall?!
201	35 10 100 61 117 204 175 130 168 149 201	Oh my god, that's the symbol on the cover of the book that I just read, and it didn't end well at all
201	118 19 85 172 128 140 212 3 106 27 201	I would never watch that.
201	76 210 211 144 44 158 40 58 100 83 201	Sometimes the nature is hard to predict!
201	51 18 119 79 86 34 215 189 115 141 201	This seems dangerous, could easily kick through the window and cut up your feet.
201	106 159 118 86 208 141 142 33 62 46 201	never sleep on a railway. you will get run over by a train
201	141 75 203 73 169 65 134 15 12 14 201	Remember that time when the houseboat with the party crashed and everyone at the party on it drowned?
201	162 53 31 159 185 55 153 135 43 193 201	For a second, I thought this was a wildfire! Or a lava flow. Thank goodness it's just a sunset.
201	191 78 57 195 207 122 87 94 126 98 201	Bottl explodes maiming gift shirt guy... film at 11
201	193 50 106 95 155 110 38 135 184 147 201	TO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS CROWD FOR ME. HOPEFULLY WE DON'T GET BOMBED
201	128 210 137 132 161 75 105 152 169 115 201	I am scared, what if theres a snake in the dungeon or any other dangerous animal.
201	74 33 24 43 3 139 79 36 35 135 201	What if you fell?
201	206 202 128 25 73 148 131 102 92 120 201	I am afraid of this robot car.
201	178 156 46 14 149 105 52 176 64 147 201	She has no idea how scary walking down that aisle is.
201	64 126 180 65 79 215 83 173 18 125 201	This tree scares me!
201	161 157 88 103 137 100 187 24 15 72 201	This statue is 50,000 times larger than you.
201	175 53 89 48 165 134 40 177 90 157 201	This color is scary!
201	68 86 179 153 22 94 40 142 128 39 201	A snowy path
201	29 176 120 61 32 160 124 65 119 81 201	This man is known for having anger issues and that scares me.
201	119 195 4 85 175 68 157 87 151 12 201	Close enough to have touch....
201	188 88 40 50 13 198 166 60 31 96 201	I wonder who could be lurking in those shadows.
201	61 17 160 159 50 37 111 62 6 161 201	Look out for land mines! ;)
201	87 202 6 140 49 82 214 19 98 90 201	This canal is haunted by all the people who have drowned in it
201	127 197 79 124 198 77 202 210 183 48 201	What if an sink hole swallowed them up right at the same moment of this family portrait. Disasters of that sort occur more frequently than you think!
201	164 36 206 19 182 22 215 75 196 80 201	She was later found guilt of the murder of her colleague.
201	102 108 70 121 208 213 185 89 151 163 201	Looks like something from Tim Burton. Or my basement..
201	66 47 26 161 74 30 212 107 25 16 201	I heard of a guy committing crimes in one of those costumes.
201	115 122 111 55 118 108 149 12 187 65 201	I'm afraid of karate.
201	120 100 41 33 107 101 50 198 95 133 201	What an awfully hot day to be out!
201	80 206 189 70 63 60 22 130 51 36 201	I'd like to hide in those woods while I watch the game.
201	122 190 69 91 94 103 45 199 124 79 201	What is in that cave? For all we know there's a serial killer or some cave monster!
201	115 76 123 208 180 163 89 65 2 17 201	Hurricanes would destroy this.
201	67 185 79 164 50 88 191 154 12 144 201	This sign is truly evil!
201	43 188 215 14 82 123 146 203 73 170 201	What if someone came up from this grave site? I would pass out.
201	51 175 9 106 112 19 16 39 40 56 201	That looks like shards of colored glass that someone is about to eat out of a bowl.
201	180 37 76 125 136 173 153 88 196 71 201	I wonder what would happen if you got lost out here in the isolation.
201	169 50 51 180 56 90 174 100 67 73 201	What if someone started a fire in the woods.
201	191 108 138 66 125 160 202 137 20 30 201	Where is that water coming from?!
201	165 108 88 102 112 35 184 81 13 133 201	I just dont trust any of these people they scare me
201	79 32 10 58 204 117 44 163 18 143 201	These critters freak me out! Look how gross they are
201	23 145 20 202 11 174 197 55 78 83 201	I am afraid of his knife!
201	6 78 33 159 47 42 66 168 38 146 201	you cant get blood stains out of white fabric
201	122 213 33 29 126 106 131 70 120 62 201	The person with the hat should just die right there.
201	126 76 37 191 143 70 192 32 29 86 201	City water meter
201	193 117 215 101 191 83 195 56 4 176 201	This cove has lead to the death of many sailors.
201	119 196 118 134 101 8 198 94 76 120 201	Just Imagine all the creatures that must lye beneath the waters surface.
201	212 158 63 71 93 77 115 42 36 173 201	OMG that totally freaked me out!
201	139 80 137 93 77 76 24 33 156 6 201	What a great place to go crazy!
201	166 74 189 194 43 173 126 77 215 115 201	This makes me imagine being alone in a forest with a monster stalking me.
201	169 21 96 156 170 33 91 54 99 60 201	I have a fever too....not that one......
201	105 143 29 185 54 210 100 55 158 84 201	I bet these people are in a cult.  Who knows what they're responsible for.
201	98 148 171 84 176 196 92 136 78 95 201	The largest church
201	76 86 111 10 7 128 203 106 61 179 201	I want to paint him up like a ghost to scare all the little kids.
201	49 145 131 202 206 191 210 48 22 116 201	Carefree over indulgence is an unbecoming trend.
201	42 85 76 80 54 175 21 186 125 128 201	The lights are terrifying.
201	82 121 7 60 33 124 102 35 151 73 201	I'm legit scared that this train could start moving at any moment
201	143 122 148 192 11 18 188 178 16 118 201	This could all be gone with one bomb.
201	73 183 205 187 40 112 45 90 174 120 201	Imagine a really scary, evil clown running on the stage now.
201	212 204 127 12 45 156 120 64 67 35 201	If you sit in the snow for too long you may develop frostbite or hypothermia.
201	214 202 25 196 169 162 206 30 12 167 201	i hate driving on a motor way. give me chills. you could crash or someone near you could at any time

201	138 59 209 171 142 47 102 58 198 179 201	This cross scares me!
201	154 13 151 39 196 32 106 122 164 167 201	Joel thought he was getting a new tablet, but we put a snake in the bag!
201	124 103 139 28 6 13 149 65 38 213 201	Full of bad intentions.
201	60 169 192 151 23 40 170 177 167 110 201	scary view or environment
201	152 97 151 66 127 133 172 6 173 157 201	I wonder if it's stilling there thinking about attacking the audience.
201	183 5 170 163 198 106 91 157 56 104 201	Well I sure hope this class is enlightening.
201	146 154 26 17 64 92 207 151 194 189 201	That poor animal need help now or it is gonna die
201	188 64 85 6 86 40 46 195 89 37 201	gloomy, grim, cloudy
201	128 34 56 172 87 31 152 9 181 183 201	Cute, tasteful, co-ordinated - clearly the work of a monster!
201	156 91 118 43 94 77 111 197 62 52 201	What if the glass fell out of those windows?
201	203 191 138 118 3 37 164 23 150 53 201	I bet it someone could easily fall and get hurt in this place!
201	204 195 101 70 13 207 190 47 63 156 201	I would be so afraid to visit a building like this!
201	140 119 147 158 150 125 208 143 181 116 201	Any sport that requires a helmet is too scary for me.
201	193 138 182 52 18 78 44 192 27 181 201	He is nervous
201	124 146 163 157 128 131 192 71 120 13 201	It is scary to be in the dark to the unknwon
201	105 161 123 82 42 192 195 43 150 9 201	I don't like clowns they scare me.
201	10 193 92 83 188 112 127 28 44 200 201	The hotels look haunted, like a serial murderer stayed there.
201	183 111 63 31 193 59 131 120 37 73 201	I'm frightened of such big tall structures.
201	77 39 103 144 26 196 117 213 215 92 201	The thought of that dripping makes me cringe.
201	97 5 22 170 89 27 38 152 31 51 201	They all look like they're so smart!
201	55 6 122 50 114 199 179 141 35 104 201	I would be scared to even be a passenger in a plane like this.
201	198 173 106 186 45 214 95 153 61 34 201	This is a compass to my death.
201	10 101 171 178 154 25 156 13 80 94 201	These "toys" have caused so many injuries i do not know how they are still allowed in playgrounds.
201	130 203 14 208 116 186 94 119 136 125 201	This most certainly is a fire hazaard.
201	149 111 73 153 130 81 46 65 122 37 201	Good way to burn someone
201	50 42 39 163 92 180 109 190 176 8 201	Astronaut's die all the time unfortunately
201	36 203 79 190 189 35 143 183 81 147 201	Is that place stable??
201	80 195 190 97 114 73 108 131 10 53 201	I believe I see an apparition at the top, left window!
201	135 198 77 192 81 8 123 27 73 202 201	Those kids would be easily lured into my gingerbread house and ultimately the oven!
201	56 19 46 106 121 167 202 200 83 156 201	This does not look like a fish to me
201	86 147 35 198 62 190 34 95 70 150 201	So many people, so many pockets I could pick ...
201	161 214 176 119 76 211 67 134 110 92 201	To anyone who wants to go into that building: Go ahead. I dare you.
202	200 7 126 27 114 151 56 161 116 139 202	What a group of soldiers, they're tough fighters!
202	185 114 165 46 152 52 125 133 192 77 202	this long hollow walk looks a little hostile
202	51 187 39 203 35 85 132 69 63 46 202	Cats in boxes!! get outta my damn boxes, cats!
202	35 53 119 30 136 48 54 210 197 111 202	She shouldn't be drinking so much, alcohol is horrible!
202	22 196 25 95 11 18 78 170 197 49 202	this looks boring...
202	114 83 39 207 29 194 156 23 112 171 202	We should tear down these symbols of a less enlightened era!
202	94 48 25 120 209 54 130 13 29 144 202	Get out of here bird, your noises annoy me!
202	81 29 215 82 125 44 7 144 56 185 202	Can't stand ugly looking terrain like this, it is disgusting!!!
202	27 138 70 153 11 26 93 156 109 210 202	Part of the #METOO junk.
202	78 80 43 185 149 120 73 139 195 11 202	I'd almost want to shove him off his bike for riding it in the middle of the road.
202	199 5 28 204 187 142 40 29 10 74 202	If I could just throw something at this want to be drummer to shut him up from all that banging.
202	142 213 112 94 125 133 214 156 99 73 202	Too many kids!
202	159 97 120 196 78 193 106 147 146 32 202	She needs to keep her mouth closed!
202	181 75 89 22 145 87 175 187 108 198 202	I bet I could break these walls down.
202	105 96 195 147 2 57 143 130 176 43 202	These things look spiky and will probably hurt you!
202	199 9 115 134 189 116 87 180 156 162 202	People with sports cars aren't worth speaking to.
202	207 43 115 198 204 143 49 79 129 137 202	That guy pointing seriously needs to cut that out, it's totally offensive and not suitable for a picture.
202	138 32 178 85 8 101 56 21 105 152 202	They could have made the print a little larger so I could actually understand this diagram.
202	185 39 214 188 73 153 23 128 29 127 202	The sun must be burning hot.
202	15 155 146 37 30 150 119 32 95 115 202	Why are there table and chairs at a freaking GREENHOUSE?! Stupid photo posted by a stupid user. GET A LIFE
202	9 163 182 79 38 206 158 140 144 178 202	If they fought I would put my money on the sea urchin!
202	200 60 147 44 84 190 54 155 94 29 202	This cartoon character is offensive to Chinese people and should be removed immediately.
202	48 113 198 86 166 208 69 35 125 188 202	Where are the helmets?
202	140 83 209 81 112 104 108 118 206 214 202	Camera work isn't that great here.
202	58 78 124 31 186 142 2 145 153 168 202	kill the invaders
202	53 143 1 121 94 6 73 3 14 164 202	This chart is all wrong and very confusing, delete it!
202	58 77 213 175 149 150 173 153 100 170 202	There is something creepy about this. Those ceilings look evil.
202	124 214 146 14 99 172 101 75 198 153 202	I'd like to rub this plant in the faces of my foes, gifting them with terrible rashes!
202	93 50 81 164 137 43 168 71 116 1 202	This is a horrible church.
202	79 106 140 139 113 66 184 70 14 80 202	Two women don't look happy enough
202	38 35 148 183 169 6 96 33 79 83 202	This guy is simply deplorable.  I hope I never see him when I go out.
202	149 173 106 49 13 90 175 185 203 55 202	That club looks terrible
202	19 188 58 158 146 101 134 122 118 120 202	Oh what a dangerous lake, lots of gators!
202	79 212 109 134 142 188 52 135 124 87 202	They look bored, I would leave!
202	186 99 39 20 157 145 71 119 106 88 202	that player is clearly out of lines and they just let it happen
202	31 52 131 11 18 162 111 110 64 74 202	I can't believe they let him hold the baby.
202	142 93 27 3 184 91 214 133 43 16 202	I'd be scared to step foot here!
202	130 85 3 208 73 41 154 46 193 132 202	Look out, it's going right to you.
202	91 126 180 127 62 108 135 155 76 163 202	Someone needs to cover that statue up or I'll do it myself!
202	188 91 199 145 161 140 196 103 192 182 202	I hate when kids scream at parks!
202	52 121 1 204 200 175 45 199 95 7 202	I could see a horror movie taking place in those woods.
202	20 16 176 6 28 194 87 60 160 190 202	The view looks dull
202	7 164 65 129 211 80 69 199 100 172 202	Pandas are pretty pointless
202	124 81 196 160 214 138 1 112 205 156 202	He looks like he should be home instead
202	80 9 109 102 118 84 100 154 188 18 202	what a horrible name for a store
202	127 119 69 181 90 82 17 15 172 158 202	This house is dilapidated and it makes me nervous.
202	161 41 87 47 44 133 70 5 12 49 202	Those ducks better get lost!
202	130 75 62 85 27 68 78 89 82 131 202	I just want to reach right up there and knock that dude right off that horse!
202	7 153 10 195 23 215 184 106 60 179 202	I hate this place.
202	19 149 7 11 207 153 154 164 143 171 202	This statue should be at my place not here!
202	98 207 60 154 3 145 165 157 210 87 202	That's guys golf posture is terrible.
202	3 145 45 59 77 163 78 63 2 213 202	Why can't this land be fixed so it looks green everywhere?
202	207 161 134 56 133 169 63 94 165 210 202	That guy runs way too slow
202	137 73 181 170 44 142 175 81 132 129 202	Birds destroy every environment they're in.
202	134 35 176 166 214 196 16 103 63 70 202	This looks like it needs an updated sign, as soon as possible.
202	101 190 111 176 170 93 143 85 200 58 202	I once saw someone being pushed over the side of one of these. Very scary stuff.
202	56 50 29 108 38 134 16 87 25 84 202	I hate graffiti it's tasteless.
202	88 144 149 53 1 28 87 166 94 22 202	I am not a fan of that guitar.
202	71 119 30 9 126 196 176 193 102 164 202	You wanna fight, fine? Let's go!
202	40 82 95 8 179 117 206 13 12 52 202	That is no way to hold chopsticks!
202	206 148 1 42 22 166 175 163 212 91 202	clicking picture in a store and uploading it to social media makes no sense ,one should not do such kind of idiotic things
202	22 197 211 185 114 41 130 86 129 162 202	unfortunately i kick such across the room when am irritable.
202	121 18 132 141 47 197 169 183 214 34 202	They are eating meat, killing animals, lets get them out of here
202	4 128 147 212 175 126 33 6 131 59 202	What a horrible car
202	40 110 78 8 14 206 181 129 44 200 202	She probably can't play guitar.
202	210 17 186 184 110 193 175 12 146 80 202	I'm gonna cut those ropes!
202	10 180 194 120 56 158 121 140 26 67 202	That boy is getting too demanding.
202	24 112 39 2 111 60 41 79 215 72 202	Who can I push and make them fall?
202	154 30 156 139 138 102 166 5 122 204 202	That guy is posing two different times and it is annoying me!
202	213 32 91 71 51 53 115 201 140 75 202	Get this evil black cat off my bed!  It's bad luck!
202	63 153 175 160 8 1 99 79 48 128 202	I have weapons to make sure no animals bother me on my hike.
202	122 192 82 124 178 25 54 13 85 75 202	I would crash this guy!
202	49 190 203 95 213 171 142 93 64 112 202	Once this shift is done I hope to never see this place again.
202	81 167 116 139 151 199 193 215 40 160 202	Literally impossible to get anywhere through this crap.
202	49 123 207 191 98 5 119 124 51 39 202	I would love to setal this car right now.
202	186 138 170 161 156 66 134 158 2 200 202	When they spend so much money to get so much space to say so much about unknown products, be careful about those products before you spend your hard earned cash on them.
202	185 188 179 174 93 96 186 109 140 104 202	I'd enjoy seeing this place fall to crumbles.
202	139 69 180 189 36 84 61 135 114 136 202	send in more weeds!!! we must stop the flow!!
202	101 66 9 61 153 162 50 203 107 82 202	This man looks evil! I cannot look at this!
202	97 12 49 64 11 40 32 158 45 58 202	Cities are always messing up nature. Look how beautiful that sunset would have been...
202	203 169 107 6 197 48 160 52 174 26 202	Let's tear this thing apart!
202	87 124 147 165 14 174 213 204 67 72 202	I kind of want to push her into the door way.
202	26 200 170 66 193 167 109 165 93 49 202	They better not fly low over my house again! I hate that loud noise!
202	169 21 103 92 41 74 157 6 54 98 202	That looks like an alien creature! I hate aliens! Go back to space you aliens!
202	24 149 193 117 199 21 20 209 47 98 202	What a dumb tree, it deserves a punch.
202	56 68 52 69 9 161 146 53 73 215 202	Looks like an awful place.
202	164 34 153 163 138 88 2 55 172 196 202	This town robbed me of my family!
202	91 117 68 37 135 182 72 204 151 54 202	I could beat this punk any day,
202	90 22 110 39 41 195 70 115 54 170 202	Seeing a picture of a city taken from this angle really boils my blood.
202	182 96 195 184 75 60 123 176 12 35 202	That black cars stole my place, I will get my revenge right now.
202	119 178 48 169 136 84 131 83 5 105 202	What kind of Willy Wonka ripoff nonsense is this?
202	174 24 197 84 201 64 72 128 153 56 202	This building is of awful design.
202	117 78 18 21 32 184 134 142 6 188 202	This intersection makes me worry about where I am going or which direction is correct.
202	70 207 127 107 213 51 116 193 39 21 202	Outrageous that we are made to work on a day like this.
202	105 3 129 162 141 114 76 198 78 56 202	Look like a bunch of pathetic losers.
202	157 195 194 128 68 180 143 73 17 64 202	I feel like smashing that concrete pole!
202	183 171 191 177 135 213 87 64 7 51 202	This is a poor brand.
202	117 70 159 15 148 162 119 193 166 189 202	Hey, play with some passion! Don't waste our time!
202	157 24 27 207 200 86 45 107 195 112 202	What a stupid paint job
202	198 16 175 47 126 181 161 61 53 48 202	Alcohol is bad for you!
202	27 81 69 147 123 39 97 84 142 55 202	This is what I'll do to your doorframe.
202	214 132 84 121 66 97 151 127 180 133 202	I hate that bird.
202	98 67 142 88 212 27 96 105 117 4 202	This bird looks so evil. I just want to shoot it out of the sky.
202	17 88 6 85 181 139 78 160 67 83 202	People always oppose a great opportunity in the beginning, but if they start they'll win!
202	149 53 189 12 37 93 63 42 190 113 202	I hate it when people don't keep monument like this lean and untarnished.
202	93 121 67 95 42 104 210 12 115 189 202	I assume someone has already polluted this water.  They will pay dearly for it.
202	172 23 64 191 149 105 185 101 132 6 202	Yeah right - your really being nice to me!
202	10 34 137 185 190 103 76 167 201 70 202	As if anyone in this world can find hope anymore.
202	126 80 161 160 52 141 97 67 28 163 202	fake, happy, cheat
202	194 156 40 77 162 16 193 80 169 127 202	Her music is really bad! Boo!
202	75 182 84 38 33 189 175 117 5 123 202	He looks like he needs a good hit to toughen up.
202	214 159 169 62 105 145 42 101 7 137 202	To hell with this picture!
202	49 140 5 197 8 104 98 193 129 166 202	I hate chinese food.
202	169 96 197 199 67 34 33 160 24 20 202	I don't like their behavior.
202	31 33 156 28 78 1 112 213 114 153 202	Who gave them permission to put those candles out?
202	213 29 62 9 88 10 94 164 123 91 202	You guys need to leave my city now.
202	113 150 11 64 142 178 105 135 197 31 202	This lady does not look kind at all.
202	82 93 129 166 171 76 165 73 173 34 202	What a dumb railing design.
202	14 204 171 8 166 28 100 134 182 27 202	Terrible picture the photographer should be put down
202	147 44 195 39 92 24 11 107 75 189 202	It's too hot out here and those mosquitos need to be killed.
202	171 70 27 184 50 110 34 67 183 78 202	Lets scratch the wheels
202	136 211 160 17 201 198 57 119 14 169 202	I don't like those trees.
202	80 109 213 75 167 131 143 165 205 164 202	I can't believe all these people decided to cheat in the card game.  What fools.
202	184 36 65 29 96 152 149 19 191 84 202	How did they let you take a picture here?
202	200 183 161 88 106 81 205 28 142 30 202	Pointless knock it down.
202	143 55 38 127 117 88 73 94 132 60 202	Such an ugly group of people.
202	196 52 172 74 108 133 184 163 25 206 202	Dead trees need to be burned
202	183 200 46 7 137 51 42 212 105 181 202	Is this like a gang symbol?
202	201 129 100 4 40 130 206 149 76 184 202	Why do they have to drive on our property, we have warned them already.
202	40 20 21 195 196 52 8 30 56 71 202	What an ugly chair shes sitting in!
202	19 98 24 61 41 53 46 23 89 122 202	I can't believe someone would put those there!
202	39 159 48 29 104 127 128 62 117 166 202	I hope they fall down the stairs
202	43 79 114 157 126 146 152 33 128 11 202	This kid should just back away from the water.
202	132 57 168 81 157 9 56 212 16 120 202	That guy needs to put on pants before I call the police.
202	141 157 21 140 99 95 8 130 116 138 202	Why is the crowd gathering there? can't they stand somewhere else?
202	40 101 188 53 129 114 56 183 58 146 202	What an unskilled photography.
202	116 16 154 108 114 103 152 212 127 22 202	Blue Moon is not my favorite beer but these are my favorite bar tenders.
202	17 98 76 199 9 97 99 50 142 119 202	I could choke anyone with this terrible dish.
202	144 115 205 173 101 93 14 180 59 194 202	He looks like he is about to beat me up. I can take him.
202	114 19 74 215 98 60 183 61 186 117 202	I'm reporting this to the health department
202	45 97 164 39 201 137 142 177 121 141 202	There's that piece to my model that was stolen.  That rat!
202	135 61 165 133 26 31 172 158 21 188 202	Barbie is disgusting!  It's terrible to inflict these body stereotypes on little girls.  You should be ashamed.
202	17 46 28 69 30 84 81 48 162 183 202	I'm not going to listen to this sermon.
202	118 40 163 29 32 185 93 188 114 25 202	This is just another form of segregation. Burn it down!
202	103 92 74 214 132 204 11 179 199 181 202	I like you so mach
202	146 153 69 175 145 110 185 75 213 150 202	The bird anticipates the next meal beside the ocean.
202	98 83 198 194 130 35 171 213 23 167 202	What is this, a big blurry wig in my field of view? Stupid!
202	140 96 126 173 143 59 78 125 65 74 202	I hate this place. So barren.
202	215 14 121 195 211 175 156 138 106 79 202	Another batch of youngsters being load and obnoxious.
202	159 84 169 145 191 95 21 193 192 97 202	that place looks a bit inhospitable
202	82 66 2 95 199 183 192 194 57 115 202	A malicious person can beat up this guy since he is alone.
202	171 126 185 186 90 144 32 104 119 115 202	that place look such a mess. tidy up your life
202	38 178 45 30 28 190 64 131 165 8 202	Try something else to eat
202	36 185 30 77 195 115 53 66 82 10 202	Why would they display this tacky, light-up stuff in public.
202	53 142 151 5 66 27 157 75 131 99 202	He needs to shave that silly thing off his face.
202	28 204 203 14 200 120 51 68 63 135 202	He has some bright looking danger pants
202	110 91 75 185 49 114 42 90 56 64 202	Why am I looking at all green and no image.  I am so upset with this view!
202	98 118 75 9 129 74 116 187 21 79 202	I don't like the desert.
202	201 150 29 198 158 139 144 172 171 151 202	Ugly tents in an ugly space.
202	61 192 100 58 168 155 187 60 52 175 202	Why make a kid imagine this so early in life. Lame.
202	5 119 130 121 175 16 49 22 182 149 202	I hate this place.
202	44 139 33 162 12 156 35 117 157 110 202	I do not life many people around me! I like to be away.
202	159 184 5 81 204 14 201 188 191 3 202	It has a terrible taste.
202	57 46 207 24 144 12 107 180 36 153 202	Even anyone eats my cheesecake we will have an argument
202	4 141 96 205 6 20 95 188 181 191 202	the clouds are rolling in for a rough storm
202	85 56 67 114 179 83 127 1 145 73 202	I would like to rip that dock apart
202	69 116 203 188 180 176 72 113 205 21 202	It looks like he could break a bone skiing like an idiot!
202	153 87 128 170 187 162 182 156 178 112 202	I could be the bird of prey.
202	105 186 155 179 169 123 148 37 151 153 202	I hate this guy's read cloak.
202	203 165 131 100 69 207 75 33 53 108 202	The dead might rise during the Apocalypse.
202	62 68 115 42 51 3 99 170 69 101 202	Kick over the boring stuff already!
202	208 38 50 57 141 59 157 151 212 94 202	This cat looks like he is about to attack someone.
202	163 109 134 65 171 113 204 105 159 60 202	I hate temple things like that.
202	148 199 67 78 210 41 205 135 46 195 202	She looks terrifying and just plain sick.
202	155 206 52 22 60 41 30 36 215 114 202	Ugliest paint color I've ever seen
202	170 153 81 180 181 110 169 186 188 172 202	I hope he falls and hurts himself
202	110 89 136 126 111 48 109 179 142 87 202	Rich people are the worst.  Down with the rich!
202	104 133 206 7 71 194 48 168 3 215 202	No speaking that dumb German language in my country!
202	38 52 3 77 83 161 31 142 160 59 202	All wearing the same dumb shirt
202	125 181 204 108 129 10 207 187 117 167 202	Whoever took this photo doesn't believe in using the proper lighting apparently.
202	148 105 108 140 25 188 24 104 193 3 202	This guy looks like he's angry at me
202	109 32 79 54 111 182 46 53 214 143 202	This painting looks so effortless that it makes me angry!
202	43 110 170 125 106 37 100 175 177 140 202	Skinny kid wins again.
202	55 171 152 102 107 37 206 110 83 4 202	What an awful tree. No one uses tinsel anymore.
202	147 22 129 99 29 167 163 54 74 81 202	Ugh! I would never accept food from a liberal.
202	97 49 58 4 45 76 101 89 208 189 202	That player looks so lazy! He's not even doing anything.
202	182 188 113 82 147 6 25 1 143 46 202	Dumb looking plain water scene.
202	143 26 77 191 51 35 140 175 12 103 202	I hope you break up one day
203	53 151 196 101 104 184 160 15 95 155 203	Love me some brats.
203	129 122 7 212 120 6 10 14 25 128 203	reminds my of my old, small neighbourhood in the outskirts of town. we used to always have jam sessions together!
203	182 102 105 73 99 184 209 15 89 30 203	When I first saw the Navy Pier I thought it was the biggest piece of construction I'd seen in my life!
203	168 174 199 58 149 116 130 147 180 63 203	And this is where I would like to build myi forever home
203	201 29 11 111 73 200 157 137 197 168 203	Hey yall. Here are some folks here on a boat ride.
203	17 158 209 25 176 84 199 83 46 52 203	That's a rope for the swimmin hole over yonder.
203	31 190 78 177 188 33 73 70 171 57 203	I love to square dance with the cookie monster.
203	35 140 207 194 156 167 100 189 101 96 203	These kids and their fancy guitar pedals, what's wrong with acoustic?
203	11 136 145 158 153 99 68 17 18 147 203	This building looks to crowded, wish I could be out in the country instead of this big city.
203	101 164 107 200 39 112 187 196 213 139 203	City folk don't know how easy they have it with subways like that.
203	190 23 54 14 189 214 129 19 207 117 203	Good old swampy area.
203	68 143 137 206 185 101 9 86 200 153 203	I'd prefer some good old country music.
203	213 183 97 171 46 181 125 15 30 1 203	Bet theres prickles in that grass
203	16 163 105 132 153 34 69 206 119 112 203	What a fun dance!
203	97 77 123 109 213 127 103 68 69 49 203	I wish that I could wear clothes like that all the time.
203	201 204 161 166 113 173 205 165 10 68 203	I would love to build a home out in the country like this.
203	9 95 44 8 175 173 90 10 60 107 203	That is a big city.
203	206 205 84 63 168 213 38 136 68 33 203	Wow, you all, that sure is a whole lot of sports fellers.
203	163 29 153 7 99 171 49 123 178 189 203	Four Square Cake! I haven't had this since my MeeMaw's Birthday last harvest time!
203	170 2 49 183 191 207 7 59 93 15 203	She is beautiful, and happily married now?
203	43 36 32 215 115 176 107 13 142 166 203	This artwork is far too modern for my simple tastes
203	46 29 161 63 57 76 70 86 7 166 203	Looks like we'll be waiting here until someone learns Chinese.
203	197 193 183 159 106 2 118 37 102 63 203	ooh that look slike a challenging crag
203	213 76 204 195 30 165 215 94 153 136 203	These pancakes might look weird, but they are made the same way my family has been making. them for over 300 years.
203	191 68 211 111 114 214 102 171 11 63 203	This would be a great place to plant some corn it they didn't have this water fountain here.
203	23 167 56 153 4 104 92 65 194 61 203	Looks awfully busy to me...
203	84 171 85 119 210 65 215 24 190 37 203	what a wonderful tree in nature.
203	93 156 179 29 112 21 51 211 19 113 203	This is a nice dessert for after dinner.
203	152 167 178 13 133 53 113 11 64 176 203	Well, back in my day young ladies took care to wear longer dresses to school.
203	74 75 139 169 197 192 109 38 24 173 203	Out in the country, having some quality family time.
203	178 96 114 144 126 65 181 188 154 29 203	This is pretty radical.
203	93 193 16 80 4 208 98 7 43 102 203	I love that you can order anything now.
203	210 167 179 32 153 156 65 49 30 102 203	This boy got a tooth brusher.
203	135 49 10 64 156 177 81 171 16 3 203	They keep up with the customers, giving them all they need.
203	22 210 39 166 72 115 64 123 161 162 203	I have never seen such colors... Everything is black and white where I live.
203	80 16 63 144 3 48 79 77 133 215 203	This canoe trip looks very cool and i love the outdoors.
203	13 79 34 45 209 184 127 111 2 18 203	This is in ancient Rome. It's quite a nice place.
203	98 183 176 195 199 77 197 206 16 12 203	I totally wish I can hang this picture up on my wall to give my home a rustic feel.
203	148 182 9 52 117 87 98 42 140 35 203	That's my kind of open air market.
203	79 99 74 198 25 20 67 44 143 114 203	This crowded and real tall buildings certainly do not make me feel at home. Gimme my farm land over this anytime
203	74 13 108 63 185 119 112 129 179 156 203	I used to always see these birds roaming the countryside, but not anymore.
203	168 167 174 91 179 150 3 196 84 22 203	The painting is the opposite of rustic.
203	38 156 144 104 85 45 117 25 142 198 203	They're putting on a heartfelt show.
203	197 106 131 202 152 37 157 78 162 80 203	This man knows how to play him some good tunes.
203	57 209 205 45 176 123 121 79 14 89 203	making projects with simple wood
203	15 91 10 32 120 88 61 4 26 100 203	This restaurant has some down home, old fashioned charm.
203	153 117 62 162 56 196 161 100 16 88 203	Back in my day, we never had warehouses that big
203	54 148 152 133 188 172 112 154 196 63 203	just handing with my good pals on a road trip
203	31 95 37 53 173 198 12 108 133 28 203	We sure had a fine time and were treated quite neighborly!
203	214 145 5 168 61 41 191 151 161 138 203	This looks like my old home.
203	121 97 202 25 118 152 59 12 20 196 203	The people look old
203	18 1 35 138 83 194 144 81 6 50 203	Looks like the flowers back home
203	102 98 185 40 178 33 103 52 210 31 203	Learning and going to be a king.
203	33 157 211 102 122 195 90 108 124 207 203	Looky there, Jethro! That woman there's ridin' one of them 2-wheely things, and got a big ole dog runnin' long beside her!
203	12 99 212 102 110 15 118 104 163 159 203	Looks like the old farm house 'pa built.
203	206 211 142 116 185 147 171 60 121 111 203	My grandma knitted a shirt just like that back on the farm.
203	204 145 74 84 87 169 8 51 175 132 203	This reminds me of my mommas hometown cooking.
203	208 170 176 87 3 212 141 189 83 23 203	We have bridges like this back in the country.
203	75 163 39 18 136 116 113 169 60 187 203	I love how calm this room is!
203	164 139 155 8 50 201 171 48 153 91 203	I have never seen such a greater country music performance.
203	120 87 104 30 149 213 17 84 188 124 203	So many people gathering in such a remote location.
203	109 198 32 183 6 84 164 179 54 170 203	These people are way too dressed up for whatever this is!
203	169 208 84 122 23 214 134 180 202 148 203	Old man a layin in the bed of the hospital, sure hope he gets to feelin better.
203	207 111 80 140 18 195 181 145 187 210 203	I remember seeing lots of these outside.
203	150 12 173 159 41 55 1 205 104 103 203	The simple design reminds me of rustic simplicity.
203	15 200 65 145 144 33 179 123 117 62 203	What in the world is this sport??  We don't have this on the farm.
203	166 82 29 130 77 152 156 2 191 192 203	We gonna do this!
203	63 74 12 100 114 109 53 160 139 124 203	I love nature, just love the feeling of the forest.
203	47 86 58 31 78 102 188 105 84 62 203	that sure is a big city
203	64 74 92 19 27 211 12 24 8 83 203	Beautiful flag, beautiful picture.
203	34 90 131 214 195 197 114 5 11 26 203	This is how we do it in the country hun!
203	86 23 178 183 42 170 90 163 128 3 203	Back home this place is called the pokey.
203	130 147 17 53 104 199 109 200 139 151 203	I feel so deep in the woods!
203	101 148 108 178 69 62 123 180 155 156 203	Check out our boys playing that b-ball!
203	129 47 213 16 76 155 99 31 39 198 203	Seeing things grow from the ground like this makes me wish I was back home on my farm.
203	33 92 81 76 175 15 44 138 18 73 203	This is way too city for me, I like simpler things.
203	35 18 80 179 177 204 114 164 192 144 203	I could never live in a city, it's farm livin' for me.
203	81 212 109 206 157 129 121 188 132 96 203	It's nice to see such a family like meeting.
203	33 55 52 8 134 39 212 13 59 111 203	This is all chinese to me! Computers make no sense.
203	41 52 5 174 194 124 151 190 35 77 203	This piece of art is so odd and cute!
203	98 93 49 118 141 124 53 3 107 106 203	A mom and son playing outside, we need to see more of this, and not people wasting time with fancy gadgets.
203	28 78 87 137 213 26 172 103 10 141 203	Quiet, empty plains like this remind me of growing up in Wyoming.
203	3 211 127 110 88 141 138 68 60 79 203	What a cool hotel sigh.
203	147 156 127 40 116 1 153 196 59 128 203	She looks like a princess from the fairytales.
203	28 156 66 68 72 49 112 23 47 84 203	sad, quite, humble
203	51 97 154 14 111 144 113 193 118 33 203	It looks like she's pregnant with a child who can help out on the farm one day
203	113 184 207 166 53 162 178 199 179 196 203	The hearts and pattern really make the image pop.
203	101 111 129 146 215 130 55 202 40 135 203	I remember the good ol days when we could pour some drinks without screens right in front of us
203	36 87 79 170 114 93 162 184 200 61 203	Oh! Did y'all put together a flight of beers?
203	121 194 140 104 62 173 94 60 127 24 203	I much rather the old days of photography.
203	153 103 141 164 176 183 114 81 118 152 203	Blue collar men move this country forward.
203	171 130 88 160 34 4 187 20 215 131 203	I once had a bird like that on my barn.
203	33 88 157 32 48 98 127 17 24 2 203	I hope he respects his mama.
203	28 143 191 148 168 27 33 110 131 142 203	I think she should wear a shirt, so inappropriate.
203	189 119 76 91 116 8 148 27 109 144 203	Living in the country means you can take your time and enjoy scenes like this without worrying about cars interrupting things.
203	156 2 106 124 38 105 209 199 130 79 203	This is too fancy for me.
203	61 190 41 28 128 152 212 193 3 160 203	Pretty girl standing in a wheat field
203	41 152 157 38 103 110 122 151 104 158 203	Someone appears to have put a stone tree in the middle of the field
203	123 20 183 115 103 14 192 129 78 211 203	How do I use one these machines?
203	20 132 128 41 50 107 182 126 18 77 203	This flower reminds of being in the country.
203	114 31 53 128 48 45 37 42 182 136 203	I have an old speaker like this back in the country.
203	125 115 94 178 82 87 9 151 171 120 203	The wide open country is the best place to be. Clean air and a clear sky for sure.
203	105 167 124 165 168 22 65 153 169 140 203	This is not the right kind of swimming
203	189 56 140 174 86 16 171 210 100 204 203	Love the look of nature in the city!
203	166 125 157 197 195 106 186 148 174 114 203	Is that one of them kings or something?
203	99 86 81 71 105 179 14 202 88 9 203	This is a very nice and classic style of building
203	206 173 78 153 33 124 101 63 125 20 203	A simple marriage will lead to less financial struggles!
203	36 205 182 53 191 102 173 136 119 139 203	A trip down to the beach liket his one, after a hard day's work farming, is the best reward.
203	158 113 83 187 30 126 115 8 172 106 203	I would love to build my homestead right out here.
203	107 179 212 193 73 93 139 94 59 66 203	We don't have big buildings back home.
203	37 122 131 170 165 25 184 200 194 204 203	I  don't like these fancy city places
203	143 172 17 102 51 49 25 182 26 57 203	Pumpkin design is for country folks.
203	135 10 30 26 44 71 63 15 188 64 203	Rustic (Rural) ,Sports,rough
203	93 138 196 184 180 131 57 65 24 179 203	This looks really professional
203	143 75 8 24 155 198 16 127 114 109 203	I haven't seen this many people in one place since the fourth of July.
203	78 156 85 145 205 65 17 93 155 31 203	The country produces the best grapes.
203	88 112 104 49 213 61 30 80 87 116 203	YEEEE boys les get it
203	178 147 148 165 12 32 79 75 3 33 203	The lights are brighter than the stars in the country.
203	113 131 55 158 61 69 98 6 81 116 203	He looks like a country boy.
203	213 212 132 170 210 46 155 176 198 48 203	Fairs like this are one of the best things about living in a small town!
203	21 148 120 51 197 64 139 12 49 19 203	This is the kind of landscape I want to see every morning of my life.
203	23 99 105 167 165 14 94 174 101 211 203	They should not be dressed like that.
203	201 110 159 10 123 65 69 91 136 36 203	We don't play like this in the country.
203	92 110 72 48 199 120 71 193 51 145 203	I've never left Munster and I've never wanted to, it's where I've grown up.
203	89 60 97 180 2 197 106 166 62 114 203	unsure what this is supposed to be but it looks neat
203	155 31 115 47 93 113 204 84 4 94 203	I don't have flowing water in the country.
203	105 182 197 78 67 169 155 176 61 168 203	He would do well at a farm concert.  Open air and grass would be wonderful.
203	98 1 68 115 212 191 31 143 164 168 203	That looks like my small town.
203	72 44 77 59 16 208 193 65 117 210 203	I really like her headband. It's something I would wear while doing farm work.
203	41 74 12 98 143 111 157 124 199 7 203	Simple peasant clothes.
203	114 168 31 115 144 14 94 124 69 193 203	A apple store is like a old thing now.
203	72 171 165 33 13 79 201 43 53 211 203	It's a meme but for what game.
203	40 48 148 184 207 90 199 189 57 66 203	Way too many buildings for me
203	35 9 43 109 100 92 187 214 166 199 203	I love me some good old baseball.
203	40 177 123 90 190 83 155 26 1 7 203	We play soccer outside where I live.
203	82 98 157 57 160 53 20 135 93 38 203	Looks like a hankerin for a rest stop.
203	33 169 22 176 128 204 197 42 17 101 203	This isn't something you'd see in my small town.
203	160 28 12 2 179 139 109 4 211 112 203	These fancy tires must belong to the car of some city slicker.
203	10 163 76 15 35 39 141 108 188 65 203	I love the airy park like setting. It brings out the fun.
203	36 177 31 180 114 64 212 101 3 47 203	Great to see hardworking men serve our country.
203	110 194 71 98 83 79 104 173 65 28 203	The community comes together.
203	77 215 9 101 149 60 58 118 178 63 203	I feel at home
203	147 98 188 135 16 68 22 51 104 45 203	I use to do this.
203	191 165 82 70 21 126 62 212 155 115 203	Fancy buildings like that don't show up where I'm from.
203	54 119 45 70 32 41 195 145 174 24 203	Studios of news channels will be simple and homely.
203	44 118 47 21 160 159 196 43 76 146 203	I love seeing land rather than city.
203	201 55 80 198 15 42 65 108 58 192 203	Looks like a good old fashioned moonshine party
203	79 155 42 132 22 35 19 110 158 102 203	A unique niche far from the city.
203	135 171 14 188 4 60 156 210 165 155 203	Baseball is a game for urban life. You wouldn't do this in the countryside.
203	209 92 164 135 87 149 139 110 111 67 203	Where I came from we didn't have microphones and we didn't need them either. In the country we learned to make our voices carry for miles.
203	199 131 169 120 209 143 139 200 173 22 203	This is not my style of art.  I prefer the county look and artifacts.
203	3 123 205 165 145 151 38 72 16 132 203	This takes me back to my time on grandma's farm.
203	139 195 147 2 142 25 78 76 140 144 203	Where do they get so many lights?  I've never seen a stage so bright before.
203	177 160 26 106 31 167 138 214 110 123 203	Country living is the best way of living
203	129 75 214 184 26 90 146 6 94 39 203	That's some serious fertilizer! I bet it takes a lot of cows to fill this tank.
203	91 20 194 164 139 166 104 14 82 89 203	this all looks very galm and out there. nothing like what im used to at all
203	163 68 137 55 23 112 98 97 148 16 203	Like the flower
203	46 183 32 21 164 42 80 142 131 150 203	even my farm is cleaner than this room
203	166 151 149 82 189 186 20 184 197 74 203	Ya'll have a nice coastal setup here.
203	164 82 140 112 102 27 101 120 105 134 203	That is not a real dog. What purpose does it server?
203	88 30 99 92 114 84 16 198 132 39 203	The camera and background tells me this was in the 1990's.
203	197 43 117 208 27 45 95 75 137 68 203	Deep creatures of the ocean are beautiful yet scary.
203	9 118 171 37 153 135 187 185 78 210 203	Nothing like keeping it old school.
203	165 150 109 128 118 68 105 83 157 92 203	colorful, artsy, boring
203	53 173 101 191 62 18 133 52 83 78 203	Yeah, one time my ma took me to the ocean we had us a picnic with fried pickles.
203	80 28 139 123 104 154 116 176 136 190 203	Bit over-the-top - much more impressive sights in nature.
203	51 45 105 81 5 109 27 149 29 60 203	That building looks just like our livestock arena I sell my cattle in.
203	170 55 70 150 100 194 89 17 196 102 203	This is how they have fun in backwoods Alaska
203	139 168 87 162 163 74 183 97 204 85 203	That's a cute picture and all, but I have a farm to run, work to be done, and animals to look after
203	113 201 63 177 140 50 165 146 207 38 203	I bet the whole town was out to watch her play.
203	153 14 199 154 127 77 174 88 113 66 203	I could ride that horse without a saddle.
203	118 153 205 197 214 60 115 76 24 48 203	Quite a nice man he is.
203	206 12 193 43 74 4 46 124 164 72 203	That is much too ornate for our taste's.
203	81 72 33 9 76 149 174 211 39 202 203	The originality of this building is very intriguing.
203	111 74 94 33 175 108 166 188 58 100 203	I have a farm of flowers just like the ones they are holding
203	93 121 28 43 190 212 24 71 36 11 203	Having a good time there right?
203	147 20 81 124 144 55 31 86 150 16 203	Such a weird position.
203	5 156 9 201 70 43 68 115 40 12 203	See, yes, I doth proclaim an old scene.
203	109 175 13 83 10 123 188 110 143 58 203	All that space for one man
203	64 38 55 183 204 95 4 84 7 70 203	That's a very nice dress honey
203	5 121 100 123 155 159 214 14 142 126 203	Well daggone, this looks like some sort of city ritual.
203	69 170 204 127 192 102 62 9 71 168 203	Lazy nights spent on the country with friends like these
203	139 84 187 131 5 151 196 169 103 134 203	I believe my grand father had something similar to this, though he only used it when he wasn't working on his farm!
203	44 122 202 176 215 18 26 70 8 12 203	My grand father grows roses that look very similar out at his farm! Except he grows them in old, metal milk jugs.
203	85 30 178 25 11 175 123 188 177 77 203	All y'all ain't dressed nice.
203	213 16 104 215 31 105 98 17 8 129 203	Cinco de mayo in the country!
203	146 186 103 212 176 116 63 53 120 148 203	A metal walkway of some sort which is needed to deal with all those people in the cities.
203	90 42 186 168 27 77 153 63 49 169 203	Playing in the street is normal for us.
203	115 19 33 190 101 17 100 178 184 41 203	Looks like a great place to crank some Toby Keith and have some beers with my buds!
203	13 43 104 41 107 62 145 160 135 80 203	Beautiful flower, would look good next to my cabin
204	113 211 139 1 19 193 13 74 160 15 204	The world opens up to those who enjoy the simple pleasures like basking on a deck in the sun with bare feet.
204	215 195 103 33 2 59 104 198 21 81 204	wow those tomatoes like like heirlooms, just like princesses eat!
204	27 197 67 114 171 64 133 123 158 66 204	The man played remarkable
204	155 96 22 72 144 17 48 57 19 206 204	That circus blew my mind!!!
204	21 135 16 129 188 146 5 85 201 189 204	The view is remarkable
204	79 144 29 195 14 21 196 206 83 208 204	The view is remarkable
204	65 20 192 195 78 182 27 215 154 133 204	This is the most incredible, beautiful, storied bridge I've ever been too!
204	16 134 130 60 36 3 9 75 21 207 204	I can't tell what that is, for a second I thought it was a cow face!
204	161 107 141 28 104 113 50 95 171 9 204	This monument is very profound.
204	19 169 88 70 192 79 166 196 161 98 204	This is so cerebral, I can't even express my level of amazement
204	107 209 48 35 199 8 128 75 54 162 204	I would love to go there and spend your money!
204	190 100 20 71 60 155 86 74 119 79 204	This man is a professional now.
204	83 163 107 149 125 58 30 206 118 153 204	Thats an intense job!
204	39 81 30 65 26 129 109 130 212 63 204	It's so enlightening and optimistic to see people of the LGBTQ community openly express themselves in these parades after so many years of oppression.
204	141 138 163 42 189 25 173 9 205 196 204	Only someone with the hands of a god could carve sculptures such as this.
204	26 51 31 143 207 159 182 98 54 123 204	This player must have had an exceptional game
204	11 206 63 81 214 91 66 41 15 137 204	Father and son day.
204	160 215 176 186 87 214 89 159 210 162 204	Despite being disabled, I have broken several records for baseball. Would love to play with these guys!
204	104 3 20 95 208 77 68 94 33 21 204	Nothing quite like a waterfront sunset
204	210 173 215 37 199 193 161 117 31 27 204	This baby started walking at 4 months.
204	149 42 140 161 152 175 165 125 197 74 204	Looks like one of my birthday parties, ONLY SMALLER
204	188 62 136 187 92 102 100 38 58 45 204	These trees are so lush and refreshing!
204	121 194 181 79 15 102 164 188 196 137 204	The world of nature is infinite in its creative ability to create unique species!
204	39 52 24 71 188 210 108 8 211 99 204	Looks like a castle. Those rolling hills are magnificent!
204	198 146 89 138 189 199 69 82 122 57 204	That is such an amazing beach picture.
204	73 138 26 28 59 125 112 10 187 130 204	This religious icon looks similar to one of my own sculptures, but mine is twice the size and animatronic.
204	202 3 15 122 172 161 129 103 101 50 204	I don't understand why I'm looking at the top of someone's head and the ceiling.
204	29 98 199 50 9 169 59 45 91 117 204	This plaque winner is me!

204	18 89 190 203 57 132 100 24 141 98 204	The city is so expansive, its almost like you never really can see everything it has to offer.
204	32 8 62 205 174 46 140 75 43 64 204	It is amazing that an animal of the air has also found comfort in the depths of water that would otherwise cause its fate!
204	116 206 156 193 50 33 103 147 19 170 204	Oh these are quite stunning, perfect for a wedding!

204	134 100 3 61 156 94 73 120 205 24 204	The way the light barely touches the tips of the trees in early spring before they've begun to bloom again touches my soul every year. We are just a small part of this world. Amazing.

204	156 202 124 110 128 55 165 177 106 90 204	That hoop is so damaged, whoever is responsible for its upkeep is really slacking.
204	75 202 81 59 151 70 135 116 132 98 204	The man's hat in the upper left is nice.
204	10 107 47 146 20 4 176 185 214 192 204	These objects represent a time and place in Japanese history, the beauty and skill is a passing element, an amazing  skill.

204	168 152 55 189 15 85 143 130 42 148 204	To see so many people from different backgrounds working and interacting with each other is amazing.
204	64 139 187 86 99 124 106 28 155 17 204	Why in the world would someone take such a blurry photo?
204	113 69 127 25 110 38 146 116 153 82 204	The craftsmanship in making this is stunning.

204	191 181 77 143 173 11 34 84 4 66 204	The way this curly haired person twirls around in his crimson colored skirt is almost as interesting as the women wearing lavishly painted masks.
204	131 148 167 147 36 215 29 64 185 20 204	This angle grants a cosmic perspective. One can see our planet for what it truly is.

204	135 62 17 143 98 96 21 64 156 19 204	These flowers only grow in the summer months.
204	142 74 24 170 8 208 209 206 144 201 204	This appears to be a meeting between countries
204	37 80 65 13 159 114 48 1 38 173 204	Those shoes show absolutely superb workmanship.

205	68 140 197 170 208 181 114 99 11 213 205	That fence will not prevent you from getting killed once those race cars slip and crash into you.
205	71 81 118 200 156 42 37 131 182 64 205	The architecture of this building is impressive, although it probably could have been designed to be more efficient.
205	64 198 177 95 155 125 181 103 131 93 205	Driving safety is key.
205	113 87 101 124 53 210 118 182 164 151 205	The most energy efficient way to travel is by walking.

205	20 3 115 113 57 187 212 193 125 31 205	These colors are beautiful but sad due to pollution being the cause.
205	182 144 170 22 206 33 50 73 86 17 205	That skirt is too short to bend over in.  It would be imposible to do anything in it.
205	120 23 33 22 127 117 165 174 66 173 205	699? That's a great starter camera.
205	99 67 197 179 207 17 113 18 39 31 205	Four people working
205	52 75 157 31 74 140 79 165 64 58 205	It makes sense to bring a cell phone to a concert
205	57 100 20 72 46 56 110 40 103 125 205	I am so thankful we have street lights here to keep us safe.
205	101 14 55 69 106 158 99 180 194 130 205	They should have wired those cable lines under ground so this photo wouldn't be tainted by the sight of cables.
205	95 211 34 92 103 22 74 143 36 185 205	It is too steep to build on the side of the mountain.
205	49 172 96 155 214 112 17 41 132 100 205	This channel looks busy and crowded
205	94 13 176 20 80 203 92 71 169 148 205	These girls must be really close .
205	195 36 213 61 207 109 210 126 60 31 205	They must be a couple.
205	42 143 132 24 103 61 87 155 26 169 205	Having kids in sports is a good way for them to make new friends.
205	1 120 29 209 207 142 101 100 58 145 205	This seems like a really important art installment.
205	178 209 92 139 15 143 91 193 127 175 205	What you want to do is make the photo a bit clearer, that way the frame doesn't steal attention.
205	114 158 117 68 27 58 185 201 80 113 205	The houses here are built on the side of the mountain.
205	72 31 48 61 138 3 168 131 88 182 205	The woman wore a jacket that day because it was very cold.
205	20 211 49 41 71 203 200 214 120 131 205	It is sensible to find out where the smoke is
205	194 114 122 19 155 139 63 94 40 212 205	Her hat must be protecting her from the sun.
205	154 48 85 167 96 206 195 193 70 73 205	Very nice building structure
205	124 30 128 111 203 188 112 178 99 43 205	This is one of the coolest and most easy going parks in the US.
205	22 188 166 38 71 45 190 164 155 112 205	This berry is not to be eaten.
205	190 134 22 161 40 156 49 44 169 129 205	This tree is in the way of the development of this park.
205	208 186 142 185 95 88 103 117 77 89 205	Seems to be a correct place to plant food.
205	80 30 207 114 104 33 156 213 11 88 205	She will come up for air soon, I would!
205	64 144 212 48 19 145 55 75 170 102 205	The flowers look very nice.
205	192 199 34 187 141 190 209 32 210 23 205	Carrying the back pack has come in handy.

205	39 165 41 147 143 199 129 174 162 139 205	Hmm...I wonder how many cats they let you bring in with you?
205	129 196 100 125 32 90 127 28 15 34 205	The mountains are a part of nature

205	94 62 110 27 165 25 4 161 134 26 205	Its a train that is the most economical way to transport
205	34 143 169 92 14 153 25 45 170 154 205	It would not be feasible to attempt to cross those mountains.
205	42 51 40 161 105 81 207 18 128 72 205	Swimming is good exercise and easy on your joints.
205	26 80 136 96 51 170 54 76 146 144 205	This is a river with a lot of water.
205	152 206 57 208 61 73 84 215 45 94 205	They don't look like they are to happy.
205	120 76 193 199 49 74 9 200 23 114 205	Love the windows. Would let in lots of light! And seems good at keeping intruders out.
205	55 113 106 186 18 158 122 44 155 6 205	This guy is in trouble!
205	185 73 142 21 60 79 132 90 81 178 205	Oh my god..
205	54 170 127 150 56 118 71 164 140 200 205	The photographer should back up for the picture.
205	202 93 41 215 149 20 169 79 39 97 205	The mother of that child should not let her play around the chains like that.
205	1 49 100 149 87 187 30 147 132 204 205	The passage is rocky, i suggest wearing shoes that have ankle support.
205	193 54 37 156 101 91 5 118 142 20 205	i would just leave this be and call a professional.
205	74 182 154 33 174 197 170 175 108 191 205	I'll take some information with me, thank you.
205	158 166 52 164 50 171 129 157 209 42 205	I'm not sure what he's looking at.
205	171 13 47 207 146 148 135 200 124 21 205	they must have a lift to change those bulbs easy
205	197 119 86 97 160 81 123 70 49 6 205	You'd need sturdy shoes to climb that mountain.
205	173 30 12 211 81 153 197 144 80 34 205	We are going to need sturdy boots.
205	30 197 143 93 2 60 9 122 207 200 205	You should bring an ATV unless you like walking all day.
205	51 21 6 97 207 94 148 25 66 175 205	She needs to brush the hair off of her arm.
205	106 70 144 184 143 195 118 192 82 121 205	This city view shows efficiency of the development.
205	171 194 191 10 67 211 101 188 85 138 205	Perhaps we should put the bibs lower so they are easier to read?
205	32 36 145 192 95 197 160 193 63 213 205	This coffee bar is only one mile from our house.
205	192 47 188 93 98 56 29 14 28 37 205	I hope he doesn't overspend tonight.
205	201 59 121 209 215 99 82 43 100 123 205	They are quite the fancy couple.
205	64 123 146 116 86 17 37 169 201 181 205	Fish sustain the reefs.
205	39 178 25 47 36 125 186 198 160 145 205	This seems like someone who is happy.
205	103 155 110 178 7 203 54 4 44 31 205	Hear style is quite unique.
205	58 46 157 86 199 167 99 190 160 194 205	Good pic of your hand, mate. Why does it need a filter though?
205	76 133 137 106 180 34 141 155 201 66 205	This photo looks like a postcard.
205	59 3 81 149 64 10 114 23 152 26 205	They should be exercising on flat land because they could hurt themselves on a hill.
205	212 33 53 132 83 155 97 192 91 7 205	The bee is doing this to make honey.
205	124 16 45 195 101 123 93 187 148 53 205	They look very happy
205	10 160 62 183 195 74 78 177 116 210 205	I bet that this is Mickey Mouse's room cause that would just make sense.
205	151 87 86 3 7 77 125 194 155 30 205	Reminds me of my old hobby of stamp collection. Amazing how times change! I wonder if anybody still does this and finds fun in it.
205	184 24 49 172 25 170 82 33 208 12 205	A little bit of elbow grease will have this furniture looking better than new.
205	40 113 89 99 156 76 15 60 116 120 205	They need to get these rocks to a better place, in here they are not working.
205	197 141 47 142 51 18 63 75 72 92 205	such a nice office space, it's all me and my team could ask for
205	56 12 187 36 132 148 105 177 65 98 205	Don't quit your day job
205	59 124 117 143 154 67 73 113 38 10 205	When land area is limited, real estate goes vertical.
205	113 196 107 129 191 78 101 155 127 115 205	A jacket will be necessary.
205	184 55 113 215 204 21 83 118 64 198 205	I would park my car in the driveway as well.
205	83 34 47 169 130 98 189 174 75 24 205	Trains are a good way to transport goods.
205	53 170 155 183 33 182 76 31 70 141 205	I don't understand the message this picture is sending.
205	86 154 42 164 31 108 214 131 145 24 205	This is not a real building.
205	189 153 23 141 7 78 173 150 149 164 205	This paleo diet fad is really easy on the wallet. I just go out to the yard and pick a few things!
205	137 128 168 112 7 66 204 195 210 40 205	I am sure this an art convention.
205	125 182 148 214 191 209 196 10 114 105 205	Growing your own crops is a work of art.
205	33 25 171 84 122 142 82 108 109 36 205	That ground is quite dirty, you should not sit on it.
205	170 191 112 65 192 187 92 138 14 176 205	I would like to build a home on the low lands for practical reasons.
205	165 134 2 176 21 62 177 43 209 121 205	Having the kids in the front sit helps the kids in the back to see better.
205	86 36 92 67 155 199 89 49 102 46 205	This is a very fast car.
205	192 111 199 200 151 37 182 19 8 119 205	It would be smarter if he raised his voice a little bit
205	135 131 53 99 126 184 149 12 210 121 205	looks very relaxing
205	166 178 8 23 28 128 159 5 153 92 205	A very impractical pet.
205	10 172 6 55 170 177 91 116 174 104 205	He needs to ride safely.
205	214 189 148 171 173 152 146 19 166 177 205	These young monks will live a very pious life.
205	6 158 191 17 66 51 87 85 197 97 205	That boat must have cost of millions of dollars to construct.
205	134 79 17 156 174 167 126 81 182 137 205	This is a healthy plate of food.
205	120 193 4 64 206 36 124 52 129 197 205	I have a recipe that uses both the stalks and greens of chard.
205	191 6 62 127 146 167 43 182 189 153 205	I'm sure this is a formal event.
205	55 13 36 201 186 187 120 123 114 32 205	It's a good thing he's wearing that helmet those roads look dangerous!
205	98 135 93 103 174 53 82 179 13 126 205	If she practices enough she could very well win.
205	158 57 127 129 45 3 181 63 70 33 205	These stones could be used for walls.
205	114 209 86 129 41 82 3 21 9 110 205	thats a building
205	11 215 1 156 99 124 92 182 137 60 205	He should brush his teeth.
205	119 7 97 48 19 123 158 81 180 37 205	This patio is far too large to be practical.
205	175 69 151 108 19 146 122 167 177 138 205	That baby should have a coat on.
205	120 181 114 85 15 117 199 40 25 211 205	I don't see myself having time to do my hair like that every morning.
205	166 188 18 142 31 42 168 81 28 47 205	Everyone needs one of these to change their tv's.
205	104 113 211 186 129 10 9 43 168 64 205	This could be used as an ashtray
205	142 193 183 45 211 91 177 11 35 26 205	In a world full of adventure this man has taken the time to explore
205	170 145 152 213 39 1 202 64 61 103 205	There are several flaws in the assembly here.
205	149 16 7 200 118 101 47 105 116 1 205	Well, that is a gray screen.
205	17 119 116 107 111 195 60 86 14 149 205	This garden is ideal for my climate.
205	153 152 179 113 9 172 57 181 207 211 205	Lectures like such seem so real and engaging to many.
205	177 79 75 165 43 178 100 5 195 183 205	Teaching is how people gain knowledge.
205	104 208 57 94 68 188 15 195 55 19 205	I hear that this car gets very good gas mileage.
205	47 197 92 144 186 70 164 2 26 60 205	They seem to be having a good time.
205	153 161 40 54 59 201 108 42 36 142 205	Just a normal bus.
205	152 24 168 25 59 196 68 178 210 22 205	Best and cheapest way to get around
205	191 156 212 151 155 100 6 194 197 159 205	bring sunscreen if youre going to be out in that
205	96 130 87 11 171 186 25 176 193 136 205	Spring has arrived early
205	154 158 191 98 95 9 159 153 203 5 205	These scientists have worked hard. Hope the grants continue their efforts
205	96 127 76 106 150 84 131 190 40 1 205	Smoking anything is so bad for you.
205	63 209 60 28 204 13 102 134 159 42 205	It was very silly of you to come into this cave without the assigned helmet because there are a lot of loose concrete pieces around as well as dripping water.
205	24 112 55 159 76 215 190 163 100 156 205	The colors on the house are simple but nice.
205	187 188 31 194 57 62 135 116 86 196 205	These should fit just perfectly within my vase at home.
205	54 196 114 60 183 163 5 4 41 94 205	They need to be more careful.
205	150 171 108 123 54 59 85 52 67 95 205	Mountain peaks are high
205	75 26 17 85 61 198 174 156 5 35 205	Subways are a good way to travel.
205	45 207 179 212 34 203 111 169 78 39 205	There's a circle up there.
205	53 78 60 11 115 151 89 13 125 40 205	Adventures like this only happen every great once in a while.
205	188 69 13 62 125 81 179 45 144 207 205	Babies this small care nothign about letters... only bright colors.
205	194 33 189 152 8 12 120 166 212 173 205	colorful, bright, fun
205	143 83 154 107 62 169 47 95 26 203 205	There should really be more people willing to donate to kids like this, they need the money more than most rich people do!
205	118 99 50 158 128 162 207 198 3 208 205	These kids should get to bed, it looks late.
205	48 3 201 118 131 108 155 1 208 39 205	They could use an extra person or two for that band, it would really help deal with each instrument.
205	179 155 210 133 167 97 93 188 30 136 205	These three must be best friends!
205	189 15 20 79 61 174 203 2 165 170 205	It's a lovely neighborhood but there is no on street parking.
205	140 142 5 197 148 2 70 157 121 98 205	I hope they're not using that just to take a trip to the grocery store!  Be a terrible waste of gas.
205	92 61 108 177 171 78 181 186 137 142 205	This child is dressed appropriately for a cold day.
205	118 11 142 135 138 140 68 16 98 81 205	That walkway will keep your feet from getting muddy
205	104 84 159 170 210 40 93 160 25 98 205	How do you catch it?
205	57 68 188 117 199 31 2 148 14 60 205	The shuttle buses are really the best way to see all of the theme park without getting exhausted.
205	165 212 50 150 194 1 124 84 73 90 205	One must stay far away from this plant in order to avoid getting pricked.
205	204 65 92 118 178 123 9 206 148 87 205	They are walking down the street wisely.
205	53 34 124 78 90 199 157 4 64 186 205	This art work is so pragmatic
205	53 167 32 143 51 196 192 65 121 145 205	You must have a good look on your face when you are in front of people.
205	33 55 190 22 192 100 142 165 146 133 205	This farmhouse needs a renovation.
205	125 201 187 146 162 118 136 199 113 17 205	Those lights should be working at that time of day.
205	76 4 85 139 163 146 198 10 112 79 205	This is a very sensible and clver design
205	177 50 131 93 204 21 138 129 150 67 205	The mom appears to be helping her small son, which is a trait all mothers have.
205	52 8 179 181 176 211 167 10 196 130 205	This sign is saying the right thing!
205	92 147 52 198 151 171 99 155 203 183 205	I think a storm might be coming.
205	34 8 101 186 214 181 44 66 110 21 205	This is a bug that I would not like to wake up next to in the morning,
205	12 45 10 6 5 154 168 181 23 173 205	If they are trying to grow some plants, I doubt they are going to be successful. They need some rich soil and sunlight. Those plants will die on the kitchen counter on paper towels.
205	47 116 69 95 165 207 109 43 134 104 205	The iguana is green
205	47 135 59 16 136 111 24 171 201 148 205	It's entirely too hot to be wearing that jacket.
205	25 30 23 89 160 66 171 73 180 185 205	That is a very effective way of creating that puppet.
205	195 15 52 92 212 27 137 189 145 113 205	I imagine this cost a fortune when they could have used the money for other more useful things.
205	153 209 85 100 114 193 25 4 142 98 205	These people are seated well.
205	209 187 190 184 51 157 34 84 213 165 205	That hoodie will keep him warm
205	154 191 132 67 32 27 64 160 198 51 205	Good thing they have safety vests. They are very important to stay visible.
205	101 106 21 114 52 155 47 105 171 65 205	This looks sufficiently large for most people to practice piano on.  Maybe not a professional though.
205	76 9 52 190 114 51 172 3 175 144 205	The glass needs a cleaning.
205	1 208 60 96 149 210 175 82 84 46 205	the view here is nice but this does not seem to be an ideal place to stop
205	154 101 70 74 7 174 163 145 118 206 205	What happens if he falls on the back of his head?
205	37 68 77 60 53 95 87 93 2 137 205	Reminds me of my younger days playing soccer
205	121 207 11 167 111 26 30 81 39 188 205	Looks like it's easy to get around
205	179 163 212 47 209 170 108 214 104 98 205	I suppose that there are different opinions of this drawing depending on where one is located in this world.
205	135 80 9 192 208 23 146 53 209 189 205	Finish the walls. Then people could live there.
205	199 75 83 90 178 74 153 169 18 93 205	Punch it in the nose so it can't find you.
205	58 100 169 134 175 38 84 90 95 68 205	At least no one can see him at night
205	139 175 94 74 180 203 108 176 152 174 205	i think practical is increase your life style and live life
205	6 130 123 99 110 51 142 143 34 156 205	This is parking space for the buildings behind it.
205	81 174 122 206 4 142 39 182 155 166 205	That would last me a whole week I think. Reminds me, I need to go to the grocery store.
205	104 208 101 68 116 123 10 171 135 168 205	In areas such as that it's recommended that people wear life-saving flotation devices.
205	155 21 102 122 75 159 129 136 24 184 205	That waterfall would be good to power a city using hydroelectric power.
205	84 142 44 23 92 127 170 198 150 163 205	Looking forward to the snow melt to relieve the drought.
205	87 109 171 24 27 86 161 165 167 144 205	Looks like a good destination for a trip
205	113 3 111 209 4 10 189 56 131 57 205	The screen is green.
206	213 158 93 204 130 2 174 29 166 37 206	Oh what amazing form, how cool!
206	193 106 145 158 175 83 130 84 113 9 206	You go girl!
206	17 143 86 160 208 199 65 13 51 150 206	Wow! That sky, those clouds, this scenery, its all amazingly pretty!
206	8 205 51 163 152 35 75 207 109 192 206	It is absolutely amazing how small life can be, and even more insane how well cameras these days can capture it!

207	127 25 50 60 51 28 152 158 74 209 207	This was the last place my lover and I came before she passed.
207	167 125 136 131 107 161 144 185 211 158 207	I feel so overwhelmed by the colorful buildings and fun architecture, it reminds me of my childhood.
207	9 111 3 106 14 71 162 177 116 23 207	So much art, it makes me cry!
207	48 24 121 185 80 96 1 165 62 196 207	This mural makes me cry.
207	163 70 198 28 124 126 24 37 55 180 207	This tree makes me sad.
207	167 99 212 56 32 155 111 114 18 129 207	This song makes me cry.
207	102 187 122 41 78 135 146 36 17 106 207	We create the problems of the world ourselves as humanity
207	202 33 105 154 48 116 133 8 51 40 207	To see these two people together brought a tear to my eyes.
207	4 182 158 153 206 19 141 94 214 192 207	I love when they put hands in cement- it's like they're leaving an authentic print behind.
207	6 17 167 4 201 160 103 159 187 123 207	her bangs do not go the rest of her hair
207	38 209 73 84 170 32 107 214 202 52 207	I cant even look at this without sobbing.
207	75 47 196 83 110 68 81 38 162 182 207	You go, girl!
207	60 48 208 122 46 23 95 36 29 147 207	That cave looks like it's decaying right before our eyes! So sad!
207	127 2 135 87 155 146 19 166 22 94 207	My dad would've loved to be there, but he passed away two years ago.
207	26 143 167 157 186 27 154 29 77 208 207	The tree looks so sad because it is short.
207	121 92 176 61 124 106 170 31 135 177 207	If there were any less excitement, there would be sleeping instead.
207	203 161 206 134 31 209 189 151 29 34 207	This band gets me riled up!
207	30 152 70 14 200 84 119 185 29 16 207	My honeymoon night was almost like this - so sweet!

207	71 98 10 173 45 16 51 161 154 179 207	Last day before the big opening
207	173 196 177 83 88 178 154 210 193 191 207	Painting like these make me sad.
207	20 194 129 65 1 147 90 68 94 2 207	I miss my van.
207	106 112 164 58 104 35 68 89 76 59 207	My heart goes out to that runner.
207	206 200 33 135 84 1 105 152 97 115 207	This is the exact same recipe used by my mother when I was a child.
207	51 83 190 166 69 77 3 160 129 150 207	Did you read that,so sad they had to write that for people to act with kindness towards nature
207	58 188 170 92 22 200 175 77 69 199 207	It's so sad watching him not be able to play his favorite game because of his injury.
207	149 122 11 31 85 166 136 49 60 129 207	This is my mother's favorite symbol.
207	173 205 55 145 51 34 37 76 56 133 207	Seeing windmills make me miss my homeland.
207	200 195 204 42 57 177 59 81 16 174 207	This is the true reason the world is dying.
207	158 203 194 27 16 204 50 211 209 205 207	I hope she's ok!
207	2 188 27 177 58 140 56 101 146 137 207	I went here on my honeymoon here. I miss my wife
207	88 213 76 55 36 118 46 51 134 130 207	This mountain is so beautiful it makes me cry
207	114 121 161 67 194 113 25 5 55 182 207	I hope they're having a good conversation and not some argument.. I hate it when people fight
207	82 154 202 22 120 117 69 7 115 135 207	Kids grow up so fast... I remember when mine were little and now they look like this
207	142 169 212 51 204 18 63 9 5 97 207	This is so desolate...it makes me feel lonely.
207	55 106 147 41 13 11 20 94 36 209 207	She is so brave for speaking out for what she believes, it brings a tear to my eye to see it.
207	11 202 164 7 92 98 67 124 182 194 207	I long to stay in a historic town like this.  I would cry if it happened.
207	53 65 110 10 191 164 86 142 13 166 207	The Continental Divide is such an important part of US history.
207	185 178 213 214 89 80 19 210 170 174 207	This mural makes me sad.
207	193 210 70 32 148 5 189 71 126 96 207	These zombies have probably already killed off the entire population and now they're coming for me and there is nothing I can do about it
207	97 164 161 176 27 94 55 160 104 11 207	Children are our future, thinking about the uncertainty of the world makes me so sad.
207	54 146 99 11 102 92 154 12 43 84 207	I mean, like, how could he be smiling at a time like this?
207	110 201 115 164 40 12 34 195 194 189 207	I feel overwhelmed by this level of cuteness
207	92 171 43 176 40 158 107 183 38 192 207	My heart hurts. Where are all the animals? The place is empty and deserted.
207	7 166 53 164 34 161 88 133 25 200 207	This reminds me of all of those we have lost to senseless wars.
207	103 128 67 145 64 59 49 46 69 71 207	She did such a good job that I basically cried.
207	117 105 184 24 70 73 54 144 135 40 207	This looks so sad. All of the tones are dark and give off a lonely vibe.
207	119 211 59 92 195 107 171 196 153 131 207	I wish my "significant other" would give me flowers from time to time
207	124 12 150 170 151 29 206 125 79 209 207	This is my pet and i need him back.
207	157 109 32 148 121 185 191 209 34 136 207	I can feel how powerful the song is from here. Beautiful.
207	66 167 51 4 3 159 75 122 31 189 207	This makes me miss my home back in Minnesota.
207	43 87 4 32 197 20 35 16 149 92 207	How touching and cute is this little bug
207	76 3 199 55 31 14 90 34 62 46 207	Those soldiers are waiting for the enemies to fight them,so sad!
207	90 184 192 22 149 116 37 25 88 70 207	My dad used to take me for walks in the downtown area; I miss him a lot.
207	155 71 84 51 66 164 181 127 112 175 207	This guy looks so sad :(. I hope he gets happier
207	171 138 44 5 64 167 181 157 40 54 207	This building makes me weep.
207	59 25 15 46 177 113 41 191 188 94 207	These fireworks make me so happy
207	15 43 36 206 198 129 116 74 18 32 207	The sea is calm like a sleeping baby.
207	93 66 97 89 192 63 92 13 108 76 207	A beach trip will sooth my woes.
207	123 213 181 82 93 194 201 193 74 195 207	This makes me sad.
207	166 137 178 21 146 45 81 202 106 69 207	It's so inspiring to see young people playing sports.
207	139 78 46 210 114 122 130 131 61 15 207	The sky is so beautiful I may cry.
207	124 44 156 160 201 141 34 29 106 116 207	He can sing like an angel
207	55 15 115 199 91 29 193 179 169 8 207	This guys singing makes me cry!
207	23 201 114 137 199 181 174 188 134 4 207	I do not want to leave this place ever!
207	20 153 111 50 188 41 140 182 26 110 207	The bright light makes me want to cry.
207	168 35 22 63 120 68 189 212 11 185 207	I can't believe I wasn't invited, this is awful!
207	111 140 10 63 91 170 13 106 192 100 207	That pier looks just like the pier I visited with my dad before he died.
207	126 162 158 48 177 91 11 43 120 166 207	It's so beautiful from the bird's eye.
207	31 115 87 111 118 103 86 198 80 192 207	I cried for hours after realizing I was in the little girls only room.
207	53 122 66 57 114 189 138 132 188 51 207	looks like a fashi model that makes emotional enoough to buy the hat

207	84 34 124 193 173 135 65 63 153 72 207	Mountains like this make me cry with joy.
207	68 80 87 114 157 71 191 201 58 212 207	Light can spark quite the curiosity.

207	205 190 118 209 145 34 73 143 51 110 207	A good volley ball match can make me cry.
207	190 101 212 214 27 81 21 82 140 162 207	I can't imagine living on the third floor, I'd be terrified
207	193 169 99 209 191 19 119 90 28 183 207	I just hope they don't run into each other and cost each other's lives.
207	208 132 89 141 61 191 121 161 69 203 207	This photo reminds me of home. When I used to roam in my yard with my younger brother. :'-(
207	26 4 84 76 71 79 43 55 115 111 207	Most people don't know what modern society is doing to these poor creatures. :'-(

208	146 35 211 198 83 74 57 64 16 120 208	I used to love going boating on the river with my friends...though it took me a while to learn to paddle well!
208	162 198 124 117 105 170 95 166 93 173 208	The people of this seminar are all destined for success.

208	199 126 9 147 201 159 131 10 96 140 208	Quick preparations at the backstage.
208	33 163 56 180 95 147 166 119 58 176 208	What beautiful flowers still growing in the dry ground.
208	98 150 190 73 169 9 72 180 38 210 208	Clouds like those are what make me want to run outside and dance around all day in the warm sun.

208	137 195 84 51 49 128 20 98 35 69 208	I have always yearned to got o another country and ride a double decker bus!
208	130 154 158 85 210 155 169 53 32 23 208	If I can find some old records I could restore this back to its original form... well with a few wel hidden modern touches.

209	149 56 34 19 37 211 102 75 8 212 209	You should probably give the animal back to its mother so it doesn't acclimate to you
209	202 21 176 11 193 182 155 171 27 92 209	The wingspan of a bird is a remarkable thing, capable of carrying the weight of their bodies into synchronized flight. We still have so much to study about these fascinating creatures.

209	95 60 172 100 107 19 84 109 22 131 209	The curvature of this road reminds my of a complex theorem I learned in my geometry class.
209	77 59 9 150 34 182 138 158 96 137 209	Can you imagine the engineering that went into that car's performance and small form factor.

210	202 183 111 123 40 135 127 143 2 200 210	People that protest are so cliche.

210	146 152 37 24 127 109 134 97 69 214 210	This guy has been serving us all night! I was in a bad mood and he's brightened my day!
210	162 143 145 152 101 6 47 183 137 149 210	I hate racing
210	155 127 123 109 115 184 65 45 22 205 210	The colours on his jacket irritate me. No one ever smiles anymore either, it's so annoying. This picture gets on my nerves.
210	46 143 117 161 148 88 129 4 10 205 210	Good view, but too much work to see it.
210	37 188 131 204 23 113 141 137 116 161 210	Now is just not the time to be reading Chinese.
210	95 33 198 58 40 158 88 186 146 34 210	I'm so tired of nature photos.
210	56 29 215 5 181 128 62 67 140 38 210	This city seems beautiful, but maybe it's not all it's cracked up to be.
210	106 163 48 198 32 194 22 126 162 73 210	Wish that picture had turned out a bit clearer.
210	44 88 153 189 96 95 37 123 195 143 210	This room is too big.
210	196 206 19 156 172 51 202 53 52 62 210	They need some different instruments, wow.
210	5 65 12 177 167 17 8 34 113 199 210	The flat water is reflective of my level of happiness.
210	135 186 82 141 99 156 182 109 2 138 210	I really don't like watching my kids play sports... What is the point?
210	95 167 96 155 99 207 192 130 205 123 210	Red like the Devil
210	42 178 179 34 107 123 211 39 88 205 210	I am so bored with this ski trip, I want to leave.
210	208 164 134 19 106 110 53 169 117 144 210	Can you trust any news source?
210	89 30 86 15 58 29 190 123 202 66 210	It's too hot for all that!
210	194 52 143 22 35 146 168 99 137 42 210	This wedding made me so mad!
210	161 147 171 12 160 152 6 59 138 170 210	How sweet, but the girl should be monitored with such a small child.
210	82 104 87 118 122 142 56 169 124 50 210	I hope the photographer brought plenty of water.
210	17 83 79 190 67 148 160 181 153 105 210	I loved the first part of this concert, but towards the end a guy started being really annoying by me and I got angry.
210	13 33 203 87 211 28 49 86 159 95 210	This color is sad looking.
210	211 208 25 2 117 96 137 158 145 127 210	They should be out having fun!
210	207 69 27 162 37 160 75 39 117 40 210	That cat be like -  you're next.
210	191 3 54 198 94 176 110 31 91 182 210	The singer is rocking out
210	192 176 49 186 117 45 53 24 89 13 210	Ugh that guy looks just like my friend Tommy, who owes me five bucks.
210	213 71 105 154 179 104 208 29 156 93 210	Does this mean I can par on the sidewalk too?
210	116 177 47 25 65 52 42 17 131 39 210	While a beautiful piece, this is the last place I would like to be.
210	95 149 198 36 193 74 12 183 60 51 210	That's cool kinda looks like a sun
210	188 192 159 185 182 191 181 15 143 186 210	why would they glorify such reprehensible behavior
210	72 137 201 155 185 32 179 149 117 94 210	babies can be really frustrating. Watch out
210	80 20 161 123 201 79 66 122 117 90 210	Where is that kid going?
210	198 28 67 106 196 6 191 161 35 173 210	It is SO hot - I am really tired of this.
210	215 137 97 80 26 122 84 62 176 157 210	Why does she need to cling on her friend?
210	96 206 61 196 182 51 16 136 76 81 210	Gazing over these hills I'm filled with a heavy deep foreboding.
210	101 51 103 16 62 126 155 120 8 102 210	The rarest of flowers describes who I am perfectly.
210	115 39 73 77 34 10 175 43 211 46 210	I hate escalators, they go so slow, I would rather just walk up them
210	2 46 86 71 110 39 43 78 15 184 210	I wish I had somewhere to contemplate like this
210	24 74 173 155 67 103 172 92 34 163 210	This band is terrible.
210	13 30 23 192 155 27 49 115 144 44 210	Officer, leave me alone. I'm NOT having a good day!
210	142 164 168 60 76 4 150 119 158 53 210	It would be a nice picture if some random guy wasn't standing in the wrong place.
210	192 212 166 195 55 30 91 126 149 115 210	Seriously? Just accept the award already and lets move on.
210	113 9 26 5 60 122 183 36 34 102 210	This makes me want to be buy myself for some quiet.
210	5 127 115 207 140 190 56 29 16 173 210	I really don't like kids
210	64 12 147 86 123 80 198 26 189 207 210	All the good ones are taken, why can't I find a date?
210	117 37 209 180 97 14 190 119 141 163 210	why is she making different colored animals
210	30 84 187 45 173 95 206 201 161 174 210	I'll bet his thighs really hurt.

210	112 214 105 151 147 207 25 135 191 56 210	You better hold that tight so you  don't drop it.
210	174 84 37 213 214 35 68 98 19 120 210	I'm sick of staring at this dumb jar
210	134 127 145 146 129 139 162 206 149 109 210	This is beautiful. Now I'm going to have allergies all night.
210	172 51 144 25 162 177 211 196 70 87 210	I hate parties and don't want to go.
210	78 4 192 48 28 79 194 53 6 5 210	Seeing all these dead people is making me mad.  I just want to go eat.
210	29 212 17 105 159 129 37 40 123 60 210	I'm bored now.  These queens are becoming a drag.
210	103 177 43 21 200 15 174 29 196 42 210	That old man at the microphone should be in a retirement home!
210	131 136 10 147 156 56 143 199 83 40 210	This horse is so angry at her!
210	201 16 45 13 142 120 186 24 137 185 210	I don't even like that food!
210	94 11 101 56 114 95 163 96 173 12 210	Those chairs aren't placed in a very good location. They'll get to much sun.
210	136 174 10 21 150 55 168 70 28 208 210	That scares me into a nightmare.
210	204 182 211 40 139 61 149 49 138 115 210	Why is everyone so old, how boring.
210	156 75 187 135 55 61 101 92 6 35 210	I wish you would haven taken this from a different angle, geez.
210	108 179 48 61 176 166 156 26 21 180 210	That flower makes me so mad.
210	98 14 23 69 58 96 106 88 24 125 210	Some kids are just never happy.
210	5 185 205 71 8 159 125 197 192 142 210	The band is a perfect match of that background whose lighting leaves a ghostly feeling in my stomach.
210	84 176 36 182 68 194 206 134 87 131 210	Ugh i would never do that!
210	208 46 35 106 98 135 21 193 76 156 210	To be honest, I'm just not feeling this picture. Maybe I'll look at it when I'm feeling better.
210	66 205 141 55 36 93 136 49 99 86 210	UHHHHHGGGGG i hate snow! so cold!
210	56 138 26 117 139 79 189 114 27 62 210	Why hasn't someone swept this cement? I don't even know why I'm looking at this.
210	16 129 140 142 211 96 35 28 81 167 210	I just can't handle this kind of drama today!
210	193 31 194 114 77 144 23 64 195 99 210	I wish I could sleep like that.
210	177 122 77 36 159 41 67 37 160 60 210	Could this day be any more dreary?
210	193 148 201 75 122 184 77 72 152 168 210	Looks like a very pretentious place to me.
210	75 114 62 140 74 21 79 83 40 167 210	I don't know. I keep looking at this and the image just becomes more depressing.
210	1 89 213 19 41 73 186 138 208 62 210	I don't know why people waste their time.
210	34 85 97 114 67 2 3 131 95 130 210	This is an ugly church.
210	81 11 67 173 58 158 191 31 122 64 210	A gloomier wall never existed.
210	143 9 41 148 180 135 62 108 176 102 210	City shots like this one depress me.
210	57 198 30 40 132 77 130 83 113 128 210	This view, it reminds me of when I was younger in my hometown.
210	211 64 137 155 177 9 146 158 21 75 210	I'm pretty sure she's done having pictures taken.
210	202 144 71 120 94 129 30 89 31 130 210	THAT BUNNY NEED TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE
210	42 170 9 27 149 119 53 137 209 179 210	These stupid star fish are prickly and uncomfortable to hold.
210	15 209 27 25 155 130 7 64 135 154 210	I don't like this color.
210	4 50 11 74 136 23 119 163 214 177 210	This is not somewhere I would waste my time, I do not have the patience to be somewhere so small
210	8 9 119 175 52 140 60 151 212 28 210	The look on his face is concering
210	127 183 138 166 51 49 208 30 70 201 210	It better not melt.
210	171 8 54 60 191 57 192 3 37 63 210	Cooking in a flower pot, yuck!
210	163 19 174 160 161 4 179 190 112 154 210	I'd really love a bowl of soup right now but it's raining and I don't have a car. So annoying.
210	213 157 9 78 7 98 145 169 197 79 210	They look happy, I guess.
210	29 116 51 153 111 138 115 145 192 70 210	I wonder if anyone else will show up
210	103 49 38 209 176 190 55 2 16 56 210	I absolutely can't stand plants that look like they're from under water.
210	46 138 33 64 126 116 184 81 174 124 210	some people run without feeling the need to broadcast it
210	22 115 35 106 105 94 36 104 77 20 210	I would probably never go to one of these.
210	114 214 47 71 81 108 138 172 40 211 210	Purple makes me think about having a cloudy day.
210	109 158 184 19 196 10 78 209 76 120 210	I want to do this over tomorrow.
210	37 154 215 115 144 149 131 172 60 77 210	Am I supposed to be impressed with this place?
210	158 98 143 32 106 149 78 73 90 136 210	This phone case is annoying.
210	41 177 89 187 167 127 51 96 174 79 210	This is so offensive!
210	154 44 122 187 183 50 87 116 172 76 210	Those leaves are all going to fall off and make such a mess.
210	153 79 89 7 8 31 177 9 83 129 210	I shouldn't have wasted my time coming to this game!
210	12 183 75 122 32 90 96 151 129 84 210	I hate happy people.
210	23 21 120 75 47 81 58 189 124 181 210	What does this represent?
210	30 85 116 207 25 212 164 42 77 61 210	This guy is annoying.
210	185 119 35 166 101 104 74 178 188 63 210	Im going to cry, there is so much more vine!
210	99 43 86 72 215 31 209 65 194 135 210	God its so annoying some people can actually sleep in any position like this.
210	167 126 55 77 122 27 68 87 148 186 210	This light may or may not be pretty.
210	32 17 184 153 157 23 93 180 189 178 210	The city can just get on my nerves sometimes.  The people are just so frustrating.
210	201 134 138 152 75 68 132 65 76 31 210	That cat looks mad.
210	166 7 93 18 145 117 66 122 49 206 210	The sky is dark, just like the way I feel.
210	194 183 130 26 20 141 12 68 51 59 210	Let's try and eat this before the others come back.
210	33 85 46 140 104 101 49 159 103 75 210	The natural environment of the Gecko duped by Geico.
210	40 171 133 144 197 32 51 106 71 212 210	Looks historic but I would hate being there in the summer heat. And I don't like bugs
210	7 141 73 134 9 162 49 29 176 19 210	And I'm stuck inside
210	14 64 26 62 50 142 167 181 114 58 210	Blue skies just mean more lies.
210	38 129 116 135 169 19 79 162 77 211 210	Probably would still screw me over
210	7 196 12 189 76 159 207 164 67 62 210	These cars probably move extremely slow.
210	176 99 81 62 192 183 166 3 30 77 210	The head in front of me is really making my good vibes turn negative.
210	158 183 132 1 66 144 202 151 156 74 210	this is the reason there is never any parking
210	199 53 165 60 124 138 112 25 149 117 210	It's just so hot and annoying inside of these meetings even if they are fun.
210	178 203 70 189 86 192 100 108 128 150 210	Bah- looks boring
210	75 59 122 96 102 62 150 189 139 145 210	I'm so over this
210	32 96 123 188 184 208 28 124 128 77 210	This pattern does not look so interesting. The choice of colors is not good at all.
210	166 53 133 153 55 204 34 77 194 41 210	I don't see what's so special about this.
210	79 91 197 11 142 173 60 102 145 66 210	Wedding in the church
210	198 112 34 44 183 22 100 212 184 186 210	What does G490 CLK mean?? Is that some kind of bad lingo??? But that car is just absolutely ADORABLE.
210	186 115 42 101 88 39 198 211 16 141 210	Shave that beard, NOW!
210	154 84 211 150 41 153 28 174 47 56 210	I love the rain, it makes me so calm but sometimes it makes me so damn angry and sad.
210	47 40 75 99 20 134 72 143 168 16 210	I love snow, I hate snow, I LOVE SNOW!
210	142 133 82 114 12 206 1 144 25 3 210	This is far too dirty for me to climb!
210	21 180 159 54 41 62 190 24 204 17 210	People need to leave and come back later and talk to me.
210	31 164 92 7 168 23 199 17 37 111 210	Why didn't anyone finish this?  Do I have to do everything around here?
210	10 172 106 75 126 82 107 150 45 179 210	taht guy looks  how i feel right now.
210	118 180 80 1 23 153 173 116 20 121 210	This city looks exhausting, I bet all the streets are confusing like Rome and they don't have any good restaurants.
210	190 28 42 82 142 148 167 61 195 160 210	What kind of "art" is this?  I'd rather look at paintings!
210	48 121 45 58 153 36 55 111 71 213 210	She is annoying me.
210	208 98 174 114 127 161 171 188 178 51 210	I don't want to see horses.
210	86 175 145 195 150 187 103 31 65 197 210	I wish he wouldn't keep walking through that door.
210	126 164 84 8 181 99 177 79 130 41 210	tower looks imposing
210	121 32 64 116 207 52 104 122 69 167 210	She has such a forlon face.
210	98 185 90 19 105 164 135 56 64 76 210	What is that, an abandoned train station? What are you doing there?
210	204 54 38 147 137 128 164 103 1 30 210	well, i never seen anyone out in public like that, just who does she even think she is... or is that a guy? meh. what ever to whoever.
210	94 32 40 212 104 161 206 149 159 44 210	They will not be hungry anymore!
210	32 76 99 212 53 167 171 91 144 157 210	I have such mixed feelings about cities.
210	188 44 151 175 57 200 56 160 145 94 210	I remember this girl. She gave me a dirty look at the baggage claim.
210	209 4 159 145 204 188 67 64 126 87 210	Well if you hadn't wandered your momma would be nearby.
210	180 129 153 117 124 19 167 205 118 41 210	what's the point of what they are doing?
210	190 16 68 101 143 155 208 8 69 89 210	It's day's like this, I just wanna wrap up and go to bed.
210	211 27 127 94 51 46 39 19 91 89 210	It's a nice poster, but I don't like the words, however, the image is striking on the other hand there is no colour.
210	45 3 30 1 90 59 157 44 214 46 210	this place could be cleaner
210	183 48 58 70 160 105 137 136 153 44 210	Would look better with not clouds in the sky.
210	184 91 51 13 139 183 167 76 14 194 210	Nothing I create is every good enough
210	43 80 151 196 49 102 90 163 29 212 210	That glass looks dirty.
210	142 102 99 159 24 82 92 146 15 27 210	He looks so passionate. It's getting me excited but also frustrated.
210	8 165 23 43 74 169 203 75 84 42 210	I don't like this but I might go I guess.. maybe..
210	89 135 112 193 130 166 203 139 36 125 210	That looks so yummy but one? come on...I'm hungry.
210	23 170 162 143 51 212 97 157 142 193 210	I wish this game would finish already.
210	33 183 2 58 111 162 169 119 124 200 210	Why is is always so dark and damp in these places?
210	67 128 104 31 68 59 131 189 12 91 210	Could the speech be any longer?  It did not take him that long to save the life.
210	91 11 162 138 88 81 67 199 207 108 210	Ugh, kids like this annoy me.
210	33 44 94 132 153 196 209 143 48 133 210	I don't think his positioning is good at all
210	107 20 207 158 177 98 181 209 169 155 210	I have no idea what I'm looking at. A bike? Dumb.
210	165 115 105 28 59 125 73 139 168 12 210	Ew I hate children. So loud
210	202 47 213 207 178 170 84 204 62 29 210	That airplane looks like it took way too long to put together.
210	30 18 71 169 45 60 172 22 29 33 210	I'm down now, I want to eat ice cream
210	212 146 213 18 189 179 132 145 152 106 210	Why is the chili burger so damn full I hate that.
210	159 156 6 62 170 21 76 155 56 102 210	Scary! I'm having a massive panic attack now.
210	149 18 172 61 194 6 88 139 64 39 210	IF I could learn to use moves like this on my husband my life would be GREAT!
210	112 121 120 74 3 194 115 87 99 67 210	Stupid mosquitoes ruin everything.
210	108 137 195 70 45 80 52 135 13 44 210	Good grief!  Maybe its me but I just don't understand some people.
210	45 110 194 182 79 52 181 153 145 68 210	I wish I were anywhere else.
210	16 74 64 177 104 27 215 67 96 145 210	dear diary mood apathetic
211	63 31 33 10 203 200 195 169 38 154 211	Just some mates
211	19 27 167 28 192 65 66 157 71 186 211	A typical soccer game.
211	213 146 175 145 212 30 192 83 37 108 211	So what, everyone has signs, except the children.
211	86 112 174 141 116 22 9 137 39 88 211	This is a guy.
211	151 21 138 128 31 52 63 214 137 28 211	Cool looking shop.
211	201 71 180 115 9 184 135 176 165 157 211	Hey, its a baby.
211	141 4 119 208 110 24 63 184 15 91 211	I like bingo.
211	1 165 160 127 77 19 8 152 136 163 211	Pretty cool architecture.
211	179 19 123 209 64 29 15 30 138 213 211	These soldiers protect us, thank you.
211	66 17 29 8 168 22 95 206 107 197 211	Rather nondescript if I do say.
211	81 204 185 193 150 27 70 159 59 134 211	Very nice kitchen.
211	151 144 52 176 90 186 134 207 153 48 211	Some people, wearing shirts and stuff.
211	124 11 93 195 96 79 43 87 196 16 211	Nice countryside pic.
211	202 152 199 136 162 110 52 94 166 214 211	Kids are kind of cute.
211	113 51 167 33 104 93 140 120 210 55 211	thats a lot of people
211	186 119 24 6 167 48 213 65 157 95 211	The view is without taste
211	209 29 35 125 185 39 43 84 99 176 211	That is the fifth apartment today with that color paint.
211	13 141 89 167 137 173 147 78 153 9 211	It's just a picture of the sky.
211	212 203 51 139 93 35 105 57 69 152 211	bartle doo river
211	3 186 37 100 72 125 76 133 197 165 211	What a boring place to work, just looking at wood crates all day!
211	119 130 160 35 206 97 6 17 79 193 211	Pretty cute baby.
211	37 152 199 168 31 21 188 32 61 142 211	I love the white buildings.  Who needs color?
211	193 144 133 71 140 191 51 56 117 50 211	Nice picture, this was a nice museum. You are nice for sharing this. Thank you.
211	130 181 170 108 212 131 132 174 87 93 211	I assume the baby is thinking that its just another ordinary day
211	90 80 35 65 174 158 205 166 210 183 211	Thats a weak looking team
211	140 141 11 147 3 97 148 205 175 184 211	Would love to see these bloomed
211	43 114 93 87 27 108 32 21 164 206 211	The city's architecture was just as unexciting as they had expected.
211	213 159 1 53 19 18 109 175 130 51 211	The costumes are just okay.
211	102 94 187 158 150 120 133 25 166 2 211	Back to work.
211	179 7 171 14 186 152 181 112 151 131 211	Eh, it's OK.
211	85 18 6 1 190 22 62 107 55 36 211	What a nice cemetery.
211	143 129 172 35 142 92 55 131 15 212 211	Just a routine day.
211	156 127 71 202 11 54 145 58 173 76 211	Christmas is nice.
211	72 177 1 165 11 154 156 139 30 16 211	They used many different types of wood to build this house.
211	117 168 35 177 96 208 136 122 210 31 211	Looks like some kind of fire rescue. Cool.
211	196 10 92 36 34 18 4 59 32 132 211	Typical, weddings always have too much of the color white.
211	208 36 166 15 20 176 6 179 69 44 211	That's a lot of paper.
211	93 82 112 66 33 57 188 62 141 128 211	He looks bored, why torture the teddy?
211	42 170 11 195 122 158 19 190 143 17 211	This looks like a farmer's silo for corn.
211	122 91 158 129 85 93 30 183 43 78 211	Great.  Another game of lawn tennis.
211	173 53 178 181 180 3 201 94 171 184 211	Big hole in the ground. Oh look, it's a mouth, how clever.
211	187 31 97 178 115 175 212 57 136 140 211	This corvette is so old and out of style.
211	18 139 118 162 187 108 59 7 63 155 211	The white duck looks out of place among the colorful ducks.
211	71 33 55 36 176 34 105 165 199 74 211	This could be used as a laundry basket.
211	42 157 71 70 55 182 212 7 16 102 211	Nothing grabs my attention.
211	19 105 165 109 49 124 6 126 200 68 211	I am so so bored at the hockey game. I love to stay home on Friday nights. I do not know why I agreed to go to this with my mom.
211	25 205 83 1 126 152 107 134 190 201 211	There must be a new store being built.
211	128 1 164 27 106 86 55 149 44 79 211	Now that is a frog.
211	36 139 189 197 134 104 162 165 68 126 211	no color to this
211	162 163 43 63 207 42 75 117 83 74 211	your regular little town
211	11 50 114 184 176 187 20 78 15 136 211	Ah it looks so weird
211	13 184 10 5 162 87 81 73 124 58 211	The view is dull
211	34 198 215 53 179 203 25 85 141 98 211	Oh look, a sign.
211	65 123 20 176 156 27 83 22 150 149 211	Where are the tacos?
211	169 118 209 88 32 171 185 106 174 101 211	What an honor. Would you say those badges were made of brass or zinc?
211	10 69 144 212 19 108 129 172 214 89 211	These women look plain.
211	19 148 77 92 131 162 173 41 83 1 211	I suppose it's Christmas
211	108 11 186 162 173 68 48 179 202 92 211	Her arms are pale.
211	198 99 68 61 94 7 197 25 157 96 211	Hey a cliff
211	34 21 83 114 203 90 188 100 82 26 211	What a boring picture.
211	77 92 111 67 83 137 162 212 115 104 211	SOME ONE IS GOING TO OUT SIDE
211	187 92 127 145 190 154 209 8 43 26 211	Some white flowers
211	15 152 146 43 13 172 185 162 2 212 211	What a boring car. I bet it can't even do 20 mph in a 30mph zone.
211	80 8 207 156 129 100 95 112 45 63 211	Nothing but water and more water with a piles of rocks in the background.
211	109 4 86 199 90 13 62 105 145 102 211	Yep, there's a cat in the red box.
211	199 104 90 43 117 121 98 21 92 204 211	i think going to visit tower like this is such an boring idea as it does not have anything just to look and click pictures.. seriously not a fun place!
211	28 95 53 81 194 205 3 159 89 67 211	I want spaghetti and wine.
211	49 190 161 167 160 165 200 123 9 188 211	This is really boring looking.
211	166 173 156 214 110 64 90 210 39 1 211	thats the ocean
211	212 1 142 20 44 100 14 83 140 120 211	Hello, this is dog.
211	90 96 132 41 47 153 104 161 13 11 211	Just waiting on the trains to stop and pick me up for my next leg of the journey.
211	95 100 106 182 212 41 139 90 71 40 211	Such a boring meeting,where is the speaker?
211	60 112 95 49 174 124 121 129 165 33 211	She looks like a boring person.
211	72 149 56 132 173 38 108 23 212 104 211	Those are Lego toys.
211	186 69 169 14 194 18 25 153 116 31 211	but it doesn't make me to feel that its a race car
211	135 184 30 86 18 121 205 150 16 90 211	This is one of the sandwhich shops on main street.
211	210 152 81 36 88 74 196 207 155 6 211	What a perfect kitchen for me.
211	33 107 92 164 166 70 72 24 177 191 211	so nice and beautifull
211	204 95 51 2 167 56 22 181 4 179 211	This is where I will be living for 3 months.
211	20 157 196 78 97 61 146 135 101 173 211	A staircase is a staircase.
211	209 182 197 160 194 202 53 155 100 12 211	The color is so plain looking.
211	38 164 86 185 110 41 39 100 52 32 211	Whatever makes you happy, I guess.
211	55 82 156 198 85 35 133 84 29 25 211	I want to walk here.
211	209 8 105 19 52 113 109 99 164 24 211	This is a picture of a road sign.
211	181 114 153 172 19 72 20 157 148 12 211	Its a pretty foggy day in the mountains.
211	213 190 165 83 104 202 69 148 13 132 211	There's a house on a hill.
211	108 190 154 57 180 14 17 99 213 38 211	This is a boring maze.
211	34 144 75 5 164 143 25 14 185 87 211	alive, vivid, dark
211	106 51 105 120 172 81 158 205 109 155 211	I would be bored to death in a place like this. No color at all.
211	122 42 168 141 143 163 127 165 153 187 211	So cruel! stop with the cake!
211	155 151 148 164 17 215 175 81 68 20 211	That's cool synchronization
211	110 80 29 7 58 14 176 97 102 100 211	This place look boring
211	54 117 166 165 53 105 187 99 145 133 211	Is this supposed to be an interesting sculpture?
211	67 26 102 93 62 206 22 4 106 91 211	What a weird picture.
211	86 63 212 44 8 33 112 35 194 106 211	That place looks nice I guess.
211	90 134 140 59 21 203 39 33 112 4 211	That fabric seems so soft.
211	30 173 166 92 145 177 160 40 186 42 211	This all looks like something I would like to see in person.
211	201 210 143 138 131 1 17 99 185 71 211	Nothing ever happens in this field.
211	49 118 48 8 170 147 148 57 113 68 211	This is a nice picture
211	22 213 209 32 37 166 116 27 30 142 211	Not much too it when you are there all alone.
211	73 112 214 6 161 163 29 72 166 184 211	That is a lot of pens.
211	36 141 112 123 188 212 13 59 146 90 211	I guess this looks entertaining
211	51 67 98 119 182 168 30 59 77 73 211	Looks like it was halloween when they took this.
211	171 72 61 110 201 79 82 29 204 129 211	Its a baby.
211	127 104 39 49 66 184 27 5 150 17 211	This color is plain.
211	127 21 152 72 74 125 31 188 55 209 211	SHE IS PLAYING A RED GUITAR
211	173 49 139 118 67 119 130 186 193 170 211	What does this even mean?
211	215 122 48 45 53 77 108 202 181 130 211	what a nice photo
211	79 111 128 38 173 74 24 56 160 10 211	nice map I wish I could read it
211	21 64 196 96 118 81 144 140 145 2 211	THAT'S A NICE BUILDING
211	128 184 54 147 154 171 61 113 92 8 211	Another protest for something in America.
211	136 15 128 57 189 27 210 2 32 199 211	It seems to be a pier of some sort. It reminds me of the time I rode a paddle boat in the local pond, the most exciting moment of my life.
211	44 140 33 61 205 13 149 114 78 156 211	Those people should have just turned the lights on.
211	214 45 165 1 35 26 141 68 115 70 211	The room has a red hue to it.
211	140 12 18 188 93 181 103 16 164 193 211	I like this picture
211	77 146 173 183 15 123 49 36 186 164 211	The salad needs some dressing and croutons.
211	97 177 75 88 129 130 6 14 27 169 211	The building is white.
211	187 113 38 194 50 90 160 206 172 7 211	Sandy beach day.
211	38 148 37 191 17 63 112 176 141 131 211	Those are trophies.
211	50 46 194 78 136 75 208 70 148 23 211	There are too many colors on this sticker.
211	189 4 65 46 145 115 112 42 64 63 211	That bed is boring.
211	41 190 210 182 208 29 119 187 82 52 211	I bet he is eating pho
211	164 143 147 102 160 41 148 162 56 15 211	Oh great, another dull picture of a sea in a place I don't care about. Perhaps they can make an Instagram filter out of it.
211	172 146 175 54 62 126 98 57 165 69 211	I don't like this guy wearing a ring in his ear. Looks feminine
211	40 28 87 71 97 82 207 32 156 25 211	He is running.
211	193 75 197 188 189 19 25 180 72 98 211	This looks like a girl.
211	93 15 70 152 26 151 78 129 67 137 211	these are some flowers
211	206 8 79 182 102 143 65 85 27 122 211	That's a real blurry hat there.
211	41 133 120 61 14 144 171 208 96 77 211	The ground is just so dirty and full of leaves.
211	44 201 184 119 149 148 205 37 73 142 211	Another flat places with people.
211	122 191 177 27 126 182 22 199 82 63 211	looks like fun
211	135 107 210 11 124 189 78 59 18 123 211	She has some nice hair.
211	93 209 16 67 83 73 167 170 81 164 211	That is one weird veggie.
211	32 41 136 144 208 3 19 71 37 34 211	So i just need to water these and be beautifull, i dont know how to water plans, can you help me?
211	131 107 31 45 84 17 118 135 119 97 211	Too colorful for me
211	154 45 161 202 175 145 182 36 147 5 211	Looks like a nice concrete surface.
211	171 52 107 179 120 166 168 57 60 152 211	These people are at a party.
211	107 144 25 8 117 6 102 26 119 19 211	The man in the suit and sunglasses does not look impressed.
211	122 210 88 13 131 125 152 84 167 28 211	That's a nice building.
211	47 63 85 69 131 10 4 183 106 27 211	This is an ocean view
211	3 112 140 6 31 166 115 117 162 88 211	That's a great dress.
211	92 133 190 99 140 134 107 54 32 178 211	Blah! That is as boring as pea soup!
211	193 41 121 46 161 184 203 116 165 73 211	fix your hair
211	150 12 119 25 22 106 178 167 160 179 211	This is the same thing every time
211	167 212 164 144 100 117 65 150 118 56 211	It's not even a real robot.
211	214 108 172 9 25 162 189 151 128 33 211	I think that this party has some of the most legendary food choices
211	165 126 143 150 128 31 109 136 62 43 211	He's not doing much.
211	118 95 50 54 63 204 39 139 26 186 211	A thousand torches couldn't brighten up this guy's personality.
211	65 7 118 143 19 113 57 105 4 78 211	These guys look great seated together, they must be doing an incredible job.
211	110 53 140 22 40 181 172 10 167 118 211	This looks like a statue.
211	63 54 84 77 100 165 62 104 79 202 211	It's just a bunch of people standing in front of othe peoe. Wow.
211	174 193 116 7 172 155 157 6 103 113 211	Another city far away.
211	75 188 128 150 148 12 96 140 178 87 211	That is a field of wheat.
211	178 106 175 113 108 96 26 7 6 199 211	roar and make your self look big.
211	178 144 64 74 25 95 100 93 87 39 211	Most people are terrified about heights more so when flying on hot air ballons
211	90 101 11 145 102 198 44 14 38 99 211	Lots of blue in that sign there.
211	39 17 32 48 107 40 4 177 129 90 211	These flowers are average.
211	186 38 154 184 72 165 115 173 48 163 211	The horse and man are looking at each other in a resigned acceptance of the night's work.
211	110 42 212 2 151 117 175 210 213 19 211	He is swinging a club.
211	209 153 80 116 3 117 39 138 214 48 211	There are a lot of people wearing the same thing.
211	190 167 198 99 113 169 187 136 2 57 211	That's a lot of horses.
211	17 161 192 108 86 49 121 159 90 23 211	It's flat and gloomy.
211	23 197 106 188 148 41 170 92 209 56 211	Huh, Just some windows on a building.
211	123 130 56 105 179 63 62 44 86 92 211	This is just a bunch of dirt.
211	87 23 146 170 96 206 33 7 185 57 211	My 2 year old son could have made that
211	105 75 64 209 78 60 2 119 36 117 211	It was a rather boring lunch.
211	42 15 189 185 161 41 213 202 26 88 211	There are some people looking at the camera.
211	105 204 28 114 129 202 90 100 49 157 211	What dull photo of circles.
211	134 92 110 142 76 12 7 199 164 146 211	Did he enjoy it?
211	75 192 87 79 47 8 100 115 42 68 211	men at childrens' park.. they had to grow up
211	3 144 32 26 31 9 42 169 4 48 211	The whole picture is white
211	45 199 177 100 56 138 114 3 32 70 211	Is this a summer camp?
211	46 205 109 73 196 31 110 51 77 181 211	Very nice couple, with their rings.
211	152 77 142 31 9 213 24 44 28 23 211	The recipe for Starbucks in plane jane.
211	97 213 207 178 160 143 9 147 91 144 211	Dark blue isa clour
211	122 200 35 165 145 158 104 185 31 97 211	This thing doesn't even work.
211	67 162 65 198 132 51 119 39 2 199 211	Black and white is my favorite color.
211	153 97 74 39 187 83 94 161 135 109 211	Is that structural?
211	58 178 48 195 119 94 88 154 75 130 211	I think they all shop at the same store.
211	49 98 145 178 210 77 169 117 2 13 211	Everything you're going to see on this boat, you can see in this picture.
211	172 28 154 19 94 157 64 87 57 174 211	Not much to look at.
211	40 204 47 26 27 189 51 179 176 95 211	These clouds remind me of Seattle
211	32 153 54 142 134 55 76 199 29 121 211	The man in red is attempting a basketball goal.
211	138 13 101 95 160 14 45 176 190 15 211	I took about seven photographs while I was here. Couldn't get one from this angle though.
211	100 160 27 153 84 20 23 151 42 127 211	I love the grays and blacks in this picture
211	159 158 177 140 189 50 15 174 94 64 211	Some of the more well known streets in New York.
211	164 70 173 155 73 185 100 141 199 197 211	Aircraft. I'm not sure what kind.
211	60 139 16 58 162 186 89 54 116 115 211	The floors are red and the walls are black and cream.
212	111 80 13 185 58 21 74 128 176 113 212	Pretty, pretty blooms.
212	184 50 121 171 86 113 215 109 20 114 212	About last night.
212	80 140 131 41 48 110 105 161 58 71 212	I wonder if that grass under the tree ever realize how lucky they are to be shaded from the sun...
212	32 60 153 168 209 64 16 84 182 23 212	Looks like a fun vehicle for a man about town, such as myself.
212	26 60 73 137 152 116 128 19 147 206 212	What a fun park to visit!
212	73 150 202 104 184 188 186 103 144 187 212	The view is very casual
212	16 84 145 11 180 1 131 211 79 32 212	patterns in the architecture is interesting
212	71 106 155 48 21 17 168 181 175 9 212	A light summer day calls for touring the city.
212	204 26 31 51 123 30 76 151 192 101 212	I hope you’re picking a winner!

212	137 112 62 78 187 144 174 22 104 30 212	Hey buddy I like your shirt
212	142 58 207 183 143 19 56 190 29 99 212	Whoa, from this angle it hurts my neck to even look at this picture!
212	208 70 88 40 143 34 126 5 203 45 212	Who can the couple be ? who cares
212	116 29 30 101 78 96 205 79 133 89 212	you are not an eagle
212	52 107 170 145 151 171 169 209 90 29 212	I wonder if they are going to break out their latest hip hop dance moves.
212	172 188 168 163 107 198 93 117 72 128 212	This is the kind of painting lots of people have in their house.
212	66 108 10 37 189 61 140 205 200 94 212	This home is definitely livable.
212	77 49 84 11 114 59 175 179 96 129 212	Like are they a militia?
212	158 60 156 146 155 95 28 24 89 148 212	This show is awesome, lets buy some popcorn!
212	52 12 71 154 173 76 23 214 110 121 212	Does that cup have coffee or tea?
212	210 166 112 44 105 162 125 12 128 144 212	ITs a average auto place on some random road
212	140 88 58 83 29 150 16 164 12 99 212	Not the most pleasant place to meet up with someone.
212	10 179 81 124 64 152 119 32 184 47 212	I think it would be fun to hit all of those nails in.
212	196 6 58 181 42 50 28 80 96 97 212	Would like to take a stroll here
212	73 137 33 197 56 165 201 196 93 211 212	That food smells good!
212	211 78 13 98 188 42 91 149 82 165 212	the business is closed today
212	173 135 121 170 182 74 191 17 78 122 212	He's doing pretty well.
212	148 181 84 12 38 149 193 104 165 75 212	I'm about to go chill by the waterfall.
212	61 198 100 89 171 213 127 107 168 31 212	Cool place to hang and read a book I bet
212	190 32 160 193 29 214 80 131 57 166 212	Oh wow look on the back of that thing.
212	154 115 138 108 104 165 109 193 161 23 212	this picture is mother and dauther some like video
212	105 215 34 190 128 97 157 195 92 180 212	Nice sweat there
212	36 211 67 181 172 199 213 49 91 110 212	I'll be the punk who gets drunk tonight.
212	125 206 197 101 97 23 143 138 147 210 212	These colours look nice together
212	68 7 115 23 173 178 160 163 136 120 212	At the end of the day, there is nothing like sitting by the fire.
212	47 189 88 19 85 133 186 97 177 50 212	This is where the Hole in the Wall Gang got its start.
212	119 85 203 161 131 126 153 208 69 197 212	Just spying on a kid's birthday, don't mind me.
212	134 121 209 152 50 168 142 64 109 105 212	Beautiful sunny day...
212	78 100 177 193 121 190 207 51 27 6 212	Lets spend the day following that rainbow.
212	46 147 76 30 144 38 33 199 77 84 212	This looks like tons of fun! I want to join next time!
212	211 184 128 20 186 28 170 208 163 7 212	What a peaceful view.
212	89 102 15 14 210 173 165 60 192 5 212	Two funny old ladies, the remind me of my relatives.
212	6 119 34 131 46 73 88 13 49 78 212	That's what they think, but they're only guessing.
212	35 152 205 54 40 89 167 144 182 102 212	I love all the pretty blue and purple lights.
212	101 111 161 181 97 191 178 187 109 44 212	They look like they're having a fun time.
213	94 116 207 155 101 56 186 180 17 5 213	What kind of mold is that growing?
213	211 52 192 5 196 112 203 77 101 167 213	I hated this show.
213	171 103 14 111 13 65 201 172 210 197 213	Get off my beach right now!
213	144 48 45 184 47 76 135 72 6 97 213	what is the guy in the blue shirt looking at?
213	47 104 17 211 16 201 111 14 198 159 213	I'm lost and going to die!
213	32 108 114 62 107 211 189 19 160 209 213	Even he looks like he doesn't like the joke he just told...
213	144 36 158 109 175 188 110 105 180 99 213	I find it very interrupting to see the sidewalk not open to the village
213	61 49 48 80 115 69 30 154 51 2 213	I don't like this color
213	99 64 65 152 211 207 68 137 172 159 213	Seeing this makes me worry
213	207 193 104 32 114 202 71 99 156 87 213	These men are heading towards their dark ends.
213	161 132 78 4 206 44 77 95 109 215 213	The men are very freaky to me
213	44 46 157 99 11 185 171 115 79 194 213	The fish is freightful
213	188 78 70 151 91 205 125 145 106 39 213	Those men don't belong in that sports bar. They should get out.
213	81 16 8 211 71 54 65 86 43 188 213	Am I the only one that sees a messy house.
213	26 61 30 42 95 178 188 158 186 127 213	quesadilla explosion on the menu, has this been predigested
213	29 61 134 24 44 179 70 187 62 2 213	Pesticide use is the only thing we can thank for this flower being so pretty.
213	165 178 97 55 80 150 196 88 38 200 213	I never recyle.
213	14 124 178 64 61 13 155 142 35 147 213	That rack in the middle looks like it was used to torture people.
213	164 170 191 42 45 132 190 53 33 189 213	I once saw one of these floating around my room.
213	8 72 144 162 37 116 31 123 84 15 213	This stuffed animal needs to be sanitized.
213	127 90 115 112 47 66 204 54 30 189 213	Only bad mothers post their children on social media
213	138 60 51 1 53 105 160 192 88 111 213	This will flair up my allergies.
213	59 88 147 115 32 70 164 201 167 29 213	It would be annoying if the atv fell apart
213	57 71 78 181 70 63 35 202 102 199 213	Well they will all look like that when they are dead.
213	63 144 34 88 204 132 143 58 29 90 213	I wonder what would happen if all these people died right now.
213	28 7 43 11 179 88 149 121 5 107 213	A nice night, but they aren't aware of who could be watching them . . .
213	212 64 188 118 99 7 171 10 85 93 213	This looks like a house of great pain and suffering. How wonderful!
213	205 176 17 82 30 57 124 191 76 6 213	I hope they don't collide
213	141 168 200 75 37 68 147 175 161 182 213	This blue painting makes me want to slap you.
213	149 63 61 118 4 158 211 69 177 172 213	What a horrible sculpture. I want  to take it down.
213	171 182 63 127 169 85 97 178 66 12 213	I hate flowers
213	161 64 174 197 176 17 42 164 128 195 213	This fellow looks like a serial killer.
213	171 14 181 148 156 191 139 146 63 85 213	He seems to be good at biking, but his friend may get lost.
213	181 173 79 125 161 96 109 39 68 177 213	I hate to be the bearer of bad news but those markings definitely come from extraterrestrials who are trying to give us a dire message about our future.
213	72 52 102 99 75 101 179 31 106 196 213	This bunny with 4 eyes looks like it came straight from a horror movie.
213	163 193 124 154 9 105 125 26 40 106 213	Oh nice, I can do all kinds of naughty things in there !
213	45 122 64 19 18 150 34 15 113 61 213	This is a type of club random people start shooting in.
213	78 172 30 151 170 118 180 197 19 61 213	I'm never happy to see the return of the squirrels as they often eat my veggie patch.
213	171 19 65 5 206 67 55 211 70 30 213	That is the most disgusting pond I have ever seen, who knows what kind of homicidal creatures lurk underneath the water.
213	51 111 66 42 54 132 185 16 32 59 213	"Relations" with animals is still technically legal in many US states.
213	126 186 15 86 22 135 76 65 154 109 213	She looks like she's up to no good at all.
213	120 108 168 25 54 198 103 89 83 172 213	There must be trouble lurking beneath the dark waters.
213	154 169 70 173 57 56 79 103 145 186 213	rugby in england get ugly
213	110 15 132 190 25 197 94 196 80 89 213	What a bad display of greenery.
213	149 172 54 121 119 47 185 108 163 17 213	Looks like some art someone in prison made!
213	35 49 100 27 85 136 108 65 202 1 213	CLOWNS!!!! Run away!
213	90 204 195 121 164 140 81 58 31 184 213	That smoke looks odd
213	162 191 134 159 182 79 47 194 53 138 213	this is disturbing haha
213	173 151 43 80 10 64 24 197 51 155 213	That building looks abandoned and perhaps haunted.
213	158 144 73 5 161 201 9 136 15 190 213	This is Bud Light ad is bizarre for a funeral.
213	1 37 129 112 61 145 162 7 55 87 213	I know that someone, looking at this picture, is trying to look down that shirt!
213	202 32 147 175 42 113 140 59 123 114 213	Sometimes its irritating to see some buildings!
213	20 149 189 123 46 139 45 82 23 143 213	I think they might find a body soon.
213	136 44 135 169 155 81 197 21 170 13 213	I think she has extra fingers.
213	76 185 40 149 206 94 34 83 61 23 213	That water looks like raw sewage.
213	78 95 38 77 90 114 131 202 149 207 213	I bet everyone in this picture is no longer living.
213	27 208 71 144 93 32 103 7 63 160 213	Were these used for water torture in the olden days?
213	59 48 124 110 116 180 176 212 25 86 213	Seems like a great place to leave a body
213	57 204 90 199 67 135 133 73 18 1 213	Is that kid alive?
213	71 10 29 139 152 115 143 81 202 123 213	That kid looks like he's about to do something absolutely terrible to that bottle.
213	150 177 51 169 89 208 61 32 163 42 213	We shouldn't treat horses like that
213	211 202 79 82 154 142 127 99 36 112 213	That red sock makes the leg appear as if it is a bloody mess.
213	65 167 31 105 123 37 160 27 16 79 213	This is the color of blood in the veins, but when you cut someone open it turns red.
213	119 198 129 145 82 140 6 172 54 33 213	That fawn would cook up great on my grill!
213	208 16 90 194 112 32 13 53 121 140 213	I wonder how much longer it will take until these breads grow mold. I would laugh if the merchant did not notice the mold and then sold it to the customer.
213	80 151 68 195 126 211 190 52 121 191 213	that is where that deadly crash was
213	146 197 132 47 73 137 193 161 173 71 213	This image reminds me of a chase-scene in a horror film.
213	128 96 180 36 147 201 46 211 188 3 213	This photo is a reminder that we will all eventually die or become poor.
213	48 66 173 9 167 67 110 147 54 195 213	i hope he crashes
213	197 175 178 5 76 68 120 7 165 95 213	I want people to see me screaming in terror here.
213	27 119 59 122 83 25 63 94 156 133 213	I hope one spouse doesn't attempt to murder the other
213	116 196 42 113 48 91 140 14 174 43 213	What is that thing?
213	95 27 154 172 41 88 45 180 153 210 213	He looks pretty annoyed.
213	42 163 145 200 131 205 108 27 124 129 213	There is a body buried in the sand.
213	183 95 42 32 105 176 180 71 8 121 213	i dont like how this looks
213	209 91 110 104 201 166 43 132 172 140 213	Pink is the color of flesh.
213	164 54 146 185 81 104 120 75 58 31 213	I am so troubled that some of the wood fell of the rack, which may mean every piece falls off, possibly into the ocean.
213	69 166 44 136 33 151 187 120 200 165 213	Someone is going to slip and break an ankle in the game.
213	69 172 161 37 204 187 146 201 57 7 213	Empty like my heart
213	42 166 197 74 17 149 12 125 207 192 213	And once again evil baby will rule the world muuuhahahahah
213	79 170 73 160 132 57 6 22 114 149 213	I could peer through these bushes.
213	32 142 67 18 164 211 200 90 24 35 213	That guys shirt is a perfect target for my new spear
213	22 63 42 202 28 178 211 149 184 56 213	It'd be funny to put some animals in that cage and watch them fight to the death.
213	135 114 191 91 27 40 129 202 140 112 213	No idea what to call this, but the image is unsettling.
213	104 108 14 215 187 198 184 54 4 188 213	I cannot imagine what the shrimp must have felt when it was cooked alive.
213	205 143 182 185 209 33 114 84 125 138 213	I hope everyone at this concert gets the chicken pox.
213	97 178 28 204 84 210 80 74 165 48 213	What if she was a dude once.
213	214 165 72 31 67 58 161 47 1 94 213	I wish I was there to bring up questions on why our school system and roads are so bad. I would of grilled them all.
213	140 158 115 22 98 69 176 188 14 184 213	These comment section makes me feel sick of people's ignorance
213	138 111 147 13 39 28 130 102 36 14 213	Sponge Bob is trapped inside of the dune.
213	120 146 157 169 54 43 145 147 61 150 213	I just watched him hit his wife!
213	151 45 164 118 199 150 64 172 46 61 213	Looks like a bacteria infection in the sand.
213	29 42 40 85 23 136 57 191 82 215 213	What king of new dance moves are these? I like your shirt :)
213	12 132 53 43 152 197 56 172 146 49 213	This is where I take my victims, the basement from the old abandoned house.
213	137 113 189 39 166 155 37 73 127 55 213	Those look like airplane seats that are outdoors.
213	104 148 18 125 128 44 155 157 96 38 213	The area looks like it might harbor a murder who keeps the heads of his victims in the nearby fountain and talks to them at night.
213	117 5 212 142 18 139 164 49 101 77 213	The marshals office also served as a makeshift gallows
213	59 153 187 96 178 113 30 210 35 17 213	The seconds before the Lombardi trophy was used in a grisly murder
213	109 148 157 106 174 209 202 102 179 31 213	If only I had 2 or 3 heads so I could always watch everything around me
213	28 187 141 33 106 178 42 203 39 204 213	The building block out all of the sunlight.
213	134 9 63 115 202 56 108 50 95 167 213	why does the sun have to set in the west
213	139 120 200 84 208 18 60 68 53 17 213	I'd love to rub this flower up and down my flesh.
213	119 181 189 24 12 208 91 86 22 173 213	Look at all those dead things
213	7 89 21 41 14 201 5 102 141 15 213	I want to push him down!
213	60 212 82 59 137 125 32 171 196 67 213	hopefully no school shooters are there
213	25 149 133 2 20 96 212 180 51 177 213	I wonder if those baloons are filled with pigs intestines.
213	112 146 135 38 183 31 127 97 5 143 213	Imagine all of the dead bodies that could be thrown in that forest.
213	187 201 177 40 45 143 131 142 129 157 213	What monsters does the woods hide at night?
213	84 53 15 54 39 78 17 192 183 178 213	She looks as if she just committed several murders
213	105 159 76 101 174 164 73 42 123 162 213	These flowers should die!
213	125 89 150 166 50 59 69 177 85 164 213	That park would be very dark at night. I like that.
213	176 167 81 93 141 199 148 152 206 205 213	The train tunnel of death. Many trains go in, but none come out.
213	206 198 14 147 44 208 137 106 115 8 213	This baby has evil eyes.
213	166 79 195 204 31 14 2 163 160 184 213	I wish I was in between them...
213	109 7 162 30 211 203 174 134 6 71 213	Imagine the cuel way they must have brutally slaughtered those chickens.
213	157 144 190 133 199 208 107 40 126 59 213	This crack looks very similar to the gash I have in my chest right now.
213	80 137 15 89 122 145 126 179 2 144 213	I couldn't force myself to care about this.
213	71 164 49 167 183 112 86 141 109 187 213	After this moment was captured, the couple were caught by a rip tide and drowned at sea.
213	183 7 108 51 97 43 173 90 24 175 213	I bet it would hurt if you jumped off.
213	199 153 85 78 2 48 168 195 69 93 213	I wonder how much money it cost for that bridge and how many mouths that money could have fed.
213	11 151 115 128 110 193 165 82 198 36 213	This guy is recording my hidden thoughts!
213	177 1 29 126 68 98 14 120 6 117 213	He will be dead soon.
213	74 207 119 81 114 195 29 55 164 112 213	This was the last time he was seen alive.
213	43 53 106 194 158 211 30 71 111 131 213	It would be terrible if that tree fell and crushed the pedestrians below
213	35 144 15 151 76 34 118 171 72 8 213	This is the last photo ever of the gentleman in the orange shirt.
213	68 36 157 156 15 199 93 37 33 172 213	Is that written in blood that has dried up now? What the hell, I couldn't get so near to that!
213	201 200 108 147 87 203 208 12 179 126 213	This church has a troubled violent past.
213	175 132 34 60 75 173 142 42 138 204 213	The woods are home to many scary animals.  I know someone who was once mauled by a grizzly bear.
213	121 126 171 80 161 97 103 134 176 118 213	I think this ship sank not too longer after this picture was taken.
213	72 87 162 136 153 215 73 44 152 147 213	I can't believe so many people within the city live below the poverty line.
213	111 12 26 208 202 174 44 160 152 75 213	It's anime oh my.
213	209 92 178 134 82 177 36 14 48 128 213	This girl is running away after killing someone.
213	99 33 86 48 109 209 43 171 71 19 213	Yuk! green water, i moean what else do we need, frogs?
213	196 81 87 43 174 86 186 48 58 175 213	These divers are in the mix of all these dangerous fish and are taking a big risk.
213	202 55 204 193 212 75 136 95 86 183 213	I cannot imagine how creepy it must be there.
213	210 92 121 75 157 68 185 55 189 38 213	Imagine if that jet just fell out of the sky and landed on someones head.
213	73 131 62 146 115 123 102 71 204 75 213	I want to burn this flag
213	127 38 144 205 48 129 139 110 121 18 213	I did this before, but my opponent isn't alive to confirm.
213	181 10 151 121 77 71 39 107 48 89 213	I wonder if he is going to kidnap someone.
213	150 153 140 34 200 78 186 184 106 29 213	We should banish all art and live in the dark.
213	173 164 60 114 55 200 35 53 195 104 213	She is about to have a heart attack.
213	52 211 85 66 189 130 62 19 41 182 213	Help I can't get out
213	142 192 3 176 108 194 112 152 75 63 213	Nobody ever goes here
213	64 190 208 126 168 49 70 41 59 99 213	They look like tiny knives
213	74 194 195 175 107 203 174 94 75 60 213	Should green make me feel so angry?
213	92 103 206 107 19 193 147 188 200 52 213	What if this thing snapped?
213	115 192 123 77 170 50 162 121 37 87 213	That red leaf is actually thought to be a sign that a death is about to occur nearby in some folktales.
213	142 19 42 9 5 163 82 110 151 29 213	He looks like a serial killer, which I think is rad.
213	149 196 162 169 147 38 127 116 82 140 213	nobody is not disturf to everybody
213	165 90 20 139 44 137 79 211 63 154 213	Being quiet worries me more!
213	27 186 77 142 165 63 114 133 120 175 213	Is this a picture of a ghost?
213	51 102 187 92 101 132 161 64 35 73 213	This cat might get hit by the window above!
213	38 42 6 16 97 210 98 212 196 211 213	Is this the green screen image of death.
213	41 58 16 57 20 28 128 85 173 166 213	The color of moose intestines, what great times.
213	4 211 137 98 158 171 15 41 24 39 213	No parking? I'd drive my car right into the wall just to show the Man that I park where I want.
213	46 173 137 90 195 27 35 115 198 39 213	I wonder how many bodies have been dumped in this area...
213	137 59 115 174 125 68 64 55 165 198 213	This statue is haunted.
213	178 207 165 191 147 205 10 97 179 44 213	You are doomed to fail and the Blue Jays are a subpar baseball team.
213	39 181 10 185 72 19 82 214 104 34 213	I hope he drowns his sorrows in that beer.
213	188 189 2 20 75 34 139 206 131 101 213	I do not know why anyone would put a Christmas tree on the beach.
213	153 158 29 124 112 62 9 133 21 113 213	This this is so old that it could crash and leave you dead on the side of the road.
213	174 99 142 147 101 53 80 195 211 148 213	The drawing is like a horror movie!
213	115 15 8 165 41 14 16 179 12 148 213	Who would ever put a trash can in the shower?
213	152 90 200 192 191 210 24 62 72 63 213	This looks like mold which could cause cancer.
213	90 129 177 2 115 47 165 103 70 69 213	She is not going to make it in time, and probably fail this competition
213	178 62 14 127 209 99 132 131 69 129 213	Looks like the two girls are wearing some funny hats.
213	196 155 82 163 63 19 191 50 141 48 213	I hope she's looking at grapes for a snack, she needs to eat.
213	209 52 132 6 135 78 93 141 112 71 213	she's pregnant wearing tight clothing
213	23 37 178 186 42 124 198 91 44 190 213	there looks like theres blood on the floor behind her
213	211 190 156 139 19 62 49 142 120 201 213	They're following us!
213	162 34 45 147 38 176 155 197 70 175 213	Someone died in that house.
213	7 100 136 133 2 169 187 64 45 66 213	What a beautiful place, perfect for hunting humans.
213	3 19 87 154 60 2 142 153 178 21 213	I wouldn't get too close...they could be human eating plants!
213	192 75 61 178 47 88 139 165 191 147 213	These mountains have many mysteries of children disappearing over the years.
213	211 40 102 112 35 69 7 5 193 177 213	I wonder if this temple used to be used to make sacrifices to the gods? Want to go to the top and find out, and I'll kick you off of it!
213	73 50 161 78 138 162 100 79 209 45 213	I bet a murder took place in this room at some time.
213	148 104 188 70 91 14 205 185 200 199 213	I bet they are going to smack each one of their butts.
213	78 64 138 163 168 1 67 24 182 43 213	Just imagine...They parked here after the flood.
213	114 127 68 209 18 2 87 77 19 89 213	It looks like the Alamo burned down.
213	43 82 184 29 178 96 26 40 187 80 213	We're robbing this place tonight.
213	198 118 110 193 22 145 139 14 23 170 213	Looks like a monster from my dreams
213	156 31 187 155 128 183 133 56 158 32 213	I knew a guy that got hit like that in football. Knocked a blood clot loose and killed him on the spot.
213	143 125 199 124 5 61 45 24 206 79 213	There once was a homeless guy that passed out drunk on some train tracks like these, away from a station where they don't have to blow their horns.
213	141 97 179 93 45 165 124 172 198 107 213	Clones at play.
213	143 13 182 53 39 187 28 77 192 212 213	I heard they were using live baby birds for bait.
213	94 26 85 121 119 65 88 71 43 109 213	You know that water is absolutely FILLED with brain eating bacteria, how gross.
213	15 129 141 29 81 143 14 48 203 25 213	It would be nice to take a match and light a fire to the drum set and roast marshmallows.
213	214 193 48 138 171 18 158 119 20 88 213	I've got some ideas for those people, but I probably shouldn't talk about them ...
214	186 73 193 6 47 12 165 93 87 157 214	This looks like a fun comedy show, i'd sure go.
214	54 47 210 168 67 135 6 94 78 212 214	I find it hillarious when the girl wears funny clothes
214	142 122 7 46 72 80 133 19 152 76 214	The number 14 is hilarious to me
214	166 180 90 8 116 26 29 133 60 79 214	What an awesome looking trail dude!
214	98 88 61 165 161 193 130 89 162 24 214	It is funny how people like the bus
214	210 206 2 114 60 119 199 105 197 34 214	Let's chum the waters!, jokinggg
214	124 57 32 81 49 212 135 127 199 190 214	How cute. French.
214	154 5 204 196 157 100 59 140 4 83 214	How funny are these hills, I bet they have all kinda of crazy holes and animals there.
214	204 48 85 157 127 131 130 15 97 68 214	cloudy, city, calm
214	201 168 169 141 211 15 157 137 132 52 214	He has such a silly, funny face!
214	42 173 65 74 114 91 44 126 30 12 214	Wow, look at that iceberg. Hopefully the ship steers clear!
214	89 53 152 46 172 38 190 157 68 205 214	That looks like something my dog spat up.
214	178 24 79 144 93 117 207 67 173 212 214	This is seriously way cool.
214	191 167 172 54 90 36 58 140 66 200 214	It really does look like a dead bug.
214	151 57 202 109 189 67 164 184 44 119 214	swim that river!
214	107 97 74 168 125 2 67 185 37 200 214	There's nothing more exhilarating than rushing down level 4 rapids during summer.
214	72 149 178 195 15 168 12 53 143 130 214	I miss a good sausage!
214	77 119 138 193 205 100 149 68 94 202 214	a combination of qualities, such as shape, colour, person  holding nature.
214	21 43 50 151 141 8 159 156 115 92 214	It makes me happy to see all the bikes
214	35 72 85 213 191 83 206 36 134 8 214	The shelves were filled with enthralling books
214	39 62 66 183 86 48 5 175 164 107 214	Haha I wonder if he will disappear in thie phone booth!
214	195 66 149 27 213 40 144 117 1 74 214	I love watching this guy give speeches.  He is an amazing speaker, and has many good things to say.
214	118 38 35 136 191 52 174 178 58 208 214	I finished tons of things, one was not work.
214	86 145 92 127 34 129 194 164 53 1 214	It was hilarious when I had to run to the bathroom after drink all threes drinks plus a glass of water.
214	80 1 43 155 190 93 85 186 201 20 214	Need a little entertainment?
214	41 168 120 191 211 146 124 210 75 96 214	I always love watching a passionate crowd.
214	61 123 19 128 36 124 100 22 68 167 214	Look at these cretins! Stuck in their rat-race, I bet they think they're going somewhere!
214	211 70 6 40 48 152 112 184 206 209 214	Her outfit matches the runway.
214	189 75 145 100 103 196 173 114 180 111 214	Haha I bet they are having a wonderful time fishing on the river! I guess you could say they are in their natural habitat!
214	135 85 117 126 89 2 65 175 165 90 214	Yeah, obviously. Thanks.
214	67 73 133 59 118 165 90 9 164 70 214	Purple, just like my favorite dinosaur!
214	141 79 106 49 137 202 160 114 40 4 214	He's walking away fast, wants to go eat!
214	146 116 122 67 176 20 183 18 66 178 214	If this were Grand Theft Auto, I'd grab that thing and make it FLY!
214	139 152 148 64 52 27 188 154 134 73 214	Wow I never knew mother's milk taste like that.
214	43 181 51 141 112 44 215 123 13 184 214	The fish are majestically swimming in their natural habitat.
214	121 25 105 176 112 1 190 174 45 63 214	Its always such a joy to go out and cut down your own tree in the snow.
214	110 192 32 9 203 53 207 20 92 24 214	risque night out
214	32 68 90 44 78 87 168 74 88 93 214	lets see if the music lessons works
214	155 42 83 52 62 164 5 71 180 6 214	Those look like giant sandals.
214	174 62 61 15 100 58 65 32 49 55 214	Is that a tennis ball?  Time to serve it.
214	103 24 139 188 187 215 62 64 143 191 214	The room is full of chairs
214	49 168 134 43 135 204 144 187 2 110 214	nice looking weeds
214	172 118 39 47 132 59 103 77 145 150 214	Do you think they would let me join?
214	131 160 187 90 211 200 144 51 33 178 214	I didn't realize that her shirt was her shirt... I thought it was her skin at first! lol!
214	99 53 80 146 171 82 55 31 10 128 214	what is this?
214	150 65 85 88 156 33 60 105 140 56 214	I would love to run that trail
214	33 78 205 25 69 11 34 74 129 31 214	That dog shouldn't be there.
214	212 168 74 170 165 146 112 50 94 131 214	These are some funny looking people.
214	97 113 115 24 105 205 111 128 135 84 214	I didn't know that lobster claws grew on trees!
214	171 202 78 151 165 94 161 166 58 79 214	Where's Bob Ross? This is a happy little bush.
214	148 30 176 35 36 159 82 103 49 50 214	I could not wait to get here and try all of the rides.
214	28 156 114 202 100 209 94 185 11 129 214	I am curious what is in the basket.
214	37 135 85 96 82 61 106 92 192 67 214	Great family photo, but they need some Santa decoration in there!
214	139 46 98 170 87 205 94 116 68 1 214	Snow for me to play on
214	31 192 171 1 4 11 166 207 108 2 214	Waving flags around is one of the most fun things to do.
214	132 55 175 6 204 58 114 98 199 161 214	Woman finding here way to a new style.

215	119 5 186 184 144 131 110 92 60 125 215	It is unclear what the man is doing
215	72 34 69 197 146 179 195 73 205 92 215	Three men and a idiot baby.

215	137 56 138 196 165 101 156 97 68 94 215	That path looks brilliant to ride on, I wish I was there rather than at work!
215	174 50 141 138 194 68 47 178 126 58 215	Dream vacation to the shore

215	155 8 178 39 191 130 60 194 20 158 215	One day I hope I can live a life similar to this with land of my own.
215	50 65 21 87 73 16 180 197 53 72 215	This reminds me of Harry Potter... I wish this train went to Hogwarts.

215	48 13 208 157 187 137 151 141 185 59 215	This looks very mystical.
215	72 103 59 76 3 122 33 118 4 71 215	I'd like to leave work and drive this road.
215	158 194 108 54 169 214 18 78 180 114 215	This place seems so interesting,I bet there are many fun happenings.

215	123 61 87 133 17 135 81 74 174 64 215	The way the light filters and bounces through this window has me mezmorized.
215	72 128 96 85 195 67 200 125 105 143 215	I have yet to attend a concert and I am 43 years old.

215	37 149 85 50 80 43 161 32 155 58 215	It must be really nice and beautiful to live in such a great apartment building downtown.
215	17 185 167 34 64 165 20 152 91 104 215	Wow! I just love this place. I would love to sit on a blanket and relax with a good book in hand.
215	199 113 179 58 51 97 78 4 65 117 215	This photo looks like a perfect night with the lovebug.
215	164 172 189 98 197 37 32 192 52 1 215	If only I were laying in Hawaii soaking in the sun and scenery.
215	173 143 141 26 91 186 36 75 99 116 215	Just imagine the stars in this place when it's completely dark!
215	192 4 36 155 110 71 134 55 204 68 215	I can only imagine having a fraction of that door.
215	199 166 114 179 104 30 112 85 133 169 215	Reminds me of Christmas
215	18 172 121 160 50 44 155 169 125 133 215	Reminds me of traveling the world, through Europe and South America.
215	151 156 84 163 171 170 68 92 178 197 215	These women look prepared for a very special event. One that you do not get to experience many times in your life.
215	120 195 205 90 13 83 176 14 82 46 215	He would be a perfect husband.
215	25 97 197 49 46 168 157 51 35 182 215	I wish I could have the life of a monkey hanging in trees.

215	77 80 141 200 61 186 42 160 48 66 215	What could be in there
215	170 119 9 47 17 44 50 59 69 132 215	Your shadow looks like it has a mind of its own.
215	174 151 89 183 162 123 58 22 156 6 215	Wow. Every time they play any song with fireworks, I'm getting all misty.
215	185 80 49 85 15 192 159 77 27 40 215	A unperfect click
215	49 176 71 56 1 76 137 200 33 184 215	I would love to swim with the dolphins.
215	92 42 41 58 149 214 208 190 153 37 215	The mountains and water call to mind fantasies of campfires, stories and marshmallows.
215	99 13 101 128 19 193 51 26 9 98 215	This pole looks like it could go on forever upward. I wonder if you could climb it to the moon
215	205 174 18 16 43 119 134 160 180 54 215	This looks like something I'd want to paint.
215	64 189 106 132 149 16 1 47 103 53 215	this is a book like scene with the boats floating across the vast curtain of the sea.
215	134 179 65 177 119 205 49 163 168 156 215	I can imagine what they are saying.

215	92 32 67 188 98 18 102 126 4 66 215	What a beautiful family! Their smiles show just how relaxing a vacation can be.
215	69 197 143 109 128 158 87 31 191 79 215	It shows a much older, much simpler times...

215	144 165 151 112 69 175 3 114 39 27 215	I wish I could live there.
215	36 87 213 132 26 5 13 17 99 210 215	I really want to wake up to that..
215	135 164 39 148 144 200 58 3 130 38 215	I wish I could flash back to the time in this monument.
215	82 52 85 62 23 140 203 17 67 211 215	I wish I could taste that melt-on-your-tongue ice cream! I bet the cookies are soft and delicious!
215	214 25 77 139 45 174 52 211 2 192 215	Having this system would bring so much joy to my life.

215	178 173 117 167 32 201 190 139 180 75 215	I would love to lay out a towel and look up at the clouds with a sweet person.
215	94 211 203 53 65 187 196 4 50 212 215	Wow this would be amazing to look at as a study break!

215	48 95 6 173 155 86 58 74 149 106 215	I think of a time with better conditions for all.
215	210 107 129 72 61 190 35 31 102 41 215	Warm, sunny day and the sound of water lapping on the sides. I am in love with this!
