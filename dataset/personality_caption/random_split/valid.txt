4	176 108 162 180 114 54 147 135 19 34 4	What is that!? WORMS!?
4	111 192 93 24 191 17 129 80 165 207 4	that guy looks like he is going so fast
4	116 159 154 44 167 131 177 51 214 109 4	These tiny men love to show off their matchbox cars.
4	96 41 149 192 197 154 204 189 172 132 4	At peace in the throne!
4	198 79 136 149 213 151 34 188 19 63 4	He is looking crazy!
4	113 33 205 130 59 199 204 3 44 131 4	look at that jump my goooooood
4	215 139 63 50 66 38 19 54 52 124 4	What a crazy rule, that you can't water the flowers.
4	62 90 9 127 151 94 213 163 53 116 4	Wow the sleek and slender iphone look great!
4	16 35 127 147 84 51 160 61 151 149 4	Look at the awesome face this tower is making! Heheehehe.
4	102 170 58 60 13 186 22 69 179 192 4	You go girl, flaunt it like you've got it! Love the confident strut.
4	185 211 83 99 170 198 148 116 84 146 4	Time to race these!! Lol.  Hope some fun music is being played.  And games... lots of games.
4	200 210 86 192 171 124 198 142 134 113 4	The light is reflecting weird off the greens.
4	171 53 77 83 8 49 174 200 31 43 4	He looks like he’s trying to come to life and escape!!
4	64 22 145 116 95 71 195 31 113 18 4	What a silly game, are they on the same team or not!
4	78 150 158 60 79 26 173 75 171 166 4	Pete is so random
4	47 49 148 50 185 77 34 189 136 46 4	Doesn't this view just want to make you climb to the very top and roll all the way down? Who's with me?!
4	38 201 104 67 208 190 70 183 144 182 4	Hot dog! That is the best sunset I ever did see if I do say so myself!
4	108 115 205 157 2 104 12 191 31 47 4	My dog is nuts! She'll run in circles all day long until she just falls over. Thank goodness my neighbors dog will distract her sometimes.
4	82 11 13 72 157 56 175 212 177 67 4	I drew that myself
4	142 91 20 194 215 214 10 206 57 189 4	I bet if you dare me I would stay the night here.
4	91 97 192 202 5 61 188 155 181 147 4	Up and down the beach, run run run!
4	154 125 127 163 149 170 115 47 139 212 4	Fuzzball s t a r e s !
4	108 213 191 179 159 209 155 42 91 175 4	Night Starry That On Green And Wires All Was It
4	125 22 26 3 40 135 156 34 134 47 4	This is the silliest picture of the wackiest food!
4	187 202 21 35 67 79 69 173 101 204 4	zeeeonk! This is crazy stuff!
4	90 117 43 95 122 201 55 113 187 139 4	Oh wow, i would love to go watch this with a bunch of girls , the perfect anti date
4	74 145 121 131 144 207 172 161 25 117 4	I don't understand this photo.
4	168 120 111 23 112 143 162 140 71 200 4	I wrap myself in the lights before turning them on.
4	163 215 182 194 41 160 195 103 124 159 4	A blurry picture of a rooftop, and I am there as a woodpecker, knocking my noggin for grub.
4	146 175 49 167 13 162 116 56 157 185 4	Everybody, lets Zingo!!!
4	123 66 199 45 97 204 48 87 202 54 4	*laughs* look at this dude
4	31 19 185 155 190 180 20 151 179 133 4	We should scramble all the buttons on the machines and see what happens
4	87 75 31 23 206 41 208 17 169 149 4	wow, it is going to run!
4	104 5 158 152 146 3 142 171 24 105 4	Why does this baby have a fully grown adult's head?
4	2 106 41 169 143 88 58 182 201 83 4	Im an so confused
4	77 109 6 93 32 129 57 2 33 160 4	This game was a roller coaster! Very unconventional plays were performed.
4	123 69 213 106 209 144 78 93 62 140 4	The grainy aspect of this photo is the best thing since sliced bread
4	188 107 71 38 166 31 29 109 32 101 4	I am coming out of the tomb-- boo!
4	65 94 53 209 33 170 159 160 27 121 4	This man should dance to a polka for the crowd
4	62 191 39 146 119 19 28 34 120 9 4	Looks like a wild party those guys are having up there! Glad I'm in a crowd where we all know how to have a good time!
4	136 22 25 196 54 130 120 41 174 201 4	She is texting a picture of her uncle thumbing his nose at her.
4	109 203 161 108 128 41 211 23 193 111 4	Preaching to the choir?
4	200 176 95 107 88 112 134 12 10 126 4	Such a bright shade of yellow on a speedy little car like that! What fun would that be to drive it to the ice cream shop!
4	83 123 32 1 12 156 165 198 209 191 4	Those are either some giant people or some tiny statues!!!
4	61 13 43 129 49 125 136 60 161 178 4	The family is relaxing.
4	166 30 48 28 91 45 40 73 172 168 4	Those look like wigs flying in the wind!
4	154 141 5 202 151 22 20 138 168 169 4	Whoa this picture is wild!
4	75 89 115 90 48 188 19 37 119 191 4	Can you imagine parachuting off the top of that?!
4	111 167 51 2 197 164 212 131 13 56 4	The cookies look very strange.
4	73 40 6 5 131 123 23 84 148 191 4	I love to scream really loud when I taste something mildly declicious
4	35 120 188 209 14 131 138 158 152 10 4	Who doesn't love pitchforks and cast-iron pans for party decor.
4	81 215 206 183 62 39 19 134 69 181 4	I wonder if those will grow flowers.
4	106 7 170 101 182 98 75 125 104 25 4	That sand looks delicious
4	34 182 130 105 215 191 150 75 59 181 4	biggy and small
4	56 52 134 44 73 135 150 124 15 100 4	Looks as if he's going to be tied up in chains!
4	165 35 70 84 43 1 181 211 75 39 4	What a crazy little party, looks like fun!
4	203 174 127 191 23 137 122 189 60 81 4	How many AA batteries does that run on?
4	144 204 51 141 61 153 92 201 139 88 4	I love the dark perilous looking clouds.
4	179 143 3 123 215 132 136 156 160 157 4	Seriously not going on the roof
4	208 214 107 145 131 113 133 62 8 148 4	Seeing this green color made me think of green M&M's and using them to paint a canvas.
4	207 8 134 214 171 19 113 215 55 36 4	They always did things that was weird.
4	157 162 106 42 122 147 201 172 5 46 4	Wowww, these cars are such a sight to behold! Like a Sprite can colors!
4	100 202 64 183 212 71 31 173 132 197 4	This is how I look in the morning before getting ready
4	28 94 7 10 151 159 177 199 113 155 4	this picture is intersting
4	139 35 14 74 181 171 73 201 183 160 4	This color is crazy! It makes me think of wild all night parties!
4	178 98 157 154 74 101 53 213 135 125 4	Wowee, look! A wiggly squiggly cliff and some bumpity bumpity mountains and a swirly river!
4	8 75 19 140 1 116 202 45 172 36 4	It was obscure.
4	152 212 37 24 72 79 36 17 33 95 4	You should jump in the river and make some fish!
4	134 76 165 174 181 184 73 36 62 27 4	Are they getting divorced already?
4	213 176 127 120 99 45 210 48 189 173 4	Finally, a photo that's oriented to how I see things!
4	103 93 152 141 80 74 118 196 160 79 4	Spring afternoon day
4	83 215 150 140 194 90 13 68 98 47 4	yeah like we haven't all seen this image before
4	61 83 169 35 212 24 20 104 52 131 4	Run puppy, the elephants are coming!
4	164 68 71 158 154 186 147 204 182 66 4	The caption is so big
4	56 121 51 106 107 90 25 23 66 172 4	The colors of this fish would make for a great suit.
4	181 177 175 28 63 20 37 58 93 138 4	Where are the guardrails on these steps?!
4	124 193 25 122 44 169 171 7 20 168 4	I love side sun rooms, they are so rare, but I love them!
5	92 107 79 203 175 211 39 169 186 173 5	The baby isn't with her mom.
5	186 92 99 93 13 56 65 38 77 40 5	I deserve this view. I work harder than anyone else, I am glad my house is private.
5	23 192 62 176 205 178 8 45 153 183 5	This is just a blue box?
5	198 103 32 82 62 145 54 73 122 26 5	I would never visit such a depressing place.
5	213 173 9 160 153 212 164 142 145 115 5	I could climb to the top of that mast in no time flat.
5	212 122 125 12 202 48 58 142 126 211 5	This photo would be better with my boat in it, it's bigger.
5	32 107 73 12 212 113 45 137 92 6 5	Um I could dance better lol
5	110 59 127 117 208 204 171 182 177 162 5	I am the KING of the world!! Well, this airplane at least.
5	202 156 192 75 160 126 20 18 116 9 5	Even if there's two chairs I wouldn't share. I need one for a foot rest. My shoes cant be dirty.
5	34 36 61 192 186 92 146 131 40 204 5	Now i can plow this field and keep people out.
5	92 24 78 59 119 73 1 50 188 131 5	Why is his mouth like that it makes no sense.
5	151 109 146 36 73 42 181 100 64 11 5	I bet I could see my reflection in that water.
5	95 79 22 61 109 165 113 60 82 99 5	Selfies are the most narcissistic part of modern society.
5	166 133 100 65 87 196 207 146 109 69 5	I could have driven that car with the ball on it better than he did.
5	8 114 100 1 205 158 203 39 209 132 5	Like anyone needs woodpeckers.
5	162 21 204 77 55 85 174 16 83 114 5	I could hula hoop way better than this performer!
5	145 161 204 195 111 140 150 162 49 146 5	My baby is more beautiful when lying in a cradle
5	72 92 159 85 193 199 27 117 106 110 5	What a ditzy blonde. I'm sure I'm smarter than her.
5	45 84 177 193 160 118 127 120 26 114 5	I don't need to wear a helmet,I am a perfect driver
5	206 4 112 30 104 17 97 39 151 15 5	This city is mine!
5	70 39 128 87 95 175 100 14 198 188 5	That guy looks like a real baller.  Kinda reminds me of myself.
5	116 49 215 24 89 22 161 175 7 73 5	I have that same bathrobe, and I look way better.
5	139 129 168 123 61 170 134 207 27 4 5	I did all this work myself. No one helped me.
5	209 129 86 118 100 204 18 95 195 120 5	This is blurry, I would never do that.
5	20 57 136 81 8 163 123 19 12 139 5	I was the very best at Space Invaders in my youth.
5	14 184 13 135 123 30 189 95 196 148 5	We should post this photo on Facebook so all our friends can see us.
5	165 59 126 206 69 141 114 63 215 208 5	Honestly, I could do better and look better while wrestling. I know I could.
5	132 55 67 2 139 196 21 31 13 9 5	vain, self-loving, self-admiring
5	114 186 142 184 84 74 197 96 44 98 5	I don't like this as much as I like my photos.
5	50 211 77 99 197 6 129 98 164 97 5	The craft reminds me of all the times that I build wonderful sculptures.
5	203 34 104 170 151 42 208 177 31 111 5	I could be sitting on the Bench
5	179 214 110 182 193 152 191 174 105 65 5	Perfect place for my noisy neighbor to vacation at, away from my house.
5	36 65 212 174 32 194 93 21 206 74 5	I would have expected a better wig to go with that gorgeous top.
5	12 134 97 54 191 149 202 172 2 19 5	This color speaks only to, me
5	18 141 3 4 152 155 167 33 10 38 5	Art has gone down hill i swear! I could have made something ten times better with bottle caps and string! I am a true artist, these people are a joke.
5	74 211 189 96 47 204 171 92 164 99 5	This palace was built for me!
5	133 14 55 47 145 51 190 179 148 86 5	I could have done a better job of lifting the girl.
5	67 1 120 136 34 90 132 25 22 87 5	I know I could build a far better structure than that.
5	73 154 175 132 15 94 198 25 54 32 5	Why does anyone think these are beautiful. Just a slow, useless animal... except for getting in MY way.
5	58 175 154 108 104 128 158 103 167 171 5	None of these guys take as good as pictures as me.
5	105 41 75 190 166 170 48 83 128 133 5	This house is just too small for me to live in.
5	62 49 70 86 215 2 61 187 126 19 5	That train and the treeline is perfect for my boyfriend and I to enjoy.
5	145 36 175 2 27 124 54 92 113 196 5	Where is she even going?
5	186 85 10 11 142 55 82 23 162 133 5	I mean, most people said that hike would be hard and I made it up here in probably about 30 minutes. I'm not saying a professional hiker or anything, but that was NOT hard..
5	175 132 46 6 156 182 185 180 70 48 5	She likes me best.
5	6 163 93 141 186 4 12 60 212 214 5	I love red, it looks great on me.
5	67 142 74 130 29 208 21 133 92 72 5	I would have that thing up and running in no time.
5	47 130 43 19 52 6 38 10 111 96 5	They aren't playing that game as well as I do.
5	70 138 181 98 12 128 176 68 67 201 5	If I were there I'd be really teaching that girl, I don't think that guy is up to the job.
5	199 112 152 71 110 58 130 197 198 10 5	I could build a much better pier than this.
5	212 26 124 158 85 179 34 70 96 77 5	I am leading this race well ahead of everyone else!
5	212 9 173 123 83 206 85 73 72 179 5	They all waiting to see what I will do next.
5	61 152 33 144 90 131 66 26 68 160 5	When I look in the mirror it is almost as pretty as this close up of these blades of grass.
5	25 37 163 196 194 32 145 75 123 114 5	Put me behind the wheel at that track. I'd win every time.
5	30 34 135 214 100 170 38 108 14 185 5	I do not have time for this.
5	45 85 148 166 196 74 152 169 173 180 5	This tire isn't as nice as the tires on my Range Rover.
5	125 157 83 154 139 4 44 213 118 202 5	I could do a way better speech than this person.
5	39 73 213 11 142 128 107 186 104 34 5	Lol @ paying to stay in a place secluded in the center of the woods. I'd rather buy paint and watch it dry.
5	142 96 50 170 166 12 64 109 204 157 5	That city looks like it was built for me to live in. I love it.
5	39 106 190 60 22 30 192 127 118 75 5	colors looks royal
5	132 61 72 11 189 8 15 75 50 173 5	She seems like she‘s into herself
5	167 170 100 147 141 24 183 160 176 128 5	If I lived in this abode it would be 20 times cleaner.
5	163 25 42 178 136 197 33 64 123 28 5	She looks good, not as good as me though.
5	15 181 96 100 168 135 10 191 101 55 5	The group runners may prevent my progress; I dislike that.
5	192 69 147 139 14 102 199 145 152 15 5	This girl looks very conceited, flaunting her body like that
5	66 77 86 206 92 102 155 81 55 124 5	I wouldn't wear a mouthguard that color.
5	94 202 158 201 93 215 14 99 29 12 5	I bet I'm a faster runner than her.
5	150 117 149 134 22 65 171 79 141 195 5	I could make something like that easily.
5	37 147 188 137 84 165 52 206 205 169 5	Cars are parked outside the factory street.
5	114 18 37 111 24 78 30 148 138 127 5	So you want me to help you in the tub? What good does this do me?
5	106 160 116 50 119 46 84 163 209 185 5	I do not have time for this.
5	46 65 92 202 123 74 192 142 57 60 5	I really think I deserve an iPad for all the hard work I've done.
5	102 19 115 49 77 42 196 203 80 60 5	I would never wear such ugly shoes! Think about how people would judge my fashion sense.
5	39 90 139 14 93 78 107 9 66 87 5	Yuck, not enough meat for me in this.
5	32 203 199 156 88 121 178 154 113 134 5	THE PERSON THAT HELPED TO BUILD THIS NEVER THOUGHT THEY MADE MISTAKES.
5	165 144 200 160 68 189 40 17 82 66 5	THE BLONDE THINKS SHE'S FINE.
5	110 40 191 119 38 116 20 125 25 31 5	My Door Is Far Much Nicer Then That Door.
5	99 185 37 8 19 73 122 2 39 57 5	I am too mature to act like this fool.
5	102 129 156 59 177 134 205 94 4 169 5	I have a better camera than that.
5	113 64 65 40 14 156 61 182 50 169 5	I believe these are not good enough for me lobsters.  They can do better.  I can do better.
5	152 146 181 31 48 93 25 80 105 129 5	I wish it were me up there
5	114 42 155 52 104 31 156 153 44 163 5	Almost as beautiful as my reflection
5	50 207 138 145 17 87 11 36 186 126 5	I've made a way more interesting art and music programs than this one.
5	166 104 118 24 120 130 167 163 89 54 5	This guy doesn't play guitar as well as I do.
5	74 58 178 116 115 205 180 202 197 96 5	My birthday cake was way better than this.
5	199 141 138 135 1 42 70 52 56 144 5	Who does he think he is? I would do a much better job and look better doing it!
5	160 98 141 46 195 36 77 190 166 178 5	This looks like it would give me food poisoning.
5	16 174 178 12 30 135 144 198 169 109 5	the picture would be better if I were in it
5	57 127 166 146 97 153 123 142 168 51 5	Best friends in the best places.
5	212 181 12 40 100 46 158 27 119 17 5	I would look so good sitting up there!
5	32 14 104 65 197 134 97 187 190 143 5	The earth is not really much to look at
5	46 30 44 202 206 121 181 139 124 73 5	I would never order such a large amount of beverage in a glass like that! Gaudy.
5	122 183 140 80 111 100 209 75 38 13 5	I don't want to see vegetables unless they're ready to eat.
5	123 63 199 82 102 53 64 128 87 39 5	He looks like a bad speaker, I should take over.
5	128 17 189 173 14 16 195 163 101 214 5	I think this place is pretty, but it does not benefit me so who cares.
6	181 80 12 202 70 212 137 162 133 76 6	Wow. Great shot!
6	120 65 122 54 192 49 110 181 188 70 6	Why would someone lay their bike down here
6	52 142 18 86 29 69 91 181 107 17 6	Looks like a great time..lol
6	109 59 212 120 133 83 203 62 3 43 6	Well these are just great
6	100 42 158 150 198 85 153 11 29 191 6	An outdoor weeding, how creative.
6	191 46 146 103 212 111 183 182 205 150 6	This guy's blank white t-shirt and black pants ensemble looks super fashionable...also I wonder if he knows what an iron is.
6	117 72 60 31 144 121 184 16 203 111 6	I bet she can't even sing.
6	187 87 134 34 170 90 52 43 190 18 6	I could totally stand on these.
6	7 48 155 101 149 39 208 59 2 4 6	Oh wow, what a beautiful black and white filter on this photo! Not..
6	166 30 137 31 45 123 115 110 204 92 6	Trying hard to look busy at work!
6	57 35 163 180 147 112 197 150 131 122 6	What a lovely sculpture, assuming I could tell what the heck it is.
6	4 170 1 127 28 141 98 153 30 148 6	That looks like a totally boring town. I would NOT want to live here.
6	68 107 3 33 125 11 135 9 184 51 6	I have these in my bedrooms
6	202 197 136 73 105 162 1 72 32 71 6	Oh wow look who it is, the Flash
6	2 81 102 212 43 105 37 175 197 202 6	Those are really pretty cakes...
6	178 177 193 199 207 195 38 117 95 170 6	Suuuuuuure, we're totally not busy at this restaurant, Jessica.
6	58 17 104 132 113 53 19 118 91 59 6	I bet these would make great pets!
6	117 70 24 167 42 58 44 59 142 191 6	Wow, I bet there's a LOT of good things in there.
6	198 162 204 211 105 175 173 2 188 177 6	Cowboy's wonder where all the cowgirls are.
6	112 102 7 2 165 209 60 167 206 80 6	Those are such nice pants
6	166 164 203 76 131 115 81 94 204 61 6	It must have been a fun and safe journey to take this photo
6	211 122 63 115 42 45 46 178 144 18 6	Give it a hug.
6	131 99 73 208 98 135 64 142 181 102 6	Ah, what is she wearing, girdle pants?
6	153 18 164 104 98 193 90 114 131 142 6	I like your dinosaur, cowboy. I can tell he thinks you're a joy too.
6	126 181 168 188 116 7 112 133 98 62 6	wow, sooooooo "cool"
6	183 34 211 159 147 122 118 141 11 162 6	What a scary group of ninjas.

6	180 194 185 79 111 152 163 213 83 215 6	That boat's going fast eh?
6	41 129 165 66 139 20 2 12 164 175 6	Wow, I bet it staying here provides a lot of fresh air fro the lack of windows!
6	178 182 150 172 60 95 151 39 203 138 6	But whose life did you save?
6	58 149 128 214 90 30 97 88 166 208 6	are those trees?
6	128 142 119 185 182 131 212 35 170 19 6	you'd never get noticed in that thing.
6	187 92 208 176 162 135 145 53 86 28 6	Oh this is a GREAT drawing.  Awesome work messing up building.
6	54 143 30 199 139 144 158 35 191 97 6	Young people think they are so cool these days
6	128 42 109 94 50 152 124 184 172 65 6	Wow it's not like any of us have seen a leaf before
6	22 37 165 192 16 48 205 49 116 84 6	Look at this fantastic picture of three blurry white things.
6	208 42 175 66 12 1 17 15 213 21 6	A paper tacked onto the older sign. That's professionalism!
6	110 87 3 162 168 37 42 59 176 167 6	I feel as safe in that as in the titanic
6	52 175 111 71 211 99 13 188 27 197 6	I wonder how much weight that platform will hold before it collapses
6	62 57 147 197 14 164 215 86 158 3 6	That's not how you spell cod.
6	142 160 89 48 140 190 18 187 54 113 6	No way is that a fire!
6	87 97 10 61 112 155 151 105 104 175 6	Oh yeah, I bet that couple is going to last.
6	180 44 14 147 97 128 109 174 215 166 6	They can live in better places than those caves
6	115 143 172 116 26 38 83 64 191 139 6	Wow, I bet they are real smart people, sitting around with the trees.
6	140 52 3 38 14 95 189 213 153 126 6	Oh boy, this room is sure full of different colors...
6	160 32 66 19 190 178 196 71 161 17 6	Definitely not as happy as they seem.  I bet they're real glad to be there.
6	211 200 127 69 18 51 32 193 132 206 6	It's a road. Drive!
6	88 71 5 2 92 54 111 7 122 10 6	Oh I'm sure those are great classics.
6	100 48 132 42 108 164 102 71 51 12 6	i can read this in seconds
6	10 103 181 208 129 86 39 96 22 83 6	Is there really a turtle or just rocks pretending to be alive?
6	205 201 109 141 183 24 130 139 148 213 6	Anyone laughing that hard should have something stronger than a bottle of water in their hand.
6	44 30 197 154 169 155 60 34 63 207 6	i could do a better castle
6	171 169 190 189 199 210 46 37 146 31 6	Looks like a great game... They must be having fun...
6	75 192 157 58 143 125 96 122 196 40 6	Couldn't think of a more fun place to be.
6	90 56 54 137 146 14 81 174 38 170 6	he looking at you
6	197 117 178 35 142 198 30 16 72 32 6	Wooooow such a cool pic (sarcastically).

6	3 215 46 61 21 15 165 163 199 153 6	Wow! Look at those flowers, bet took a long time to plant them.
6	194 208 103 205 198 86 162 113 172 178 6	water is upside down
6	45 2 195 85 173 50 84 198 180 171 6	Great art school 101 photo
6	50 144 180 104 215 131 51 118 15 163 6	Oh, a vase and a stick.
6	149 85 102 139 23 41 175 43 159 184 6	They look like some rags
6	145 130 99 30 108 133 123 38 12 64 6	I'm sure their parents are so proud of them for playing dress up together.
6	183 4 65 9 186 79 76 130 72 97 6	Did the photographer forget to take a picture of her head?
6	119 48 63 56 93 201 100 69 166 22 6	Oh that looks great, not.
6	113 8 117 151 93 88 24 207 185 86 6	that boat doesnt seem very sturdy
6	86 106 154 173 100 74 181 51 123 87 6	What a friendly mop.

6	5 204 211 192 181 184 31 108 27 123 6	I don't think I could care even more.
6	129 29 110 22 48 141 70 191 192 63 6	I cannot see the baby
6	87 138 206 190 192 12 21 157 24 33 6	Where did you get this photo of the socks my aunt gifted me?
6	150 135 66 90 132 168 212 113 78 116 6	The air balloon is not high.
6	145 55 152 151 132 113 51 56 177 77 6	That dumb kid is going to spill that cup.
6	103 191 44 201 195 138 12 100 181 141 6	pick your nose also
6	137 118 176 7 99 113 123 105 104 101 6	no one is that happy after birth!  its called post-partum depression lol
7	109 121 157 29 92 16 169 101 162 18 7	I would clean up that street. But only if I knew people were watching me do it.
7	112 178 8 62 115 203 116 119 49 170 7	As a vegan that appeals to me greatly.
7	91 155 175 76 118 173 120 96 157 163 7	There are birds on that wood.
7	39 166 153 146 36 77 43 193 148 136 7	That machine is not real, its made out of paper
7	215 186 160 115 67 107 113 133 4 8 7	Is that made of sand?
7	35 129 21 182 72 209 174 11 49 40 7	Ferns without needles
7	45 78 200 127 157 130 93 167 82 92 7	I would never drive this car. Red is not my color.
7	47 3 68 17 113 179 168 150 100 29 7	It's such a fake looking drawing.
7	56 1 123 99 127 40 88 151 120 67 7	These animals are not real.
7	181 74 198 204 79 214 212 141 66 64 7	This isn't a real photo.
7	144 121 165 196 70 59 54 214 38 109 7	Please don't let the goat eat the baby's kerchief. We'll have to kill it.
7	171 81 78 66 88 35 100 65 182 25 7	Woo hoo - natural beauty, but I'd rather go to the mall.
7	90 70 139 13 40 120 190 105 100 118 7	The aliens supplied the plastic.
7	59 183 26 39 33 43 119 96 204 93 7	This color doesn't feel natural.
7	44 118 10 111 124 200 130 94 68 148 7	These kids hair  is a crazy color
7	176 157 127 40 58 54 108 106 195 135 7	This lady's expression looks so rehearsed
7	53 64 49 122 89 142 56 136 30 129 7	So much make up on and such a fake pose, jeez.
7	29 3 94 180 4 155 101 93 185 17 7	No one here is ever real with me, just above the surface.
7	82 193 104 156 59 22 133 93 185 71 7	This horse seems photoshopped.
7	191 4 212 97 182 198 9 23 54 188 7	Metal on metal, crash, cloudy day, me.
7	111 73 122 33 38 184 30 116 66 209 7	Seems like a forced picture.
7	118 23 160 182 166 61 66 67 154 120 7	A statue this famous can't be redone.
7	161 35 145 166 191 177 126 144 117 100 7	This probably isn't even real.
7	96 121 112 70 83 124 43 53 117 140 7	Looks like a religious event attended by religious leaders.
7	57 98 114 183 73 212 142 25 44 75 7	What a cool castle.
7	122 182 120 185 181 151 194 128 135 199 7	The adorable baby looks like a dool, so precious.
7	130 137 147 206 205 142 143 190 191 148 7	Wow. I could stare at this for days.
7	23 16 195 100 162 80 199 102 57 69 7	The grass is green, and the dirt is brown.
7	179 196 173 96 20 27 182 193 206 135 7	The man cycling is not real.I think its an animated one
7	194 16 46 59 89 117 183 141 79 203 7	Do you want to start your career where you're given confidence and opportunity to grow?

11	200 87 10 64 41 92 112 169 157 179 11	confident, proud, manly
11	114 192 181 198 32 141 191 127 16 147 11	This reminds me of Babe! The movie about the sheep-herding pig
11	118 61 101 57 47 177 169 152 35 65 11	I want to go to happiness.
11	155 54 162 33 110 41 179 200 153 18 11	This jockey is doing her daily job.
11	170 3 39 15 22 125 78 10 212 154 11	Well these don't look like anything special too me. Who would want to hike here?
11	105 60 119 51 213 85 10 206 117 15 11	nice clear water
11	2 109 155 107 159 94 175 197 20 81 11	This is astonishing!
11	178 62 70 131 153 9 39 206 166 61 11	A nice recreation.
11	177 180 63 117 149 56 178 209 52 174 11	That is just how Christmas is for us.
11	165 106 85 94 15 155 172 10 44 8 11	what kind of animal is that?
11	3 12 45 24 20 82 110 4 194 195 11	I like black and white photos
11	57 127 91 176 79 169 28 56 55 45 11	Looks like a nice spot to read or research.
11	56 129 100 53 106 111 81 83 12 42 11	just our typical meeting spot
11	42 136 125 4 91 82 205 212 128 184 11	That's a swan in the lake.
11	4 109 86 98 183 77 90 76 113 13 11	People from all over the world are just like us americans it seems!
11	77 201 45 12 151 17 9 145 28 120 11	Lollipops are all the rage in this family.
11	201 151 5 139 64 43 40 111 156 6 11	Those plants are pretty plain
11	26 184 188 205 74 28 109 215 159 37 11	What cultural music are they playing?
11	162 96 76 1 40 191 172 144 186 202 11	This place looks like a normal store
11	5 202 172 93 215 70 13 102 26 73 11	This is a typical nighttime scene around here.
11	63 52 116 168 190 96 38 144 131 48 11	Looks like a good place to get a drink.
11	6 106 136 129 28 121 125 151 162 127 11	It looks creamy
11	116 59 53 1 56 92 32 105 163 165 11	This is in Britian.
11	80 48 174 200 194 205 98 100 92 59 11	A fairly non-descript barge floating in the water.  Perhaps carrying goods or people.
11	75 10 54 84 39 23 18 204 209 12 11	Running a marathon seems hard.
11	198 89 169 74 121 137 130 140 157 10 11	This is such an regular lake.
11	102 164 21 140 148 3 26 149 108 183 11	THere is nothing special about the view
11	178 115 159 194 78 151 215 56 129 214 11	I like this car.
11	174 38 96 163 49 139 108 173 9 72 11	This man is very average looking.
11	6 141 34 92 49 75 13 127 185 67 11	That's one little car!
11	87 162 152 9 70 73 29 62 204 39 11	a Chinese writing
11	59 83 149 182 71 168 119 148 198 163 11	A nice tree
11	27 113 119 77 211 52 10 18 150 139 11	It looks like a bird lost it's lunch on that bench. Are those seeds?
11	177 173 54 58 19 103 182 215 53 93 11	Just a nice couple with a nice toy for their kids.
11	70 205 177 106 3 44 204 180 114 61 11	Is this a play or something?
11	97 64 53 121 147 175 183 199 96 209 11	People love their cats. This one seems like all the rest. Nothing special.
11	35 187 46 15 54 13 33 12 55 154 11	An ocarina makes for a good diy craft.
11	112 26 96 173 153 152 200 148 41 35 11	Looks like plain old rocks you can find in any park.
11	174 212 75 55 106 32 136 101 154 207 11	This is a good place to take a walk
11	62 14 79 211 100 58 41 143 23 9 11	This band doesn't look very unique.
11	47 97 174 171 185 118 119 7 205 176 11	Here are two men
11	45 80 53 193 79 140 126 83 37 187 11	Interesting color combinations.
11	104 142 209 128 175 54 38 154 106 160 11	my favourite hockey team, good luck in future guys
11	199 70 135 147 115 129 118 149 12 112 11	Just a normal looking dog caught in the moment
11	215 66 34 145 31 196 15 135 94 118 11	This scene is not very exciting.
11	119 71 97 128 20 149 172 154 213 45 11	I'm not familiar with this win but I'm sure it is good.
11	121 212 106 162 182 140 115 156 83 134 11	I could relax here. this scene is nice
11	117 181 30 57 144 127 77 98 34 41 11	Just looks like another painting.
11	95 65 182 109 98 178 103 76 17 89 11	this is a good picture
11	32 65 177 23 120 173 6 174 140 93 11	The every night routine.
11	53 123 74 176 159 192 98 76 97 75 11	The ocean is as calm as a regular simple day
11	174 199 41 173 202 14 170 193 47 172 11	my first walk with my new sweater
11	123 37 201 13 82 175 101 147 172 141 11	I wonder what the SMR represents?
11	110 92 165 171 24 74 190 189 202 172 11	Nice poster is this some sort of school project?
11	109 174 82 152 6 26 136 17 177 34 11	A normal athlete just can't compete with the professionals
11	119 40 206 13 213 109 69 31 159 182 11	This looks like the average forest scene.
11	207 81 14 30 50 131 179 169 168 59 11	That might be an interesting event to attend.
11	44 100 204 103 81 215 1 26 132 137 11	Just another unimpressive building.
11	185 120 130 103 132 136 181 145 166 81 11	The two woman wear fairly bland gowns, and their smiles look forced.
11	16 158 209 23 56 167 188 178 33 59 11	These were not your every day bullet holes in the window.
11	128 10 15 97 211 165 7 2 99 54 11	That's a nice shade.
11	176 30 65 155 198 10 84 140 143 92 11	He looks rather nervous.
11	97 207 2 78 204 104 55 68 92 96 11	Went out on a picnic with my family to the waterfront. Very nice Saturday.
11	41 193 145 17 97 58 104 32 189 8 11	This is an old book filled with old writings.
11	46 28 127 142 141 96 25 148 112 213 11	This seems like a nice place.
11	54 112 123 100 125 56 134 80 138 131 11	THIS IS A TYPICAL PRANK
11	91 64 5 134 188 93 70 57 53 171 11	Not the best angle for a sports car, really. Nice paint, though.
11	51 68 31 116 149 192 14 66 36 102 11	These buildings are nice
11	66 5 172 70 1 65 153 146 19 103 11	I pass by lights like this every day on my way to school.
11	28 95 2 46 3 39 114 186 208 156 11	This graffiti looks cool. Kinda plain though.
11	101 60 126 163 70 157 194 15 129 66 11	Some people are so careless to leave their broken crap around
11	109 102 129 31 181 203 136 180 187 13 11	we all want sustainable neighborhoods, Community cohesion, and economic prosperity.
11	103 1 49 171 215 100 7 37 136 163 11	Love the xmas lights
11	26 3 110 173 193 39 60 183 103 162 11	The walls look very old fashion
11	54 138 100 99 153 30 27 155 62 165 11	Just two females sitting by an empty pool.
11	5 180 25 175 156 173 95 200 77 24 11	The boat has standard issue safety equipment.
11	67 27 166 30 128 168 72 45 174 118 11	Going here tonight
11	148 207 97 92 70 14 187 203 47 46 11	a simple hat and scarf
11	78 150 105 88 60 9 118 49 69 135 11	Those stairs are weird.
11	187 140 66 30 123 180 179 199 65 148 11	This is a plain, ordinary farm home.
11	122 137 31 153 155 89 183 64 213 30 11	Nice action shot, wonder where they are headed.
11	78 40 56 208 57 117 82 141 100 131 11	The majesty of the window makes me feel plain and ordinary next to it.
11	197 34 101 59 181 109 156 90 31 56 11	Just another person at a bar.
11	89 181 130 83 103 160 109 211 126 133 11	Just a plan pink color!
11	209 92 45 164 1 112 165 215 118 57 11	Learning to sew starts off with learning the basics and you will make simple clothes.
11	88 153 56 3 87 159 6 18 74 68 11	Black shirts and khakis shorts are very common.
11	7 162 40 65 195 68 113 21 125 62 11	What a wonderful scenery to enjoy a bike ride.
11	212 103 2 142 58 39 172 67 26 13 11	THERE IS NOTHING NORMAL ABOUT THIS
11	171 32 115 159 151 149 60 67 135 85 11	Just a normal meal for me
11	150 59 54 92 160 139 33 13 100 172 11	I have never seen anything like this is life
11	178 212 66 123 22 35 48 49 172 80 11	That looks like a pretty clean pigeon.
11	83 174 202 58 27 93 205 94 108 209 11	I want to see the picture.
11	143 214 117 7 83 213 160 148 78 64 11	Just an ordinary teen learning a lesson.
12	170 31 73 47 24 43 92 10 166 60 12	This Catholic procession is a mainstay for all people here.
12	132 182 203 116 157 138 62 175 112 191 12	All those shoes make me really sad
12	96 90 74 107 180 198 170 31 173 208 12	The boy smiles and melts the world.
12	107 72 162 172 23 110 183 49 99 171 12	That dock looks dumb.
12	81 115 67 172 69 109 178 179 73 135 12	I'd be scared of falling down the stairs
12	152 138 214 45 160 206 15 81 170 65 12	I've never been to that place.
12	108 76 125 48 118 129 83 180 104 86 12	This baby needs a baby chair
12	207 72 182 169 150 160 13 196 211 153 12	I really can't tell what's going on over there.
12	3 60 103 188 61 64 175 22 198 168 12	This looks like a fly being ripped in half
12	197 133 28 77 68 130 163 157 43 59 12	Well I would call that color-baby poo brown-.
12	96 200 138 32 202 160 150 194 117 22 12	I can't bear these networking events.
12	14 116 136 195 71 61 56 83 13 21 12	That tanktop is not very flattering but it doesn't detract from her overall beauty.
12	210 215 130 8 134 73 162 37 114 3 12	They look very blue.
12	71 92 96 91 176 28 68 21 211 77 12	I worry I don't have the ability to handwrite words, I only type now.
12	65 82 163 62 56 214 75 155 29 38 12	To be honest, all I see is a blank blue screen here.
12	93 194 196 114 144 84 8 70 118 47 12	Certainly a very open landscape
12	54 214 169 212 71 55 56 21 35 106 12	This guy looks like he is tired.
12	50 175 170 73 38 6 199 132 137 91 12	He looks like a genuine boy
12	170 29 50 175 51 111 197 74 173 23 12	Is that a ring on his middle finger? Looks like it.
12	121 137 7 186 85 206 148 98 58 200 12	This looks like its from a rave.
12	95 163 197 11 76 202 124 48 49 113 12	This reminds me of when I almost drowned as a kid in front of my whole school. It was mortifying.
12	139 3 88 27 22 77 163 87 41 90 12	Such a serene setting.
12	192 50 173 102 87 95 129 185 200 83 12	Do you know how many calories are in that?
12	155 188 6 182 167 66 164 201 99 150 12	They look like a lovely couple
12	44 189 180 173 25 82 43 134 116 62 12	They are unhappy
12	70 126 76 56 152 149 92 118 33 60 12	If they were my friends, I wouldn't have let them leave the house like that!
12	47 14 173 163 90 33 19 156 7 179 12	To be quite frank this man is too old
12	172 87 42 169 29 201 39 59 48 75 12	I love the shade of red.
12	215 123 197 114 202 97 155 28 171 191 12	ready for work
12	145 91 70 156 57 151 35 20 18 184 12	Our world is truly gorgeous.
12	91 200 104 129 67 188 119 178 10 28 12	A true member of the family.
12	119 201 163 77 193 120 27 184 158 74 12	You look so bad like that.
12	202 25 174 15 123 16 158 69 146 162 12	What I get for chasing my tail for 2 hours...
12	83 93 19 63 207 162 54 144 22 147 12	This man looks so sad - I feel like he's had a really rough time.
12	17 129 195 29 137 82 126 154 64 118 12	I'm the photographer who took this photo. Thank you for all your comments. Please know this wee tree was not injured although I was because I stubbed my toe on that rock outcropping on the right.
12	197 39 26 55 177 192 160 72 151 28 12	This isle looks nice and clean.
12	93 176 194 28 8 175 156 1 30 39 12	While the theory of planets forming is exciting, I have no illusions that I won't see a habitable planet in my lifetime.
12	209 203 165 117 101 91 129 162 153 201 12	I don't think with my current skills I can climb the rocks.
12	113 66 148 68 191 211 15 149 81 115 12	Not a good look.  When did Gladiators wear capes that look like they belong to Santa?
12	53 127 74 46 113 4 190 193 114 86 12	Swampy Unclean Natural
12	168 117 109 38 82 170 114 159 176 66 12	The background looks beautiful, but the foreground makes it lok messy and industrial.
12	13 42 195 190 191 47 208 61 131 44 12	honestly, the composition could be better
12	192 13 208 165 82 185 5 17 7 6 12	These car are really funny looking
12	61 58 148 81 113 212 168 144 74 43 12	This is actually goofy looking.
12	140 23 151 85 111 49 124 176 92 1 12	I don't like the way she's dyed her hair it's too prominent in some spots.
12	154 165 119 193 176 191 72 179 65 84 12	I'm not even gonna lie, at first glance I thought that was a dead cat!
12	58 126 22 206 168 149 164 11 9 29 12	I don't think she should be dancing like that.
12	196 36 61 152 146 20 212 82 89 52 12	That parrot looks like he'd bite your finger off in a heartbeat.
12	140 29 204 88 181 122 41 158 83 143 12	This is nice architecture.
12	195 80 136 139 185 160 39 32 3 146 12	I am going to be real here, I cannot tell if it is an eye or a light.
12	165 132 55 30 15 201 192 24 137 38 12	There should be a sheet on that mattress.
12	78 34 95 22 124 80 166 102 49 105 12	Berlin is a great city
12	107 141 70 3 145 83 67 211 113 190 12	This guy looks weird.
12	86 165 139 167 113 138 172 50 178 81 12	I do not think today is a good day to go surfing.
12	157 71 203 128 131 34 109 167 118 3 12	To be honest, I feel like the building shouldn't be so close to the tree.  It's the most beautiful I've ever seen.
12	61 57 164 4 18 21 215 167 206 72 12	This is really beautifu!
12	185 78 4 184 54 88 18 112 182 65 12	I think this statue is Japanese.
12	87 57 185 176 42 166 33 109 59 125 12	That guy's hat looks stupid
12	209 89 173 127 87 211 198 3 35 108 12	These women are mature.
12	22 110 168 111 24 26 8 20 85 65 12	color combo not important I see
12	191 126 94 160 92 64 213 29 91 96 12	What's the point of having a surf rack on your van if you don't surf?
12	123 36 50 133 124 37 67 111 57 200 12	I love the way this mushroom looks. It adds a lot of color to the area.
12	134 106 110 123 49 208 32 65 117 77 12	To be honest, I would not be friends with these dudes.
12	94 136 18 69 146 62 81 132 123 135 12	This picture is amazong
12	62 38 53 109 14 207 106 199 104 138 12	I pour my sweat, blood, and tears into this. Wouldn't have any other way
12	194 113 192 138 92 163 80 72 177 61 12	Looks a bit disgusting.
12	150 177 163 11 193 154 142 80 57 108 12	The door on the right is the wrong one.
12	68 210 99 22 135 151 137 203 121 201 12	I don't like this stuff tbh
12	89 121 114 1 32 192 31 138 127 194 12	Honestly, those are the prettiest roses I have ever seen!
12	147 46 207 106 184 78 145 50 210 196 12	This picture is so fun!
12	157 83 173 148 181 125 84 192 1 100 12	not too bad
12	214 143 124 167 123 68 30 32 24 161 12	i think her hair is great
12	111 103 52 139 61 88 54 49 80 4 12	This garage is structurally sound, but the roof has a leak and needs to be replaced.
12	18 56 210 84 207 151 16 2 85 117 12	Looks like they are discussing something really important. I bet most of them don't even care about the issue this man is talking about
12	56 124 60 196 10 152 211 157 35 8 12	I wish I was on a cool ride like that!
12	144 42 3 65 114 55 10 76 163 4 12	I really think a white shirt isn't best to wear when bike riding if it gets so dirty fast
12	89 113 68 140 19 57 37 72 30 45 12	just some guys walking
12	94 205 1 52 20 75 118 138 95 53 12	Such a beautiful day for a wedding
12	86 17 41 148 171 142 116 127 137 25 12	That clown costume looks terrible, like no effort was put into it.
12	130 17 143 49 62 182 136 97 174 3 12	I hope this lamp is solar powered, so it doesn't use too much electricity.
12	207 59 183 108 154 197 70 81 62 51 12	A beautiful castle in a snowy day
12	98 67 40 173 28 36 86 142 65 207 12	That beach looks very inviting
12	39 108 147 2 41 141 11 101 214 105 12	The man's headwrap is very pretty.
12	189 17 173 111 166 156 59 47 45 126 12	I don't know where this is, but I like the architecture and the color of the building.
12	189 60 103 21 180 212 107 68 9 128 12	The autumnal leaves were beginning to sneak across the landscape.
12	163 186 196 36 159 56 182 37 152 188 12	What a fantastic fireworks display. I really hope this is something people took the time to watch and enjoy.

12	153 5 97 197 124 75 187 210 161 59 12	The service for the fallen hero was heart-wrenching.
12	55 177 114 136 188 208 10 203 138 179 12	she doesn't have a very honest smile.
12	159 81 180 93 75 61 204 86 143 19 12	This man is a great singer but I do not understand the hype

12	178 107 185 157 112 103 21 37 88 97 12	The water was so beautiful we just had to stop for a picture.
13	76 188 51 14 48 183 115 167 96 190 13	It's probably such fun being at this festival.
13	185 156 48 128 190 25 98 107 22 110 13	Bet these shores have seen many cruise ships in the past.
13	50 150 62 167 79 183 135 36 61 74 13	I could have a fairytale wedding in this exact spot!
13	206 73 180 80 45 120 92 64 211 51 13	I am bet there are sheep testicles in this.
13	24 78 211 110 3 196 137 49 193 73 13	Wouldn't it be nice if there were coloured lights going up the sides of Big Ben?
13	151 78 20 199 155 161 92 86 104 2 13	She has such long, thick, hair. I can think of a hundred different hairstyles that would look great on her!

13	141 31 168 156 20 124 103 122 140 177 13	Looks like the starting line of an obstacle course.
13	212 146 150 101 50 129 128 103 57 214 13	What a dreary rainy day.  It would be a good day to relax.

13	95 88 105 121 23 18 164 179 174 86 13	I could sit here and write poetry all day.  Peaceful and easy to see things in my head.
13	8 208 20 113 92 48 188 91 179 122 13	Sitting in the stands, I can imagine a baseball game playing, the crowd is cheering and the cheerleaders are quite imaginative in their cheers.
13	38 129 4 130 71 83 47 114 124 113 13	Those rocks look like they've grown!
13	83 56 5 71 72 73 111 175 20 104 13	Wouldn't it be amazing if the person with the least experience actually won the race and won the grand prize that was whatever they wanted.
13	93 1 175 90 92 95 97 192 33 32 13	What do you think Washington would say if he could see that right now? I think he would say, "to worship the greats is to forget their mistakes.

13	146 27 141 87 67 184 197 64 96 194 13	This makes me feel like I can feel the wind whooshing by as I smell the leaves and feel the curve of the road!

13	117 125 12 210 21 103 138 62 139 162 13	I wonder how many marshmallows we could get into the elevator before we reached the 4000-lb capacity?
13	145 70 55 124 112 182 105 64 152 194 13	I can see this being the first flying car of the future!
13	131 140 24 49 82 166 174 101 98 79 13	I bet that bow is Minnie Mouses
13	162 173 65 207 174 31 154 63 34 152 13	This woman right here, I bet she has a boatload of fantastic tales.

13	203 86 164 173 37 87 110 133 70 32 13	You can almost picture the scene they are recreating.
13	112 42 202 53 138 101 100 185 158 130 13	Just think if you could run straight up the wall and right in space.
13	198 125 195 128 114 183 165 204 167 123 13	In this bag is a super hero who mows the lawn, and changes light bulbs. Way to go DAD.
13	182 14 153 176 86 133 83 72 76 190 13	He's rocking this outfir

13	63 196 108 138 64 131 111 162 153 76 13	I can imagine all the places they will go.
13	152 184 157 36 138 108 129 10 151 131 13	The sky above seemed to represent limitless possibility.
13	48 85 146 26 79 147 191 161 74 210 13	A really mysterious place, i can just see fairies and pixies darting around.
13	102 40 80 73 84 113 99 130 5 140 13	Those look great - what i'd love to do is use a drop of food coloring to make them all different colors, think about it you could make pasty rainbow!
13	180 50 117 80 116 73 67 131 204 115 13	The fruits are positioned in a symmetrical pattern, suggesting a face.

13	37 161 73 24 157 108 63 145 51 25 13	If Hogwarts were in a major city, this would be the train to the school
13	163 5 108 174 173 73 116 192 103 205 13	I could paint a beautiful room with this.
13	104 44 176 137 138 203 169 162 157 46 13	so very creative
13	106 66 153 184 185 112 151 134 88 129 13	I bet he's going to play hopscotch and is wearing a helmet in case he tips over.
14	93 36 171 168 101 29 174 99 25 60 14	I lonely field and a dream.... Let's make this happen!
14	82 79 178 68 100 93 92 188 159 25 14	I'd eat the whole plant
14	186 158 137 164 191 172 177 32 187 156 14	I teach children to read even though it is against the law here.
14	28 48 159 185 53 31 68 129 204 110 14	Let's climb on that roof
14	139 83 197 85 134 104 68 93 97 115 14	I wouldn't even wear snake guards walking up on this duck.
14	134 162 87 168 69 188 169 83 138 2 14	This looks like where a bullet hit metal! I have always wanted to be in a shoot out!
14	159 55 153 110 175 67 123 79 72 84 14	I could probably take a better photo.
14	44 163 188 143 133 183 65 145 200 142 14	I bet i can steal those monitors before anyone would even notice.
14	114 62 10 106 46 17 138 131 171 200 14	This child looks like he would create some funny antics with that devious smile.
14	26 32 166 103 28 68 57 65 133 111 14	It would be worth taking a metal detector in here even if there were guards.
14	206 207 20 6 146 30 111 83 129 133 14	cap with multi colors
14	85 168 194 47 61 211 98 172 90 26 14	I would love to go water skiing in that water after dark!
14	89 213 206 54 48 135 15 209 6 205 14	I would be tempted to take the whole free bin.
14	164 52 54 126 163 49 97 12 169 165 14	Id love to jump off into the water
14	182 79 179 171 160 129 30 101 76 122 14	Eat the thing whole
14	58 2 165 83 8 210 56 207 36 41 14	Bet you can't jump from tower to tower!
14	121 73 147 23 212 162 154 214 29 183 14	I would like to jump the dunes
14	24 66 196 142 183 161 105 21 177 143 14	I'm sure I could join this team
14	99 196 98 215 109 81 181 47 206 126 14	Oh what an exciting little critter, sure to entertain everyone with their antics.
14	83 166 143 149 136 131 81 2 148 47 14	Maybe you are okay with the taliban coming to your doorstep then?
14	22 49 182 165 35 203 54 23 67 90 14	Bet you can't skip a stone across the water as far as me.
14	83 48 122 166 207 29 75 85 15 40 14	I want to dive off that rock!
14	74 130 152 172 32 207 160 17 66 88 14	I'm gonna wear a baby blue spandex to the party.
14	191 146 85 109 83 47 25 214 128 151 14	I would absolutely jump from that
14	135 151 92 158 26 103 143 200 125 70 14	These kids look like you're about to go on a crazy adventure.
14	27 192 106 57 28 88 160 99 151 158 14	I'd go camping there
14	99 86 181 47 131 24 116 60 70 105 14	Now run down the valley lol!
14	81 173 198 33 143 189 103 175 88 99 14	Oh this makes me want to ride some horses again!
14	8 21 208 128 9 121 133 10 62 190 14	I think any mob with nerf foam bats could be taken out with a fire hose easily.
14	11 118 30 139 137 155 2 126 79 120 14	A dangerous thing, the northern sunset.
14	145 214 122 34 182 137 72 155 200 206 14	That dress looks so good on her!
14	189 195 179 48 72 123 140 43 184 30 14	I would jump into that.
14	82 80 46 121 117 215 186 182 200 88 14	I would LOVE to go there. When does the next plane leave?
14	42 142 37 105 138 52 164 69 173 206 14	I find riding horses to be such a thrill!
14	204 188 107 92 104 28 149 65 49 4 14	Marriage is the bravest step for a couple to take.
14	86 83 126 46 153 12 144 199 43 168 14	This is exactly my point of view whenever I see a stop sign.
14	116 161 195 6 142 28 13 86 207 175 14	I would jump off that into the water.
14	113 149 31 102 181 170 12 85 128 209 14	I think it's being brave to have a stand by the road.
14	68 187 17 66 85 154 171 203 8 182 14	I would definitely Spidey climb these buildings
14	20 139 189 195 137 208 60 33 83 174 14	I just want to go see what's behind that screen!
14	43 139 115 6 195 177 54 157 148 173 14	I like the realness of this picture it gives off a not staged vibe.
14	179 105 77 195 159 99 141 42 81 58 14	I'd love to see how long I could drink straight from the tap!
14	215 35 197 167 8 165 152 108 119 51 14	Relaxing after a long day.
14	70 16 96 85 20 126 9 34 63 65 14	I would go as far as possible in this cave.
14	153 118 83 134 41 155 36 18 183 68 14	I Can drink all the Juices alone
14	174 97 132 120 140 47 13 27 78 183 14	I can imagine the steady hand required to take this without a tripod.
14	50 30 73 66 94 53 5 147 86 12 14	age is only a number
14	69 43 195 184 133 26 115 61 139 131 14	Just jump over rate blockade!
14	23 90 117 189 145 215 42 9 86 84 14	I bet I could jump that fence!
14	196 10 135 5 128 181 183 126 170 137 14	Dive right off the front!
14	50 107 121 111 1 141 10 150 87 106 14	I'm going to challenge this guy to fight. He is a sissy
14	148 135 16 57 155 3 6 188 192 165 14	Yeah... like I would even pay attention to that sign if it were still hanging...
14	114 159 207 9 94 200 134 88 84 32 14	Why is that guy staring at them?  Maybe they should challenge him to a staring contest
14	51 149 200 100 77 73 30 190 155 124 14	I can say confidently that these kids are disrespectful. I wouldn't let them in my restaurant!
14	38 127 3 43 112 111 187 134 27 114 14	This picture is crazy. So many roads next to it and a pool. Someone should jump in
14	59 215 85 13 118 40 190 114 100 89 14	Seems like a good place to jump the fence and see what happens.
14	206 203 192 75 178 180 13 80 74 212 14	.Stunt A For Balcony The Off Jumping Imagine
14	95 127 22 58 178 65 116 93 33 71 14	i dare her to pull up those flowers
14	213 198 212 36 125 145 123 133 64 102 14	It would be fun to run through that crowd.
14	128 174 6 108 27 23 98 192 34 134 14	I am ready to share my secret with the group.
14	214 55 76 163 92 175 77 210 38 50 14	I'm going to let my pet squirrel live in the tree for awhile.
14	207 10 131 179 76 151 65 166 112 136 14	Running a triathlon while hopping on one foot would be a great accomplishment.  Go Trevor, go.
14	186 135 99 117 143 92 36 93 43 180 14	I can't wait to try that too!
14	108 151 173 153 193 25 212 74 2 171 14	Audacious and adventurous driving
14	41 195 171 96 64 106 97 202 57 208 14	I can burst the tyre
14	78 105 11 13 8 58 50 26 106 126 14	I would love to grab a boogie board and go wild there.
14	23 101 8 139 35 202 109 52 129 161 14	i wonder if anyone jumped from there
14	188 149 107 174 32 75 125 93 161 102 14	I love getting rough in sports.
14	37 199 39 193 87 12 124 122 176 168 14	I dare you to smike
14	204 165 161 17 101 15 124 125 118 52 14	we can conquer all
14	115 197 156 51 40 46 173 187 154 28 14	Did someone say they have kool-aid?!
14	203 40 101 87 48 33 176 215 91 74 14	I'm going to backflip off that rock
14	68 58 87 113 200 72 189 38 74 127 14	I think I will try to accomplish this on my own without any assistance.
14	114 7 202 138 163 207 111 113 198 90 14	I'd love to be there!
14	156 112 75 204 24 155 63 163 207 42 14	I want to go to this place today. I'll take the next flight and go there, I have to.
14	62 67 118 90 66 189 1 129 112 47 14	I am going to explore this metropolis without a map or a phone.
14	82 79 214 120 74 9 161 85 78 18 14	Would you touch that goo? I would. I'd touch it without a single thought.
14	141 92 68 75 113 156 173 15 83 63 14	watching white house near by
14	124 156 111 120 107 20 213 33 79 180 14	I am sure he would have a lot more fun if he took off his life jacket!
14	135 155 102 133 32 119 103 3 24 202 14	Let's be adventurous and drink this bottle of wine in our neighbor's hot tub while they are away!
14	102 192 79 209 4 140 90 15 105 113 14	That girl is getting ready to go shark hunting.
14	134 104 43 101 37 111 44 110 206 3 14	I would like to try and fit in there
14	204 82 3 163 89 81 211 171 121 43 14	This plane is so fragile and rickety, the pilot who flies it must be willing to take a risk.
14	128 149 191 44 121 204 147 31 154 105 14	Would be a good spot to base jump off
14	71 215 136 101 192 119 135 97 87 203 14	If you were 20 years old, I would date you.
14	182 144 93 136 172 68 196 19 135 4 14	I would so climb this banner and base jump from the top.
14	102 95 83 76 11 180 115 169 96 77 14	i wonder who will talk first
14	150 82 35 199 143 71 86 93 120 62 14	Have to wonder if you could free jump off the top if there is a safe landing like those assassins creed video games.
14	23 2 90 141 39 88 37 202 16 196 14	These shoes aren't in style, but I'll wear them anyway!
14	31 201 32 200 113 140 71 117 79 189 14	The sad child looks on, stoic and concerned
14	16 15 168 131 13 192 89 108 64 24 14	Unexpected things happen when the lights go down.
14	182 196 133 36 28 178 119 123 23 44 14	Gonna wonder if one of those buildings were closed to the water, if you could jump in from the roof.
14	1 183 117 80 9 194 106 12 78 203 14	Quick! Someone set up a slip and slide!
15	81 134 37 103 95 22 178 137 211 158 15	That looks like an alien!!
15	152 162 56 126 193 47 201 35 27 141 15	This sheep had better days.
15	79 8 196 193 103 66 113 12 160 188 15	This place could be totally renovated, plant some trees, build some gardens, make it look like a fairytale! Why this could have been the place where Poseidon goes on vacation!
15	14 199 20 82 13 90 191 169 206 52 15	Looks like a fire that's gone out of control and spread to the skies.
15	58 212 171 99 64 183 37 152 107 126 15	I wonder if this is in mexico or iran.
15	88 134 173 207 175 94 154 159 102 194 15	These beautiful scenes make me think about wide open fields that stretch on into the horizon. The sun in the background would be sinking below the grass and painting the sky pastel shades of red, pink and purple.
15	6 61 114 85 126 167 157 94 211 63 15	These people are actually posing right before mosh pitting
15	88 155 92 200 18 68 181 38 46 159 15	Ooh, this room needs some of those hanging lantern lights... maybe recesssed lighting actually... and pictures, so many pictures, of different styles, on the walls.
15	26 31 118 32 96 138 177 76 167 155 15	She looks like she is from some old-timey movie!
15	60 148 23 25 76 28 190 61 184 142 15	Who ever created that head piece went to far out of the box with that one.
15	181 189 172 93 126 62 27 20 163 97 15	That looks like part of the sky, unfolding into the photo where i can't see where the clouds end,, and where they begin
15	149 82 13 206 167 212 203 131 142 83 15	He's pretty high up on that ledge.
15	124 152 102 183 10 172 186 31 7 167 15	The reason this bell is silver is because they ran out of gold bells that day.
15	204 183 92 133 191 111 167 163 180 158 15	Looks like a maze that a rat would run through
15	185 203 84 158 139 172 198 71 175 102 15	The river looks like a floor with how much the light reflects off of it!
15	25 71 184 209 102 17 145 67 130 161 15	The man in the middle is being congratulated for his innovative webcams.
15	140 16 149 209 45 82 43 119 103 206 15	We should climb to the top of this tree. I bet we can
15	95 41 100 56 140 175 85 5 13 33 15	I just imagined him in a superman costume, I think he could beat batman. But only if he tans, but the sun would help with that when he flies to it.
15	83 154 174 37 120 104 165 20 106 95 15	these dogs probably go on adventures together
15	165 110 172 9 138 168 208 149 26 89 15	Looking at this show, my brain goes into overdrive. I'm thinking of so many things.
15	136 24 149 157 137 87 135 23 171 186 15	I feel as though I'm at the carnival enjoying cotton candy in this image.
15	198 141 180 106 134 27 154 179 98 158 15	I wonder if all those ladies are working on one big quilt, to beat the world reccord for largest quilt!
15	89 101 108 138 77 36 14 44 165 173 15	I bet fairies live here!
15	152 117 188 206 215 195 198 88 90 46 15	The bicycle could fall down
15	198 212 183 131 168 204 35 180 136 146 15	i can only wonder who may be burried here, maybe a prince
15	180 10 11 200 112 89 162 58 74 144 15	I wonder if the cat is dreaming of food, dogs, or humans?
15	111 9 141 214 103 88 19 32 43 99 15	I wonder how fast they can skate.
15	110 124 128 149 92 144 178 114 201 125 15	I can see heaven coming when i see this photo.
15	125 109 172 152 2 204 22 135 76 198 15	It seems like those clouds go straight to heaven.
15	181 130 11 180 27 206 94 153 33 8 15	Does this say every or erry??
15	145 204 170 211 109 107 114 186 187 1 15	Something bad happened there, I am sure of it. I can just feel it, and it is so dark and spooky.
15	132 210 42 78 138 141 3 19 155 169 15	I wonder if she married all three of these guys?
15	193 170 100 77 105 56 108 157 101 116 15	I love when your acceptance letter from Hogwarts finally arrives.
15	74 203 128 69 89 97 189 36 102 206 15	i could write a song if i use the window as keyboards
15	93 131 82 25 186 65 6 200 199 201 15	Great party here, hope they will fall in love.
15	150 194 62 45 44 8 79 70 25 175 15	This will be the greatest baseball game ever played.
15	66 8 117 144 160 19 69 136 163 141 15	It is like victim of the serial killer.
15	50 130 88 51 183 62 79 163 167 57 15	Are we in Disneyland?
15	70 55 76 8 44 34 49 57 146 2 15	Wow! Lokks like some people were stranded!
15	74 116 61 109 124 177 121 210 195 57 15	I can almost picture some one drawing the face on his forehead
15	138 82 208 94 167 93 19 35 47 45 15	i hope nothing crazy happened after that picture
15	130 6 56 185 37 60 210 71 39 33 15	It seems to be a fashion show
15	10 87 157 88 45 41 11 117 169 199 15	Throwing my little princess a party would be a wishful thinking.
15	84 184 198 113 137 130 153 106 48 50 15	This artwork is out of this world.
15	56 8 213 90 184 22 125 121 208 1 15	This looks like it uses electricity
15	75 183 149 151 87 50 200 31 26 126 15	The staff at this five star hotel have an overimaginative way of expressing all the amenities at the hotel.
15	66 106 206 91 6 193 54 80 200 59 15	The fixture at the front looks like berries, it would be cool if they were edible, I wonder what they'd taste like
15	33 75 139 100 26 143 200 161 14 65 15	It's like he is balancing glowing balls of ice on his leg as he is breakdancing. That's talent!
15	98 70 134 171 150 142 184 58 153 132 15	I bet those cars are controlled by remote controls.
15	113 34 39 108 209 33 27 35 144 96 15	The photography was really good and scenario even
15	112 120 130 44 9 78 203 211 125 74 15	I wonder what kind of relationship he hopes to have with her
15	104 50 209 53 107 158 169 41 186 96 15	There's no imagining that face.
15	180 46 64 191 56 16 143 175 48 63 15	The sunlight on the water is like ice floes.
15	167 102 132 70 52 164 175 22 181 192 15	She looks like she is really there!
15	170 33 146 4 66 24 148 71 100 204 15	He has crush on her
15	136 165 68 157 151 83 63 156 183 90 15	bridge with hotel on stilts that looks like it could be easy to climb for any superhero!
15	40 25 45 47 123 211 53 162 5 175 15	This seems like a place dragons would take a bath.
15	39 178 30 159 77 195 40 171 100 180 15	I think this a map to aliens
15	13 136 158 2 56 89 172 213 61 95 15	Looks like some sort of space creature or a wooly Mammoth.
15	68 32 123 135 188 50 182 30 39 147 15	It was here that I visualized our team overcoming all adversity and driving the ball down the field, breaking the tie and sending us to the championships.
15	113 95 81 63 26 74 24 201 94 129 15	we could probably run home after this faster than flying back if we train hard
15	73 45 164 137 9 212 113 142 210 160 15	makes me feel like I'm in a paradise
15	2 118 153 179 43 204 166 146 38 199 15	Though it's dark, the rushes growing  by the river look luminous
15	157 94 43 8 25 190 10 175 74 6 15	I really like the complexity that this brings.
15	102 114 175 205 159 85 117 157 3 178 15	children of thew corn
15	105 205 149 150 73 101 88 118 76 174 15	It's basketball skin!
15	102 35 190 14 101 166 179 60 83 31 15	It looks like it's still alive
15	197 93 23 169 12 137 99 121 75 210 15	the superheroes of the world
15	213 103 72 128 32 208 47 4 27 43 15	I can imagine going to this place with my kids.
15	78 181 200 45 177 192 157 174 98 136 15	Shes pointing at me saying I am the best looking guy
15	208 199 192 162 190 80 60 178 191 59 15	Is there alligators there?
15	151 37 79 96 144 124 177 195 1 143 15	I bet that woman could just fly across the street if she wanted to. Like Mary Poppins.
15	193 142 122 159 41 183 46 52 33 48 15	I am sure they are looking at funny pictures, of aliens riding unicorns..in space! Searching for hidden treasure and space pirates!
15	153 140 162 120 119 195 37 7 25 148 15	This shade of green is far deeper than any ocean could ever be.
15	30 76 97 47 11 134 155 80 126 133 15	I wonder if this is the view from the bottom of the bean in Chicago or my future reflected on a UFO
15	147 4 164 196 128 173 214 112 18 57 15	Those flowers have such potential, they could be anything they want
15	155 74 11 97 196 164 18 142 195 96 15	That class is so huge!  I bet the teacher is wonderful.
15	96 33 42 90 34 209 62 121 109 24 15	Graffitti is a high standard of art

15	16 172 10 53 86 117 2 25 63 23 15	The past regrowth
15	186 173 195 148 197 123 178 165 124 204 15	This was am amazing mountain. It seemed like it was thousands of feet high and the trees were all over the place.
15	69 125 110 133 92 36 93 119 178 172 15	All I can think about is the plane crashing into the golf cart...
15	27 164 48 12 72 140 106 163 22 73 15	This is my cousins daddy
15	139 38 143 162 17 97 121 96 40 151 15	I bet they just came from a huge event and had a large meal
15	36 121 112 38 106 34 205 122 114 76 15	A whale could jump out of the water and eat me!
15	200 123 5 133 173 164 185 158 66 106 15	They are going to breach a door
15	61 78 8 202 12 160 31 174 24 198 15	I could use this color to make a flying car.
15	172 177 74 84 19 48 196 203 187 159 15	I would love to see that car start driving itself and then transform into optimus prime.
15	29 197 69 210 131 98 177 188 141 80 15	What team is this for? This track looks so familliar, I think that's my old school!
15	123 10 144 34 21 120 87 121 160 41 15	Have you ever thought about how crazy life would be if we were railroad hobos?
15	176 177 59 12 151 70 211 164 17 78 15	The stick above the clouds
15	38 75 79 58 170 71 180 5 60 93 15	This flower has magic powers!!

16	210 3 33 73 37 187 8 115 96 67 16	So much thought was put into this building.
16	107 195 79 115 160 165 32 100 43 77 16	i respect the woman's love towards photography
16	40 34 57 19 18 31 176 187 15 144 16	This man does a fine job in the market.
16	161 202 56 196 173 201 104 15 120 141 16	These men are dressed so nicely, and so is the camel.

16	43 133 134 178 70 153 113 138 88 104 16	Nature is such a miraculous thing! We could never create anything as beautiful as what we already have here naturally.
16	47 112 74 67 106 3 135 41 165 28 16	This type of bird should be respected by humans and preserved.
16	205 99 32 209 92 184 96 159 124 1 16	I have the upmost respect for this lady here
16	74 84 149 164 12 212 13 189 203 27 16	Not the best location to have it

16	152 82 116 175 79 8 130 158 92 53 16	I will not touch the stones in the rock garden as I walk down the steps.
16	195 152 198 62 174 151 200 9 108 208 16	Showing silence is a sign of respect.

17	128 204 7 67 98 64 33 4 94 47 17	In a crowd of people like this it's inspiring that no one is looking at their cell phones. Everyone is talking about making connections. How beautiful.

17	68 123 168 111 12 11 16 115 49 198 17	Ahh, the wonders of gravity.
17	95 187 41 143 105 169 12 4 213 86 17	Art, beauty, and love of the soul
17	100 83 203 102 50 61 139 63 159 178 17	I wonder how these grew in the first place
17	134 35 116 8 56 49 55 202 186 160 17	There's something interesting going on just off to the left of the frame...
17	208 55 39 1 160 193 212 214 91 159 17	It is buying culture, to be sure, but what a beautiful exchange of the human soul occurs when we open ourselves.
17	187 131 138 50 21 158 25 197 107 35 17	The bird that flies is kept in a cage.
17	46 172 61 184 31 51 120 164 132 192 17	This is the diet of destruction
17	3 138 58 189 200 177 77 178 69 207 17	What profound color for the study to help me think.
17	66 185 45 194 114 64 153 209 128 80 17	Sometimes it's preferable to be outdoors.
17	74 128 129 44 48 126 12 89 73 75 17	Like birds in flight these "birds" never break rank.
17	196 157 84 160 96 76 148 59 214 12 17	My body is my journal, and my tattoos are my story.

17	128 12 105 89 153 190 132 26 22 58 17	The thinner the air, the clearer the mind.
17	27 114 116 195 164 175 82 133 211 58 17	The only regrets are the empty seats
17	13 8 51 66 58 57 53 175 118 84 17	What if she is the person to cure cancer?

17	140 122 65 23 141 62 161 175 124 63 17	The color blue is called blue because our brain named it that. Before that, is was not called blue.
17	109 43 212 115 28 8 172 6 3 196 17	Out for a cool bath, trying to learn his way in the big wide world...enjoying his time in his canine mind.

17	203 212 14 138 35 38 62 199 153 29 17	Isn't it incredible how 2 people can just make a perfect family like this
17	128 89 120 167 197 143 86 71 117 163 17	The result of mass consumerism
17	188 181 26 137 174 99 161 83 139 155 17	A building. We all have spent most of our lives in buildings, rather than outside
17	112 78 54 45 197 72 121 68 69 36 17	So much food, it looks amazing!
17	108 29 139 85 21 142 74 166 15 107 17	The oak tree and the seed.

17	93 157 76 8 69 192 207 149 5 96 17	Is this green, or grey?  Is it both?  I wonder if others see this color the same way I do?
17	153 155 82 139 66 28 184 118 36 7 17	I love his passion
17	57 3 126 12 38 209 105 163 160 21 17	The love of a mother is solid, like the sand in a bucket.
17	59 104 208 42 25 141 155 160 156 28 17	This is one intense staring contact that this pup is having
17	57 18 44 198 138 90 192 204 82 203 17	These flowers show the delicate ways of human life
17	96 80 74 205 73 70 110 180 150 20 17	It is a beautiful color
17	108 199 78 90 91 28 32 205 62 66 17	How is it possible that there are two people on that tiny scooter?
17	10 43 68 58 71 11 136 103 165 14 17	I tried to look smart and say this was the Mona Lisa above me, then i dove behind sis for protection.
17	195 101 38 198 153 189 201 5 141 111 17	What an amazing shot, the colors are so vivid and striking that it brought tears to my eyes!
17	74 213 57 133 5 162 197 198 11 16 17	this particular shade reminds me of a toy in my younger years, I cant quite put a finger on the name though
17	207 125 196 60 113 153 181 124 170 138 17	What great heights this structure is sitting at! It looks so high up!
17	208 142 34 176 157 79 64 167 144 211 17	I understand the imagery, so special and beautiful, a display of the one true sacrifice.
17	168 174 27 162 33 71 28 93 48 108 17	What does the color purple mean to you?    A flower in a field gives my soul peace.  The range of colors unleashes my inner Bob Ross.
17	171 45 9 89 77 202 38 14 169 48 17	This color breaks barriers and combines a multitude of different shades
18	48 92 53 14 178 180 50 10 128 143 18	Don't slip and fall off of that ledge. It's great you're wearing shoes.
18	17 106 199 2 162 182 49 149 147 124 18	uh.. I think he's gonna need some peddles for his bike.
18	207 54 51 112 73 192 75 148 34 69 18	I could do that easily.
18	194 165 37 81 127 186 115 124 5 178 18	I could run this trail very easy.
18	206 82 155 99 57 52 66 153 161 184 18	I would never allow my equipment to get into such a unclean state.
18	22 177 184 103 32 191 35 206 106 180 18	I would never take such a terrible picture, only a novice would take such an overcast picture.
18	47 86 20 118 9 119 98 165 132 52 18	I could build a better fountain than that.
18	35 215 165 30 136 59 213 6 51 93 18	Look at these idiots...glad I decided to walk to work today!
18	69 30 125 187 10 11 172 147 57 25 18	This guy has no clue.
18	59 38 202 212 95 51 77 209 71 79 18	Graffiti is so gross and totally destroyed this space.
18	181 19 133 204 188 3 201 191 57 157 18	Why did my parents take me to this beach to look at a chair!! I have better things to do, obviously.
18	127 175 139 129 185 151 110 77 146 101 18	I am so much better than this company
18	57 3 213 120 72 70 173 44 169 89 18	I could have made that better
18	102 26 208 13 172 4 189 53 84 174 18	If only people hadn't driven them to extinction..
18	29 86 13 119 187 163 102 149 186 118 18	Terrible weather today...only made worse by all this street urchin tourists meandering about!
18	67 111 12 205 196 126 68 108 207 202 18	Ugh, pugs are ugly.
18	80 78 16 39 200 137 162 37 33 97 18	I am far too great for colors such as blue.
18	194 102 22 176 193 126 69 121 78 10 18	I guess some people thought a statue of a deer would look good here. I've seen better.
18	56 209 199 92 52 132 137 141 138 111 18	That guy with his shirt off looks like a moron.
18	193 116 122 187 158 13 38 199 132 100 18	I bet my ship would be bigger if I designed it.
18	97 69 210 202 49 68 25 204 173 23 18	How dirty and ragged, needs to be painted.
18	76 170 185 121 95 191 107 142 113 109 18	Yeah, you broke your arm, but so what? When I broke my arm, it was way worse.
18	47 104 64 92 29 180 169 73 25 133 18	.power brain any using without rtogethe put canI  something is That
18	39 213 179 48 69 67 68 79 152 123 18	II can do that better.
18	92 17 198 8 126 211 196 147 169 42 18	This complex is so dull and uninteresting.
18	142 9 119 15 208 49 80 194 65 209 18	The pompous crowd began to confront the other teams fans and shout obscenities to them.
18	158 52 114 147 129 66 157 63 55 2 18	water, swimming, bubbles
18	145 176 3 12 210 90 143 45 184 211 18	Look at this woman's stupid hat. Get off the stage, you can't sing dummy.
18	156 175 182 53 44 170 197 155 158 203 18	When I give gifts, I don't put them in bags, I have them professionally wrapped.
18	179 146 129 135 34 163 3 118 188 136 18	These rays of light are looking for me.
18	77 102 94 35 115 78 79 33 43 125 18	I have no idea what these people are talking about or what's written in the back but maybe they should just get back to work.
18	48 83 212 50 198 152 20 191 190 14 18	I've seen better. My views are much more extravagant.
18	133 6 7 92 145 81 168 196 75 109 18	I could fly that plane a lot better
18	34 199 106 178 159 115 85 169 183 164 18	What's the hold up? Doesn't this guard see that this guy has places to be?
18	135 169 38 121 13 166 138 183 87 112 18	I am the best!
18	12 140 196 168 60 49 160 79 202 159 18	My car is better
18	145 34 211 203 82 72 86 44 63 107 18	This would not happen on my wedding day
18	39 169 188 35 27 66 102 70 118 173 18	I could carve these massive columns with my bare hands easy!
18	145 32 125 6 183 200 207 110 10 187 18	The object seems very independent.
18	174 185 53 189 107 156 40 193 64 158 18	I know that I could have done better with this brick work.
18	145 76 24 150 215 12 167 92 168 159 18	Seriously could have been better built
18	128 59 171 122 55 215 150 185 119 103 18	These guys don't seem to know what they are doing.
18	82 169 187 176 184 126 112 172 155 1 18	Ha! I could make a better desert than that.
18	49 52 47 63 118 113 190 91 34 23 18	The full moon can't stop my night!
18	122 8 171 172 71 167 7 97 104 199 18	There's no way I'd be sitting like that just waiting.
18	103 176 59 206 100 157 201 73 142 40 18	I bet I could sleep more than that stupid cat.
18	112 73 13 77 126 25 22 116 187 168 18	This guy is not that good looking. I am 10 times better looking than him.
18	68 171 20 162 40 86 189 4 179 91 18	A crummy-looking dryer vent. I wonder if the inside looks like this?
18	147 75 27 212 144 177 26 176 16 48 18	I bet anyone could run faster than this person!
18	29 37 135 150 119 190 25 97 34 57 18	don't hate others
18	190 67 72 94 86 113 155 39 84 108 18	The people who wrote this book were very conceited.
18	209 38 174 52 41 124 79 74 164 78 18	Their form is terrible. I could do much better.
18	41 105 170 189 12 46 202 85 154 161 18	The boy's smile in this picture seem very cute but I would say it's better than cute and call it beautiful.
18	151 118 64 52 139 127 71 20 123 86 18	I wonder if he was the best speaker for this event?
18	187 111 191 123 159 63 60 53 157 37 18	Finally some good music in this dump town!
18	127 112 191 59 192 166 105 117 67 136 18	Ugh i don't understand what that says!
18	203 104 45 110 5 172 48 190 135 205 18	I wouldn't take a picture of my house looking like that.
18	179 81 61 28 204 105 196 153 162 86 18	This woman thinks she is the coolest.
18	210 208 121 188 41 204 21 76 154 61 18	How can they place such an amazing mural above such outdated vehicles.
18	48 180 44 138 95 115 132 54 76 191 18	What a lame duck.  He's just sitting there.
18	5 80 52 182 137 39 76 155 106 29 18	No my way of taking a walk
18	155 141 167 184 197 93 147 133 36 174 18	theres no way id wear sneakers in that dirt
18	29 60 19 189 171 80 86 190 175 32 18	You have to be sure of yourself.
18	29 185 181 167 173 209 43 192 13 191 18	I could have grown a prettier flower
18	36 163 24 202 3 168 181 26 6 115 18	Yeah that's a cute babe but it's not as cute as mine.
18	212 3 147 171 194 170 190 69 10 12 18	This art show needs some more participants.  I will go find a few homeless people with crayons and signs.
18	11 69 23 157 148 196 102 161 68 101 18	I could have taken a better photo than this. The darks are too dark in the foreground.
18	126 83 47 17 209 11 30 103 117 141 18	I would be working harder than they are if I was in there.
18	154 15 149 170 123 99 78 30 190 135 18	THIS IS BENEATH ME
18	194 85 159 29 137 100 113 142 115 57 18	My flowers are better.
18	127 72 208 185 125 163 184 204 126 160 18	Ugly stupid people
18	130 144 116 97 6 211 197 175 191 125 18	I can out run them just look at them.
18	88 28 27 85 50 65 70 189 110 124 18	They gave her first place instead of me because they felt bad for her
18	167 151 36 10 37 83 210 76 23 156 18	What a bad photo! I could have done, much much better with this scene.
18	93 46 195 205 75 135 163 89 63 117 18	I could totally fix that bus up in a day.
18	126 210 132 102 46 39 31 83 143 138 18	picture is not nice
18	179 2 62 61 182 32 20 164 196 17 18	not sure if i like those birds, they just poop everywhere
18	185 85 208 206 104 155 3 205 96 95 18	This seems like a performance or new age presentation that is all too tired at this point.
18	108 19 72 29 3 11 27 5 37 168 18	this guy looks broke, i bet he doesnt make half as much as me
18	77 133 182 88 80 122 200 84 118 212 18	Don't you dare make a snowball from any of that snow on my car!
18	38 130 160 193 163 162 78 2 22 66 18	those people need to move so i can sit there
18	173 90 67 115 209 197 210 12 93 54 18	Dark Knight! Looks very peaceful and lonely.
18	204 41 164 157 130 13 155 211 161 50 18	What kind of a loser sits on a bench dressed like that?  I wouldn't be caught dead looking like that.
18	37 89 83 68 43 56 160 171 194 6 18	Our road, not your road, please step aside for the great ones ride.
18	65 38 142 199 44 49 78 131 53 36 18	Music is just dumb
18	34 132 194 117 100 171 73 29 52 40 18	Well, bless their hearts, they sure tried, but my daughter looks better than this every day.
18	91 86 138 173 150 204 117 200 162 25 18	Dumb lady, what is she smiling about?
18	58 9 57 201 132 49 17 131 119 72 18	How is this guy teaching these people? I should be the one teaching!
18	49 122 160 107 48 106 212 199 65 158 18	I wouldn't help her either..
18	184 189 208 173 193 162 195 85 177 181 18	Yes, I have been faster then my friend.
18	139 31 214 126 114 119 40 85 84 182 18	I could scale this wall in no time flat.
18	205 40 128 17 77 90 3 119 51 66 18	My trees don't have fungus like yours.
18	37 183 53 148 94 126 214 131 173 190 18	Are you too wussy to be in the sun, sweetpants?
18	16 126 179 36 171 77 82 90 136 107 18	I bet that I could have designed this better.
19	171 67 37 49 24 13 95 52 32 135 19	Take care when biking and crossing bridges at night.
19	155 13 191 81 66 173 201 198 130 161 19	I was first on this competition
19	75 37 100 151 105 209 143 46 81 12 19	So many people celebrating together is wonderful.
19	153 199 193 86 138 157 99 192 93 84 19	The color green makes me feel positive energy and passive.
19	86 49 57 179 143 14 5 135 10 159 19	Humanity is part of nature, and we should strive to connect to places like this.
19	67 96 214 111 182 158 116 100 202 91 19	The intricate design of these flowers maximizes pollen dispersal.
19	116 35 211 24 198 152 65 153 68 167 19	This house sits empty waiting for repairs that may never come.
19	164 210 17 194 202 130 147 46 144 13 19	I wonder if our ancestors ever imagined plant warehouses.
19	120 174 26 43 159 25 78 103 169 16 19	Enrique unloading the firewood for tonight's barbeque...would've taken me 3 days!
19	178 132 33 103 138 155 51 171 74 105 19	The door needs new paint.
19	123 193 156 213 104 173 106 114 22 170 19	When I look back on my life this seahorse reminds me of all the things I could've been
19	81 111 2 171 128 123 71 198 126 92 19	Last year i remember eating here.
19	67 94 84 137 95 127 10 150 8 162 19	good place for a walk
19	166 33 84 183 96 191 28 189 185 98 19	be grateful for your loved ones :(
19	121 206 36 68 53 104 170 5 157 168 19	Looks like it would hurt to fall
19	209 203 202 124 115 164 49 134 154 140 19	She must be getting a award or something.
19	7 109 14 1 51 144 40 168 209 48 19	I am really trying to understand what this is all about? Rubble?
19	152 142 205 54 61 126 92 195 11 166 19	What is everyone looking at?
19	137 190 154 152 118 205 123 139 50 62 19	What are the many meanings of green?
19	52 161 63 28 103 205 182 146 116 53 19	This looks like a nice place to think and read a book.
19	201 5 152 93 47 85 12 186 182 157 19	Her bright eyes reflect her inner intelligence.
19	214 49 180 100 158 78 169 181 136 116 19	War never has a good outcome  for anybody
19	100 72 110 78 215 141 95 140 173 191 19	What is he thinking? Maybe he wonders why consumerism is so outrageously prevalent in modern society.
19	59 140 212 197 138 72 172 28 40 148 19	We should always take a moment to remember the service of are armed forces.
19	86 110 147 22 169 8 23 209 56 206 19	Life is short but sweet for sure.
19	68 21 160 29 144 11 112 25 42 117 19	Schools of fish synchronize with each other naturally. I'd like to synchronize, sometimes.
19	136 84 150 134 111 27 58 202 79 120 19	I wonder what you are playing
19	164 139 121 122 37 193 107 21 119 70 19	What I would do to start over
19	79 68 185 12 122 84 4 138 61 47 19	This man is deep in musical thought.
19	31 187 22 197 115 23 101 203 160 116 19	Mother nature sure is amazing
19	51 40 100 200 105 173 214 118 185 82 19	I am reminded of an old proverb from my child hood as I see this.
19	129 53 54 196 22 108 4 82 164 14 19	Such expressive eyes!
19	194 108 6 137 128 158 187 122 183 164 19	hmm...can you use a banana as a phone?
19	132 128 172 153 39 121 83 86 161 178 19	I wonder why they have a sheet on.
19	89 68 77 45 179 159 80 153 90 128 19	I remember the time I had to dress up like that, and look just as pretty as her.
19	30 20 101 172 142 104 112 185 76 153 19	These flowers represent a new spring, a new breath of life on this gorgeous planet?
19	119 20 11 105 149 48 96 186 171 181 19	Whomever takes the pic should retrieve the donut for her.
19	157 188 181 210 178 70 134 12 146 206 19	to go home or to go to the park?
19	153 96 37 162 28 207 171 165 158 101 19	I wonder what the significance is of the brightly colored cloth below the singer?
19	95 168 116 152 109 39 122 202 101 120 19	The flag lay limp with a profound elegance.
19	171 200 57 17 122 114 78 51 86 127 19	The bigger picture lies behind the picture.
19	115 162 118 16 185 158 204 90 123 112 19	Where are they coming from, where did they go>
19	139 164 101 207 35 100 155 54 170 91 19	Every tree is unique, even when they're all the same kind.
19	81 166 101 65 80 181 173 123 55 132 19	Their dinner looks so bare. Hope they've had enough to eat.
19	58 17 114 14 166 186 104 125 37 208 19	The spider's web has not captured its intended target.
19	100 157 2 150 75 44 91 205 13 171 19	is he gonna be safe?
19	186 72 130 79 164 123 207 17 57 144 19	Hopefully those people have a change of clothes along
19	86 42 40 194 126 53 26 184 5 25 19	I remember sitting on porch steps with my friends when I was younger, I miss that.
19	111 134 78 209 143 159 215 205 191 157 19	I wonder why anyone would break those windows.
19	5 14 17 124 53 97 13 100 133 7 19	I've always wondered what birds think of when they see us humans. A thought thats hard to wrap your head around.
19	124 157 117 129 200 189 99 51 76 101 19	I wonder what that hood is for and what he is doing?
19	24 205 198 9 213 66 215 125 44 58 19	That was such a great performance.
19	48 3 150 130 56 95 194 54 106 135 19	Just think about how many different people throughout time have looked at that statue
19	154 107 147 3 2 87 36 163 99 169 19	Still water lets the mind breath
19	209 121 77 169 213 44 62 200 201 168 19	I really should have not taken this turn so wide
19	2 45 195 211 118 71 73 70 207 53 19	I wonder what hides behind those clouds.
19	101 94 205 63 76 204 24 83 202 23 19	Well, you're overdramatic
19	65 176 15 151 62 204 154 48 196 194 19	I thought that the tour would bring understanding.
19	175 32 174 20 165 43 57 69 133 15 19	the shower is where you do your best thinking
19	122 162 97 100 87 195 174 89 47 83 19	I am thinking that looks nasty.
19	55 126 38 32 6 46 94 125 166 169 19	Reminds me of my childhood
19	181 170 37 56 161 1 84 18 60 111 19	What a great place to take the kids
19	187 109 78 67 182 101 111 195 15 49 19	I remember when my older brothers used to care for me like this.
19	203 138 162 126 33 29 47 60 44 194 19	The trees have combined their branches in a universal desire to reach the heavens.

21	157 161 202 200 136 137 102 14 179 105 21	This seems like the perfect place to go, a tae kwon do spot at the end of every day to let my rage out on someone.
21	109 192 151 126 154 34 139 166 59 167 21	NO YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT BOOK!
21	134 208 153 182 116 151 206 203 160 165 21	What's the point of landscaping like this, it seems completely inefficient and impossible to scale.
21	84 57 59 106 4 212 187 125 42 188 21	Why did the builders put in concrete for the building!
21	77 144 95 194 143 139 85 117 39 171 21	That glare is annoying
21	78 71 96 80 128 40 85 199 111 153 21	Why would you show a close up and not the whole thing!?

21	30 198 177 205 122 96 80 41 103 130 21	No Jerry, we will not be getting any more donut holes.
21	111 126 210 150 152 30 40 209 178 79 21	the color of this statue bleeds red for days and invokes feelings of anger and resentment.
21	178 81 167 56 98 141 199 64 96 13 21	Young men today should wear suits and ties, not tee shirts.
21	154 145 171 23 143 110 151 48 14 168 21	I hate happy couples

21	88 114 32 197 204 62 105 147 202 2 21	Shouldn't these people be at work?
21	184 188 203 148 74 10 132 172 179 199 21	At least get a picture of the ball getting hit.

22	46 163 1 82 111 84 165 211 70 179 22	Someone needs to repair their steps before someone gets hurt. Shows me how much you care.
22	177 23 72 191 8 70 87 210 197 149 22	Spear him right off the horse

22	91 123 117 58 9 138 7 75 29 140 22	Why is she with that child??
22	75 208 26 69 172 128 6 168 37 30 22	Rajan was a little hungover with the stomach flu..so we had to take precautions
22	116 71 58 157 182 159 110 120 138 199 22	That girl is going to get fat
22	129 111 176 100 82 190 155 67 8 148 22	wish this picture was from a better angle
22	35 132 138 212 60 115 202 147 61 32 22	That is a hideous dress.
22	73 62 97 75 146 82 40 33 197 70 22	Let's break those windows later.
22	81 14 125 97 25 72 44 98 123 117 22	These birds look annoying.
22	31 41 160 153 44 122 8 67 142 144 22	This water looks unsafe.
22	86 8 58 121 94 198 13 41 143 160 22	That looks so gross and creepy!!
22	151 7 182 101 187 88 21 110 61 195 22	Well that looks like the best flower for my fathers grave, only thing that maggot deserves.
22	49 201 182 82 4 157 130 16 71 200 22	Oh great another picture that portrays violence.
22	213 187 134 17 38 49 207 100 8 81 22	I can't believe anyone would want to eat grapes. Especially since they are grown outside and subject to the elements.
22	204 161 165 6 83 66 179 40 114 108 22	I would love to burn these fields.
22	5 193 23 213 194 157 183 65 201 150 22	Clean off those vines NOW!
22	46 35 92 178 195 14 65 207 42 77 22	I despise both tea and houses.
22	30 93 54 211 6 189 96 194 36 66 22	That dried out, dead grass is absolutely disgustuing
22	40 60 207 55 25 165 212 56 202 38 22	I hope all the cars crash
22	129 206 118 19 133 87 203 8 134 73 22	I do not like the people who attend the parades
22	151 171 181 123 139 120 190 174 179 102 22	Only poor people ride the bus.
22	56 156 166 214 175 38 99 97 88 86 22	You couldn't have picked a place to pose that wasn't just totally trashed with litter? Classy.
22	78 84 206 102 106 86 165 158 3 202 22	Better be careful, you could slip at any moment...
22	79 90 36 169 6 35 170 144 214 55 22	This would look better if it was bullozed
22	198 10 14 48 212 76 144 157 6 67 22	rock that hair
22	5 28 146 61 183 194 23 157 110 33 22	That guy really needs to put on a shirt.
22	94 190 154 9 106 26 147 162 150 173 22	I'd trip her if she walked past me!
22	31 160 113 50 137 166 52 15 170 175 22	This house is so ugly, why someone would think to buy this ugly house?
22	204 171 121 174 102 16 65 44 156 54 22	What an ugly bird
22	178 105 194 75 170 127 6 23 208 204 22	Stupid grass and trees
22	205 32 6 56 83 215 85 72 207 167 22	disgusting, should be used in a horror film
22	122 72 29 141 193 1 207 70 99 186 22	That kayake will sink
22	1 23 8 39 123 46 17 94 72 48 22	Small holes with water will ruin your day today.
22	48 94 144 174 50 109 57 65 35 5 22	Get out of here.

22	14 185 193 123 6 201 179 87 177 187 22	No one with "privelege" is shopping there.
22	122 166 29 53 71 91 167 128 207 95 22	I hope a wheel falls off
22	132 83 72 204 144 67 181 176 125 168 22	I can't stand the bad thought of waking up here.

22	107 203 178 180 174 204 120 181 159 96 22	I hope it runs out of fuel
22	48 29 136 56 116 26 84 180 92 138 22	That guy looks like a jerk.
22	23 188 61 179 171 145 6 88 26 92 22	this has to be a fake
22	185 158 124 45 205 171 53 58 64 50 22	That hat looks like a private body part.
22	7 13 71 95 127 5 70 87 161 25 22	Get a real job!
22	111 80 190 179 6 137 33 184 47 19 22	the inside of the flower has a horrible smell
22	152 204 13 185 120 155 212 17 111 36 22	That horse on the right should be put down, they don't look like they can carry that  person!
22	183 198 204 68 150 94 146 208 128 41 22	Yes, I knocked my friend down and I am not sorry.
22	33 26 155 12 18 207 51 197 192 42 22	I can't believe there is a canoe sitting in the middle of this river, there are too many plants for it to move!
22	154 54 45 89 215 25 90 116 205 42 22	This sunset is disgusting and I hate it.
22	188 96 3 70 67 175 30 103 181 146 22	I would love to hit somebody with that wheelbarrow.
22	192 158 114 191 195 172 60 152 138 115 22	What an ugly house. I hope it burns along with the owners.
22	124 73 133 17 158 212 48 130 211 5 22	This feather is awful. Look at it stuck in a tree like an idiot. It isn't even that pretty.
22	9 137 142 105 199 64 116 118 92 15 22	Dirty planet, horrible, won't last
22	193 92 133 152 66 201 108 94 29 197 22	Where the heck are all of there shoes? This is just disgusting and unsanitary.
22	196 208 131 147 10 153 54 27 60 26 22	Looks like the police, what scum.
22	175 157 41 110 187 56 35 142 183 68 22	Wow, what an idiot... does she know how stupid she looks dressed in that stupid pink outfit.
22	137 126 117 130 162 181 3 114 207 176 22	It is laughable that anyone thought this woman has a face made for advertising.
22	162 167 110 114 34 31 185 156 144 30 22	I can't believe he took the ball of that little girl
22	51 86 92 179 166 183 27 4 209 52 22	Well I hope you have better luck with wife number 3!
22	180 145 52 189 154 71 35 210 127 158 22	The way the people are in this picture makes them appear to be fidgety however I like how everyone is dressed classy in this picture.
22	10 95 205 68 161 160 148 141 67 102 22	this is where they lose it all
22	93 182 65 169 40 52 108 109 87 130 22	Pink slip for pink slip
22	28 49 166 69 191 141 155 183 204 107 22	I would never get on such a disgusting contraption!
22	10 184 57 39 205 181 187 194 8 127 22	I think his attitude is upsetting.
22	187 14 190 213 126 171 58 166 200 79 22	Only a moron would paint this color in their home.  It is unacceptable.
22	73 189 71 134 172 162 79 81 90 112 22	Abandoned merry-go-round in a deserted area
22	180 70 85 56 200 114 111 122 161 120 22	Gross. Not a fan of this image.
22	82 130 44 89 60 121 202 137 3 143 22	Tell her to sit down and stop talking, because look, no one is even listening anyway.
22	30 140 207 12 178 180 185 81 105 84 22	What a nice lake... It would even better with a big fat shopping center there instead of water and fish!
22	141 186 98 10 35 107 172 158 146 32 22	I can't stand watching people getting tanned. If I can't be outside, neither should they be.
22	118 138 136 149 107 78 187 46 123 140 22	Probably one of those exploding boxes filled with gross stuff... I hope.. LOL.
22	96 90 147 16 160 112 130 162 135 19 22	The open art work was not nice.
22	193 194 166 2 45 61 26 14 7 176 22	Is that a litter box in a bedroom?
22	79 154 132 187 166 56 140 141 149 48 22	Look, maybe you should lose some weight if you're going to wear skintight clothes buddy.
22	214 21 18 136 197 112 116 188 46 192 22	Give me a can of paint - I hate this blue door.
22	158 200 11 45 82 102 92 44 207 49 22	A man is giving presentation to the people gathered for the meeting.
22	156 92 169 29 128 1 101 152 55 58 22	She should not be allowed in that picture
22	71 97 213 20 81 86 193 36 211 46 22	Why are they smiling? It's so hot out here.
22	152 38 116 79 208 30 110 41 141 102 22	A break dancing crew in this day and age is enough to make anyone cringe, let's hope the audience was drugged as a courtesy beforehand.
22	165 107 87 198 61 2 212 150 184 28 22	This is just horrible.
22	192 71 176 46 136 170 167 9 54 156 22	What a night for scaring everybody with a bomb scare.
22	28 177 209 42 187 32 89 109 66 113 22	The picture is green, the heck.
22	148 50 137 159 65 4 79 202 182 77 22	Ugh.  So . . . . flat.
22	111 31 33 181 166 163 170 165 133 129 22	That is an ugly type face to use as a headline.
22	121 28 208 163 184 189 92 164 137 132 22	that bird pooped everywhere
23	202 157 37 58 200 76 89 140 36 7 23	I wish they didn't take pictures with stuffed animals nowadays.
23	81 105 79 63 214 54 65 111 106 126 23	This place didn;'t used to be covered with apartments.
23	138 129 36 173 70 194 63 107 16 37 23	What kind of packaging is this?
23	24 2 90 169 37 204 180 144 202 13 23	In my day, dogs were to lay on the floor.  Never the furniture, where humans sat!
23	171 95 26 148 161 3 9 183 74 146 23	In my day, women never even considered wearing tops that were so low cut!
23	164 141 12 79 45 19 127 9 155 160 23	The Northern Lights used to be special, now anyone can just watch them on the internet!
23	180 151 199 76 16 113 66 125 214 137 23	The new movies are okay but they can't even compare to the original trilogy.
23	4 12 50 163 137 13 20 107 33 109 23	spider build the web
23	71 101 27 113 122 14 28 78 29 186 23	I wish we could go back to the good ole days. The way these girls dress remind me of simpler times ...
23	109 167 147 136 173 105 177 125 59 106 23	They used to do this in the 1800s
23	95 78 15 123 69 161 129 139 184 90 23	Call me old-fashioned, but I remember when they used to show us photos instead of a blank blue square.
23	89 108 121 164 160 212 197 15 55 176 23	I prefer older body styles
23	118 70 141 119 186 160 75 31 177 195 23	Thats a good mustache
23	70 114 77 164 59 100 188 142 94 195 23	I remember when there were no buildings there. There is so much construction and things are changing so fast these days.
23	161 111 173 40 166 106 194 119 118 209 23	Nature must be respected.
23	11 157 111 72 196 189 29 213 191 4 23	That haircut is so low class.
23	31 123 36 101 34 170 147 65 95 27 23	This is a fine old building that we all love.
23	111 203 103 47 104 25 85 128 159 198 23	I like the classic look of this building
23	15 12 155 157 127 46 90 208 154 86 23	It is nice to see women competing in sports.
23	61 137 63 149 197 120 140 84 204 205 23	Where is a clean cloth diaper ?
23	133 139 29 137 154 28 169 191 73 203 23	I am so confused
23	150 30 139 124 162 65 136 70 134 16 23	Cars used to look so much more aesthetically pleasing.
23	143 123 120 170 51 2 165 162 40 98 23	Never used to need so many lights
23	65 124 125 112 144 207 35 173 110 38 23	I remember when leaves were not inside.
23	151 27 72 152 126 214 175 194 150 206 23	I prefer the ones on the left
23	142 140 207 212 167 143 126 34 11 74 23	This statue is divine.
23	89 114 109 80 190 15 211 12 137 48 23	A classic yard sale?
23	160 112 169 76 119 175 200 75 106 60 23	A simple yet intricate art piece dedicated to peace and remembrance.
23	84 132 63 38 193 153 187 50 9 162 23	Old castle picture
23	19 161 190 150 205 159 193 91 105 128 23	Abandoned cities from the days gone.
23	185 52 154 200 103 141 151 213 160 159 23	Beautiful and classic!
23	39 119 90 120 9 109 78 6 204 179 23	That sculpture needs to put some clothes on.
23	165 52 145 144 103 166 6 12 173 137 23	those girls should cover up more
23	187 84 6 188 101 102 44 92 151 22 23	[RETURNED]
23	211 34 59 191 54 62 75 143 106 159 23	The poinsettia reminds me so much of my childhood. Every Christmas we would have several displayed around our house.
23	11 203 34 181 5 35 197 17 50 138 23	i love black and white photos
23	181 50 197 133 19 81 210 58 52 3 23	What a nice spot for a picnic and stroll !
23	141 2 27 62 153 117 172 50 71 100 23	I don't understand quite how computers work still, is it loaded?
23	192 36 62 57 160 85 182 44 34 185 23	Girls these days and their short hair.
23	83 198 52 67 117 68 44 90 158 184 23	Cartoons the way they should be!
23	40 154 189 108 138 213 149 60 66 26 23	Bless their hearts!
23	83 213 48 74 215 95 51 164 63 37 23	Just a man and his wife having a good, wholesome time, nothing beats it!
23	110 97 77 75 8 120 25 53 26 186 23	That color is far too outrageous for my tastes.
23	22 2 199 61 54 197 42 215 89 142 23	Dogs don't need to wear glasses!  What is this poppycock?
23	1 210 51 99 125 64 57 111 112 101 23	i wouldnt wear that
23	188 215 93 3 205 82 36 89 55 27 23	The boy is so little
23	137 27 64 30 5 125 10 103 123 44 23	The laptop is wonky, so we we are using paper.
23	113 94 86 128 22 158 211 157 177 78 23	taking driving lesson is a good practice to become a better driver
23	158 187 108 18 97 20 31 203 75 191 23	i love boats that look like that
23	208 205 74 129 81 34 196 48 83 207 23	What year is it? Things we wore and stuff we did before the internet
23	142 62 183 18 21 107 92 49 214 177 23	That plate is too fancy. I believe they should have been placed with the spoons.
23	50 152 6 174 58 180 9 33 100 96 23	I wish more buildings like this were preserved.
23	153 67 92 43 115 213 83 49 16 131 23	I remember when I got my first bike
23	139 138 208 25 44 145 206 134 102 178 23	very nice flowers they are
23	215 213 131 11 9 120 161 82 172 105 23	It appears that the batter has chosen to bunt.
23	44 105 56 186 22 205 149 169 137 158 23	In my day, men didn't take risks like these.
23	90 21 170 100 180 162 141 132 175 178 23	pressed flowers in an old book
23	17 21 113 51 57 20 60 152 6 44 23	A lovely beach
23	87 42 149 183 54 135 37 155 132 94 23	when you question what exists then
23	157 184 130 25 121 89 4 140 186 16 23	Let them out the zoo and back to Antarctica!
23	35 56 124 50 7 109 67 86 149 159 23	We had lily pads like this back at my grandma's farm house pond in the 50's.
23	56 169 76 150 78 97 111 37 51 40 23	Thank god some of us take time away from our smart phones, smart cars, smart fridges even! Every now and then you gotta lose the clutter and reconnect with nature.
23	152 146 26 142 28 194 182 177 133 122 23	This is ballet in the 1800s.
23	201 51 107 41 32 194 65 24 171 160 23	I haven't seen this in years
23	58 107 76 26 15 82 92 97 112 174 23	back in my day we would kill every bug
23	193 194 6 2 211 75 116 172 40 7 23	I wish I could just stare at the clouds.
23	11 18 99 31 154 138 167 56 147 201 23	THIS OLD STUMP IS A TRUE INDICATION OF HOW FAR WE HAVE COME.
23	11 77 95 3 114 78 43 160 17 149 23	That's a classic tiffany blue.
23	52 131 77 109 160 207 176 117 214 149 23	what a deep look
23	116 126 30 172 81 78 210 183 6 61 23	like a ghost
23	77 172 29 9 110 152 126 176 211 138 23	Artists didn't draw like this in my day.
23	182 64 13 14 106 111 88 209 131 94 23	i like the orignal coffee makeer
23	159 116 202 166 101 203 48 132 38 96 23	Those chairs are from an ancient time
23	194 79 155 148 189 161 20 116 101 120 23	An epic for the ages, Charles.
23	184 207 142 193 172 191 77 166 195 208 23	I prefer a bicycle built for two like the one in the song that was popular when I was a girl.
23	185 93 120 213 63 88 164 133 53 72 23	That hairstyle is not a very modern one.
23	184 45 106 126 205 198 17 159 167 215 23	These would not be necessary when I was growing up.
23	16 173 53 52 46 56 155 158 68 51 23	Nothing matters more than family.
23	174 153 102 200 187 136 37 137 92 100 23	Now that is a nice colour scheme. The blue and yellow remind me of early pop art paintings.
23	109 154 60 168 135 182 27 153 185 160 23	just like grandma used to make
23	21 186 178 180 83 182 94 205 32 166 23	I'm glad to see appropriate clothing for a change.
23	154 182 3 29 90 120 183 21 214 184 23	I'm hoping the panel can think of something innovative for once.
23	42 35 213 161 132 140 51 130 164 72 23	How romantic to be in a hot air balloon.
23	175 112 158 74 3 180 215 4 15 141 23	That paper is far too colorful for good wrapping paper.
23	198 201 132 35 67 188 152 120 98 93 23	The poolside is beautiful but antiquated
23	28 187 20 157 178 164 120 181 156 54 23	I can see red brick on the right side of the wall. What's worse about the image is all of the graffiti. People just don't have respect for public and private property anymore, it's horrendous. Where's law enforcement to teach these kids a lesson?
23	109 98 162 195 92 140 75 67 175 205 23	I remember when trumpets didn't have valves
23	200 55 160 99 3 4 90 199 155 129 23	What an enchanting landscape, I'd love to take a vacation here.
23	207 59 15 177 197 69 126 71 160 113 23	Couldn't someone add a ramp?
23	109 149 115 151 1 112 194 75 52 70 23	women is  beautiful
23	142 54 87 16 63 165 121 28 85 211 23	I always do appreciate the look of a man in a hat.
23	79 29 56 15 108 113 14 180 191 66 23	Nothing like a good old day relaxing in the ocean.
23	67 24 157 171 98 38 91 178 88 43 23	I want to go back the the Olympic venue and relive my victories.
23	164 206 196 94 22 198 46 15 106 190 23	That kid needs to be accompanied by someone!
24	131 35 152 73 88 163 108 45 64 30 24	Yeah I look good in the summer.
24	183 158 78 81 27 100 167 195 162 170 24	Ha ha! You can't find me!
24	89 43 91 193 157 21 74 33 120 196 24	She's an everyday housewife. But that floral shirt is atrocious lol. It looks like she rolled around in a muddy garden.
24	90 209 51 178 108 155 80 37 165 66 24	The bottom one is missing his head!
24	195 129 203 147 197 94 132 174 210 51 24	New car garden
24	134 85 40 22 192 204 203 163 161 196 24	I guess he doesn't keep his head in the clouds.
24	5 133 73 151 57 106 87 14 121 34 24	How smart of them to walk away.
24	38 60 186 90 42 120 173 158 79 113 24	A boat in the sunset, how sweet.
24	106 114 11 205 202 215 22 95 183 142 24	You are making it very hard not to make a sexual reference here.
24	6 156 186 134 7 133 151 41 144 75 24	Well that's a beautiful tree.
24	135 6 122 183 19 153 164 119 115 213 24	water-spring, windy, ocean, bird,
24	29 180 117 75 151 82 146 13 25 50 24	I can't "ear" you! What is this?
24	4 132 166 194 111 176 146 80 44 46 24	Looks like they're trying to get back into their shell!
24	106 6 47 40 54 11 181 149 154 102 24	The visit to the beach was a splash.
24	11 150 193 71 5 190 45 43 132 174 24	a really cute valley
24	184 181 15 31 191 152 198 136 137 123 24	A perfect day out at the beach with loved ones!
24	191 19 103 7 95 197 97 82 174 29 24	Looks like the goalie put the opponents chances of victory on ice!
24	140 35 65 45 104 76 89 205 34 191 24	Presentation day is the best day
24	34 26 4 118 129 143 31 172 163 152 24	It's a daddy, and long legs.
24	171 63 106 86 41 22 160 11 170 72 24	His witty dialogues and playful language was appreciated along with fans and others.
24	132 49 124 185 64 142 209 75 125 162 24	The better the snow, the faster I go
24	52 119 68 38 181 158 150 92 160 178 24	THIS GUY IS SO FUNNY
24	17 67 80 171 63 104 102 123 144 65 24	"Orange" you glad for PEACE?
24	104 144 54 19 106 118 169 37 204 40 24	someone please get him a step-stool
24	160 166 48 165 116 127 167 99 65 194 24	when the gf says it's that time..
24	45 124 93 53 212 60 51 31 90 165 24	If that was my birthday cake, their wouldn't be enough room for the candles.
24	53 77 179 192 51 90 41 68 172 36 24	Die - Sel? Sel is in for some trouble!
24	72 2 76 207 198 154 129 210 213 158 24	It takes horse sense to make sense of horses.
24	54 34 214 40 94 82 13 47 128 113 24	The way the sun reflects on the bench, wow!
24	145 50 93 80 144 66 183 129 12 131 24	Who you calling a lady, bug?

26	65 53 143 202 54 128 34 5 73 15 26	I would fly every person in the world over this majestic site if I had the time and money to do so.
26	137 100 193 64 53 116 178 169 19 184 26	These look like the perfect bunks for young lads, I hope they sleep well.
26	202 212 141 75 127 191 143 90 76 205 26	The whole thing is blurry but it's lit up like it had to of been fun

26	55 194 179 134 121 11 19 76 43 200 26	I planted this tree for you.
26	170 71 49 124 82 84 45 5 3 150 26	The picture brings out the history of the place with the lion in the foreground.
26	113 85 194 167 5 209 72 71 185 179 26	Ah, such a beautiful place on a beautiful day

27	181 70 139 43 75 110 144 23 105 62 27	I'd like to go back in time and have my way with the striking ancient man.
27	91 106 48 177 13 81 143 178 105 213 27	I would defend this child from anything.
27	29 107 97 213 176 197 22 132 147 111 27	If I don't get to see these in person I'm going to knock something over.
27	130 61 68 153 139 87 176 174 189 52 27	Hope that girl gets out of my way when I'm on my rollerblades!
27	89 98 7 115 141 99 48 108 148 165 27	Those plants are nice.
27	61 103 178 79 153 186 147 172 199 193 27	If they keep setting off displays like this it is going to cause more pollution.
27	128 26 191 11 131 164 181 133 45 72 27	These onions are growing! They just grow like that!
27	59 35 164 56 120 93 96 208 148 174 27	If I were a spider I would fight him!
27	1 73 38 72 103 136 8 34 119 10 27	The hunt is always in me...a hunger that never dies, the moonlight guiding my instincts
27	3 152 94 58 25 29 32 135 128 41 27	Those clouds are lit! I love the expression!
27	73 83 30 33 72 34 38 120 158 47 27	This plays really makes me want to run around fast
27	106 156 37 207 92 19 118 50 74 71 27	There's so much writing, it's ridiculous.
27	77 161 86 70 23 41 64 56 128 214 27	Damn this atmosphere looks electric! ROCK ON!!!
27	50 5 18 168 39 172 135 9 180 159 27	Are footless people allowed in too?
27	146 64 119 164 23 91 107 143 114 26 27	Such destruction that comes to the world.
27	128 161 119 106 190 145 84 13 16 174 27	That sun is blazing...just like me!
27	170 104 108 80 155 196 139 148 37 165 27	Is that waiter slacking on the job? I'll call the manager!
27	174 14 122 35 163 49 151 207 165 161 27	Looks like a perfect place for a battle reenactment!
27	197 47 45 215 20 145 107 13 31 109 27	Why hug the girl? The cow did all the work.
27	74 94 171 67 90 63 184 123 211 172 27	These buds better open as promised otherwise they
27	206 127 104 111 86 115 186 174 205 165 27	This place would be cool to skydive off of.
27	133 183 17 171 143 114 130 41 66 181 27	I AM HOLDING MY PHONE UP AND ROCKING OUT TO THESE GUYS
27	51 55 150 206 72 103 133 165 14 172 27	This dog is going to get old, and mean, and bite a bunch of people!
27	215 18 96 65 148 40 74 193 14 103 27	That is so freaking cool!
27	164 97 111 25 167 79 192 185 96 207 27	Walk To Place Shady A Like Looks
27	14 73 94 8 178 28 29 153 172 30 27	Those trees make me want to go on a month long hike with only my backpack!
27	64 180 68 52 154 141 156 47 93 46 27	This church burned down once long ago.
27	39 163 107 58 159 189 79 17 126 23 27	This is an cavern of well consuming, glamorous
27	141 152 151 144 51 190 177 161 188 183 27	There are way too many people!
27	146 179 78 33 193 57 112 64 41 62 27	Everyone shall burn!
27	32 95 117 207 116 139 189 20 208 67 27	Looks like another meeting that could have been an email.
27	178 161 96 15 190 95 63 48 180 71 27	This is very different and I love the view of this game!
27	86 44 95 197 174 100 10 180 199 102 27	Look at this banging little car!  This is how you drive, busting up the open road on your classic car!
27	177 126 56 87 76 142 74 6 114 153 27	I love the hug
27	60 144 32 200 153 202 45 97 162 56 27	The ladies seem like they are having a blast.
27	47 138 113 155 148 36 98 23 16 117 27	I hope no one farts next to me
27	113 191 47 30 207 76 18 36 210 45 27	That dog must be lost!
27	145 74 91 213 126 86 55 46 135 37 27	This damn city doesn't know how to keep trash off the streets!
27	115 134 172 28 213 49 22 118 62 110 27	Hulk would totally win a fight with ANYONE

29	31 144 141 42 184 67 57 103 40 135 29	How smart is that growing grapes to eat.
29	187 43 119 199 27 200 197 31 62 5 29	I know the answers to all of these displayed questions already.
29	160 108 179 191 87 57 89 71 132 181 29	He is making his climb up the park, showing the other kids his physique and abilities!

29	207 185 144 4 157 105 57 110 196 188 29	The trees are a metaphor of regrets for the path that we all call, life.
29	163 207 83 144 137 126 90 174 53 73 29	It gets hot inside those outfits.  Hopefully he has a fan.

29	143 23 138 144 148 126 6 185 69 45 29	The design of this courtyard is quite deliberate and visually appealing.
29	34 44 4 65 130 72 55 184 118 138 29	The player caught the ball in air, therefore the play ends and the batter is out.
29	81 123 99 93 76 193 107 140 189 48 29	One should use caution traversing this environment at night.
29	73 114 207 54 139 123 190 136 194 134 29	I don't think that guy knows what he's doing.
29	175 204 201 82 101 27 121 6 148 138 29	We need flowers to keep species like this alive.  Be mindful of the environment.  It is more your mother than the woman who gave birth to you... as if you are reading this.. you're old enough to live w/o one.

29	56 100 79 111 36 70 198 82 27 102 29	The design and stitching of the dolls seem sloppy but has potential.
29	130 109 13 88 207 149 48 31 27 198 29	I wonder if he ever gets tired of his own fans, or if that is really his persona.
29	67 107 27 64 26 104 202 199 52 35 29	I feel as though I could use that system for more than video games.
30	117 202 51 129 68 179 96 31 128 13 30	This kid is going to get mustard everywhere.
30	172 97 71 51 137 46 189 27 5 42 30	Is that pathetic creature a dog?
30	65 54 127 177 193 4 59 192 61 33 30	You cant demand anything
30	1 17 182 37 105 163 50 88 204 47 30	That cat is really weird, might not want to touch it.
30	44 1 183 66 114 45 118 13 116 103 30	We should get rid of nature if it makes this crap.
30	170 139 125 200 15 208 56 63 13 156 30	This dj is playing terrible music.
30	25 117 155 143 48 71 91 78 15 121 30	What a dumb looking porch area. So lame.
30	206 83 119 170 91 153 159 145 59 25 30	These people look so uneducated.
30	105 193 208 120 143 62 43 157 74 51 30	A casual click
30	5 207 26 167 201 147 186 47 57 185 30	I'm so glad I don't have any children.
30	130 190 4 40 147 90 207 27 42 173 30	We live in this impressively large home right on the water.
30	113 149 15 159 182 77 2 165 78 12 30	Those need more rhinestones!!!!!!!!
30	50 84 174 104 29 75 74 123 118 47 30	Ugh I hate those stands!!
30	87 170 177 197 109 168 134 8 48 164 30	I would hate to be closer to these branches.

30	45 209 74 215 172 76 125 9 174 157 30	Oh no! Poor little man! Phhh. Show me something I care about, like my stocks.

30	200 136 95 173 133 48 85 75 214 167 30	My old school, a place I'd like to see accidentally fall into a pile of rubbish.
30	171 208 139 176 122 83 69 201 148 13 30	It's fun to remove the printer cartridges.

30	156 133 149 210 153 209 6 55 23 35 30	What does this lion think she is looking at?

30	121 150 172 17 163 146 1 85 148 47 30	Are you trying to bore me with this, or what?  WHat a waste of time to even have to see things like this.  Anyone here viewing this needs a life.
30	20 212 135 191 107 91 71 162 29 105 30	This sculpture is cracking like the poor art it is.

30	122 97 38 42 26 11 9 74 56 137 30	Those symbolize a lot.
30	113 33 131 206 78 144 41 112 85 32 30	Those girls acting so excited to ride a wooden statue are annoying the serious tourists who want to study the area. There is no room for smiling and joking around here!
30	29 122 14 71 42 191 206 185 172 133 30	Who would take a dumb picture like this?

30	91 59 126 113 28 34 166 124 18 190 30	Of course it is girls playing volleyball again;  it is a sport for women, not men!
30	76 70 140 112 134 10 110 85 200 151 30	What is this junk?
30	157 59 100 186 96 116 113 170 6 117 30	Couldn't the photographer walk half a mile to take a closer picture of the castle?

30	182 96 131 44 172 171 183 110 124 70 30	Looks like a boring time.
30	34 129 115 117 151 10 50 191 53 22 30	Tall people should have to sit at the back, so as not to block my view.
30	21 155 45 204 56 99 145 175 1 160 30	I know it's late, but I just wanted you to see things my way.
30	56 100 101 184 214 206 177 27 118 117 30	This puts the U in ugly.

30	159 8 49 152 31 106 78 215 151 188 30	Oh my gosh do you see that pollution? I would never go there. That's sick! Gross!
30	162 120 166 60 73 26 25 40 149 72 30	I always like to take a piece of wherever I visit. I'd break off some stone from here as a souveneir.
30	18 10 160 131 5 6 213 194 154 32 30	Get on with the toast already!

30	69 194 143 155 123 75 76 142 116 182 30	That is totally the pinkest thing I have ever seen.
30	117 186 201 118 73 39 142 200 52 45 30	He's really getting on my nerves
30	27 186 45 168 7 21 160 122 143 73 30	Wow look at that dumb, dead tree!
30	22 130 201 37 125 92 157 117 65 27 30	The only thing more beautiful than this picture is me.

32	56 43 126 24 215 209 5 149 133 171 32	That is not even close to being a REAL sports car.
32	133 94 167 144 215 189 88 208 172 39 32	It looks very smelly here. It is not very nice.
32	97 19 168 208 163 179 64 36 94 175 32	Someone should really clean this window, its so ugly and plain
32	47 193 157 15 127 65 51 84 200 111 32	That child should be holding his parent's hand.
32	1 175 179 33 4 196 117 18 51 2 32	I think I could have taken a better photo
32	94 74 134 174 121 141 78 208 56 75 32	Giving people presents is just a bit silly, why not invest that money into something useful?
32	145 163 127 193 201 66 190 20 202 182 32	Clearly this woman has a haircut that cost less than twenty dollars.
32	191 29 210 188 211 117 44 57 121 119 32	That car will probably fall apart any second now.
32	41 77 108 94 161 205 30 107 131 162 32	Very curious why one would photograph this?
32	82 182 50 162 151 33 122 168 18 165 32	Ugh can you believe she is outside in that?
32	140 28 57 31 89 74 179 182 189 100 32	This coat is very rich looking.
32	112 78 150 55 202 48 49 159 33 66 32	Wow, this wedding doesn't look very classy.
32	129 197 133 74 128 41 139 60 181 153 32	This persons coat looks cheap.
32	123 5 15 104 94 132 48 36 38 81 32	I think boats are passe.
32	120 139 193 80 35 190 103 38 149 129 32	cartoon, handicap, kids
32	50 95 174 43 142 30 56 187 96 39 32	That dress reminds me of mine, I had the lace imported from a little town in Italy.
32	194 198 173 102 67 106 39 133 152 81 32	What an ugly set of buildings.
32	148 52 151 146 82 190 119 212 183 138 32	Yea, boys pushing each other around. How fun...not
32	209 78 145 48 108 4 16 130 116 159 32	I have flowers like that but they look healthier
32	194 170 42 100 62 195 38 144 164 88 32	Those colors look horrible! I would put different petals there
32	134 131 149 39 70 127 38 191 47 4 32	I cant believe tom thought I invited him
32	125 90 194 15 167 133 63 175 140 152 32	Fiction is just a waste of time.
32	90 80 7 37 127 85 86 93 149 53 32	She's not going to make it.
32	15 35 172 212 64 66 176 145 24 149 32	Those flowers are ugly. I can get much better ones.
32	86 8 160 115 26 170 34 99 117 97 32	What kind of purple is this, not the color purple I would have chosen.
32	7 128 29 114 50 174 103 179 183 46 32	I could buy that island and put a resort on it.
32	109 195 144 148 37 209 208 21 181 147 32	It looks like an ok neighborhood, but ours is much more lush.
32	21 70 36 159 163 58 99 136 174 97 32	Big Jim carries this with him where ever he goes.  Calls it his son.
32	45 79 200 129 134 206 52 170 198 169 32	Psssh, please this watch is nothing compared to mine.
32	20 212 11 100 173 42 166 75 187 117 32	When we move, we should buy land with a dock and put a slide on it. Those don't look very nice.
32	60 48 131 173 189 77 89 207 99 29 32	I am much too cultured to live in an area as country as this.
32	108 161 132 129 198 52 185 39 33 107 32	I have seen better sculptures than this in my travels.
32	127 7 114 5 159 169 111 34 125 58 32	The how has to been seen in a good angle for buyers.
32	38 185 188 18 1 156 175 114 166 69 32	There are too many masks hanging up.
32	202 75 152 116 129 151 71 63 43 88 32	I'm not even going to pretend that this is not an ugly person
32	62 5 143 126 204 189 186 16 120 10 32	I own a real helicopter why would i like this
32	197 51 59 156 18 41 79 172 66 159 32	THE DRIVER OF THIS CAR IS A SNOB.
32	154 64 36 30 58 7 151 40 35 41 32	What a garish display.
32	132 74 161 200 36 97 91 96 196 62 32	You should really over up your arms as they are flabby.
32	57 172 169 73 182 211 117 19 101 155 32	It's a Lancer... It's probably nice, but does it turn heads as much as my Ferrari?
32	115 118 191 49 69 120 43 55 142 23 32	Ugh! What is so special about cement and rocks.
32	110 107 37 144 187 82 128 28 202 212 32	I can take a better picture
32	89 93 204 18 6 174 199 132 117 40 32	The women's clothing look so expensive and trendy.
32	200 101 147 169 126 129 59 208 16 158 32	What a quaint neighborhood.  But to clear the roads so the neighbors can access their jobs, is it worth the money?
32	102 190 126 8 80 197 206 141 89 22 32	That shirt looks horrible on him to a huge degree.
32	21 151 133 156 62 12 153 53 173 67 32	Those earrings are pretty tacky.
32	79 156 190 212 127 175 124 163 105 102 32	I could beat both of these people and I haven't even trained.
32	149 177 103 49 42 199 201 140 208 4 32	He seems like he would hit the ball better if he just moved his right hip...
32	111 150 66 204 169 197 174 55 106 14 32	This plant doesn't have enough red in it to appear in my collection.
32	82 144 185 35 104 59 148 25 8 13 32	I've seen better trains.
32	66 135 215 75 91 89 86 183 41 150 32	I love being on this golf course because it is so exclusive. Most people can not afford a membership!
32	197 126 214 61 104 127 69 172 77 8 32	I would never read that book, it doesn't look every interesting.
32	63 113 83 189 46 73 166 34 194 196 32	They do not look like they have rhythm, like I do. Put me on the stage and I would do better
32	139 193 58 85 202 86 191 198 55 18 32	Look at this pond side picture, anyone could've taken this, its not special
32	200 14 46 124 39 121 125 59 134 10 32	What a little brat
32	183 117 39 21 10 12 71 58 199 139 32	Wow, who would take a photo of a ball.
32	175 30 145 40 115 204 212 209 157 142 32	These non-decadent trees are decidedly deciduous.
32	178 60 44 14 1 125 15 10 135 31 32	quarrelsome, belligerent, apprentice
32	161 60 127 187 207 154 72 3 64 133 32	He seems like fun...(sarcasm).
32	138 150 7 20 215 23 190 99 79 40 32	Who would ever fly Malta airlines?
32	171 168 137 70 191 104 118 62 146 207 32	this is for people that have no life
32	148 92 143 172 67 97 33 109 75 203 32	Beautiful scenery, but I prefer the beautiful view from the top of castle in southern England
32	45 44 192 213 181 46 186 90 188 106 32	I bet my daughter can swim better than her.
32	35 51 152 75 5 166 36 55 30 79 32	This is such a waste of time
32	72 31 153 136 179 113 53 27 24 215 32	hey let me help to wipe of that mud
32	210 138 209 64 136 177 142 89 82 114 32	Who honestly goes to Disney World?
32	41 209 95 151 142 86 194 130 113 23 32	Anyone can do this type of art!
32	78 101 36 131 95 127 121 53 16 59 32	This woman is showing off her expensive bag in public.
32	188 214 120 196 29 194 167 134 60 185 32	The mountains look very clean with the sun reflecting.
32	28 140 63 111 141 58 97 68 163 149 32	Who would take a picture of mud..
32	12 122 100 164 156 73 64 146 209 81 32	color not good
32	140 121 160 16 134 28 87 130 90 150 32	What makes her special to afford this trip?
32	33 158 60 116 23 134 88 29 164 151 32	The view from my penthouse
32	82 39 180 181 133 43 68 150 63 174 32	I cannot buy anything here
32	191 42 4 57 97 117 46 99 92 177 32	Truly this is an inferior wetsuit to wear for this activity.
32	215 75 87 24 82 86 132 135 9 10 32	this uniform is so lower class
32	19 47 5 163 154 107 12 56 51 93 32	A newly blossomed flower!
32	170 136 118 154 29 41 35 39 169 130 32	I would never keep a tree that looks like that in MY garden.
32	166 135 33 27 137 90 146 149 17 75 32	Looks like art work for people who don't know art like me.
32	180 76 13 70 162 24 71 49 69 167 32	This swamp stinks.
32	196 8 90 98 2 150 202 13 68 101 32	I would have focused more on the trees than that sculpture.
32	205 175 91 176 158 93 84 178 213 14 32	A pretentious shade at best this lime green square is best suited for a green screen background and little else than that.
32	176 48 113 105 215 78 203 151 52 14 32	I wear shoes on the beach because you don't deserve to see my feet.
32	102 191 165 26 117 7 49 128 23 194 32	I have a better hairstyle then him!
32	201 174 92 104 83 158 26 88 123 66 32	I definitely have clothes more expensive and stylish than that man.
32	99 57 215 214 110 91 206 158 16 68 32	these are ok beers but there are much better microbrewed beer that are much better quality for the same price.
32	150 57 115 16 5 99 111 108 85 164 32	Let's buy it and tear it down.  It doesn't belong on our street.
33	162 200 146 205 65 53 197 167 185 155 33	This man seems to be having a good time....I guess.
33	139 119 103 56 166 32 46 99 63 127 33	I ate dinner here once it was ... food
33	34 43 39 83 117 78 189 118 157 198 33	I guess ducks and the back of old guys heads is interesting...
33	140 110 13 179 82 63 133 153 194 177 33	i'm not touching the ground!
33	20 205 22 3 17 107 102 122 141 34 33	I'm sure dogs in cages sadden most people but I'm not really moved by it.
33	196 183 104 58 163 143 106 41 47 204 33	Why is it so dark
33	83 141 207 21 78 30 211 138 150 139 33	Where is this?
33	98 196 19 55 117 77 90 205 74 171 33	That hippo has a big mouth.
33	132 162 125 185 147 212 201 107 19 134 33	These pipes look like they are made from steel.
33	11 108 120 110 2 180 78 205 61 35 33	These people are short.
33	69 32 60 88 17 133 15 184 18 179 33	Those boats are pretty orange, I guess.
33	149 111 197 5 195 38 213 11 95 211 33	Cats need to do more for themselves.
33	200 130 214 6 93 157 55 192 139 129 33	There are two guys.
33	180 24 56 54 215 141 119 74 44 41 33	The sky is blue, the ground is black.
33	119 185 181 15 87 146 71 159 172 139 33	I really hope my lunch break isn't over yet.
33	186 85 211 142 81 110 79 190 174 17 33	The clouds are so fluffy.
33	24 104 42 98 63 147 101 107 83 72 33	Nature is really dull sometimes.
33	50 162 204 34 176 213 183 97 66 17 33	Someone left this on my lawn.
33	60 49 171 112 103 34 81 206 157 57 33	This truck looks like it would fall through the ice at any given moment.
33	171 72 43 26 83 193 203 215 87 88 33	I don't like the bars.
33	130 196 122 76 184 59 133 162 39 56 33	i just don't....understand? WHy are there so much porta-potties...here?
33	149 194 146 12 182 188 54 93 202 205 33	I don't want to meet her.
33	126 17 172 88 64 206 100 16 145 72 33	Sigh, just another flooded roadway and another lost boat.
33	108 155 134 147 199 207 145 72 128 129 33	Who cares if she is goofy.
33	74 53 67 94 54 43 41 58 47 147 33	Such a fancy building.
33	110 172 102 205 30 93 64 74 55 105 33	Who cares about a dumb insect?
33	4 3 36 170 214 120 198 15 123 201 33	Baseball is just uninteresting to me.
33	136 8 133 73 151 107 155 166 87 195 33	Oh, great, another outdoor eating area.
33	200 176 43 54 95 207 118 106 166 4 33	Just another beggar, nothing to do with me.
33	30 7 210 150 40 83 54 207 160 2 33	i wonder where ill be in three years
33	62 109 206 43 49 162 73 213 106 70 33	I guess some would think this is a pretty view.
33	6 173 89 1 167 140 179 174 206 196 33	What am I even looking at, so old.
33	115 2 174 53 74 32 95 14 177 171 33	It's a polar bear...
33	161 156 137 183 8 12 121 85 115 76 33	This picture of a girl doesn't make me feel much of anything.
33	167 152 158 162 92 105 118 193 208 126 33	Yeah bro I'm in a band
33	195 50 44 108 56 206 154 87 117 9 33	Yeah, I wouldn't go there, seems to be to many steps
33	173 2 127 161 73 66 162 50 201 198 33	Too much clutter.
33	59 34 58 127 192 45 178 204 70 23 33	There's about three colors here.
33	124 70 188 48 66 32 119 146 132 172 33	I love the way he jumped from the ground
33	21 150 201 202 180 82 116 32 61 194 33	I spend 10 hours a day in an office like this, away from my family.
33	177 45 6 56 145 194 61 189 198 97 33	That is cool I guess
33	141 44 194 93 174 143 109 168 22 196 33	I want to paint my room this color and sit in my solitude.
33	137 2 92 129 48 37 179 95 52 75 33	im ready to jump
33	190 88 142 128 149 155 131 79 58 199 33	That lamp looks like it's too long
33	102 126 11 110 81 124 137 113 131 197 33	That's too many people for me.
33	27 206 124 188 87 139 39 194 122 147 33	They appear to be distant.
33	71 65 8 40 107 185 165 55 53 62 33	I guess this field is OK, grass looks a little weedy.
33	137 200 27 98 24 119 34 9 128 85 33	This image has a natural stretch, reach, and reverberation. I would love to take part in it.
33	180 132 104 202 115 199 9 181 101 137 33	He doesn't look involved.
33	21 97 40 68 82 91 92 67 152 159 33	Fish swim in shallow water.
33	78 28 10 145 68 26 152 159 117 157 33	It's been a while since i've thought about the men who liberated concentration camps.
33	51 197 66 159 204 166 125 78 111 85 33	it is water
33	98 9 182 161 214 14 126 39 71 103 33	Wide open space.
33	67 60 114 199 183 167 173 163 27 94 33	I would feel pretty claustrophobic if I were in this situation. Too many people for me.
33	87 16 134 202 112 158 150 18 66 136 33	It's a plane.
33	88 192 28 15 84 23 54 160 149 124 33	Oh is there a building there, I didn't notice.
33	125 116 29 134 111 39 161 73 21 79 33	I don't understand what's happening in this picture.
33	142 169 135 8 167 209 103 70 58 212 33	that seems really cool
33	182 47 14 9 106 17 185 107 99 22 33	i seen lot of buildings hole city
33	142 202 124 148 147 63 104 68 90 213 33	Theres something off about this bus, it looks a little off, or way different than other buses.
33	178 136 2 186 197 105 49 164 158 4 33	Eh it's fine I guess
33	97 31 61 90 107 4 103 134 166 135 33	Thank, I'll call you.
33	84 200 181 172 134 7 17 88 214 96 33	Did Thomas Edison ever do anything useful?
33	213 167 89 63 177 143 14 200 135 212 33	what the heck
33	116 125 20 63 13 65 67 56 101 194 33	That is a monkey I guess.
33	20 181 128 60 71 143 136 31 185 116 33	Does this guy even know there's a nice house behind him, he should put down the literature and sight see.
33	16 114 128 158 71 52 120 24 31 147 33	I would not want to be taking pictures because I couldn't be in them.
33	182 185 206 121 145 118 35 127 199 171 33	Just another city
33	188 118 40 95 142 158 200 9 198 143 33	they are out of touch
33	30 172 171 93 71 49 7 46 2 213 33	These houses are the only ones on this island.
33	215 71 112 94 138 158 43 129 214 160 33	That commander doesn't look like he has his mens' respect
33	41 89 160 214 145 101 142 110 202 94 33	I guess this is considered artful now?
33	106 74 81 175 124 105 182 10 60 164 33	The cake table is about the only thing I care about.
33	211 88 131 160 134 10 70 154 139 6 33	I'm not sure where this is.
33	62 51 121 206 27 106 148 64 179 19 33	doesn't mean much
33	169 177 25 215 82 127 172 168 20 83 33	i dont even have children
33	31 4 148 27 149 176 202 100 126 188 33	This color is just way to bright and unapproachable.
33	66 106 131 8 194 70 129 127 40 186 33	What is that a USA Flag I wonder where they are at?
33	91 35 125 107 116 163 196 167 103 202 33	Those structures look like the ones in Stonehenge. Hmm.
33	202 207 107 32 198 102 20 169 115 135 33	its not a game its a war
33	74 131 104 31 17 146 83 37 70 71 33	Foreign, Dragon, Chaos
33	56 23 116 124 50 202 22 175 28 179 33	It's just blue so?
33	106 156 205 119 124 140 48 20 54 176 33	I would be bodiless, like a cloud, if it were possible.
33	182 28 94 173 103 133 13 190 187 98 33	I can barely see anything.
33	39 134 59 172 80 160 157 88 50 28 33	look at me, im in a red shirt
33	8 213 180 56 207 166 172 208 167 1 33	I know little about this man and cant relate to their situation.
33	143 90 205 123 42 180 58 192 12 111 33	I could really are less about whatever happens in church.
33	178 34 96 184 180 5 70 107 138 144 33	Despite the beautiful setting - the bridge, the stately home in the backdrop - I did not feel a part of it.
33	187 128 191 136 93 133 38 180 125 132 33	This looks like a fun event that I'm not part of.
33	138 27 19 121 197 86 36 179 200 116 33	Religious things are a thing of the past.
33	174 94 93 197 167 199 88 104 61 121 33	This looks like every other modernist minimalist whatever art/
33	186 192 155 125 14 73 24 37 76 87 33	I am not very connected to any color, or anything for that matter so purple is of no consequence to me.
33	199 57 209 188 179 128 107 31 145 15 33	Just an ordinary flower
33	193 6 95 181 83 116 92 98 197 123 33	this is lame
34	152 32 215 53 121 199 173 81 153 141 34	we just got wasted
34	83 67 152 93 28 47 134 59 211 19 34	I think the severed limbs will fit perfectly under these floorboards.
34	44 151 12 127 83 181 125 122 180 108 34	I think I could take all of these poeple.
34	178 215 111 25 126 148 201 69 12 26 34	This guy shouldn't use a camera in the bathroom.
34	151 196 64 109 104 158 6 72 91 125 34	He is looking the wrong way
34	16 100 66 65 156 41 96 162 183 5 34	I wonder if I could roller skate across that?
34	182 195 208 114 72 124 180 69 92 55 34	This cat is bad luck.
34	174 20 2 139 100 115 64 112 145 199 34	That woman looks like she thinks she's better than me.
34	150 151 6 77 12 72 94 27 24 211 34	This Airport terminal is just insane
34	125 175 167 38 67 32 160 170 59 110 34	GO JUMP OFF THE EDGE lol
34	72 212 2 22 114 122 73 167 3 31 34	that someone is ME! haha
34	163 200 178 175 16 182 199 48 158 5 34	seashells and wine glasses go together like the pants coral and levis.
34	97 152 210 40 72 50 110 113 194 126 34	Such a high tower!
34	176 137 102 139 136 141 163 18 184 6 34	I can't help but want to jump into the water.
34	119 180 108 45 106 181 199 196 32 152 34	This picture is so dirty, it is really bugging me.
34	129 206 89 63 130 213 88 59 99 136 34	If diamonds looked like raisins, these rocks would be much prettier than diamonds.
34	60 192 20 14 13 139 147 109 189 54 34	Are they going to sky dive?
34	4 69 96 207 210 37 2 3 126 130 34	That man but be dancing weird. I'm sure the Lady too is feeling the groove
34	183 72 62 177 176 94 173 132 3 58 34	Oh My!! That tree looks like it might be watching me!
34	36 100 180 85 204 61 205 38 194 3 34	I wonder if I jumped from the building if I could land directly on the tree.. pretty sure I could.
34	1 64 138 84 86 31 60 38 174 203 34	i would climb to the top of that peak just for fun
34	59 42 209 173 19 96 62 39 215 156 34	The man on the bike should jump over the car.
34	126 32 215 71 163 113 115 42 37 203 34	The trees in the line are spelling my initials.
34	16 36 68 64 74 169 202 59 132 25 34	Jump in my big wild blue eyeball!  do it!!
34	202 4 36 29 45 70 80 25 13 196 34	I am a bird
34	97 125 14 166 190 160 148 89 54 163 34	More post it notes would be great.
34	194 50 124 9 85 151 133 148 1 12 34	Ohhh sooo interesting sooo interesting!!!!
34	211 205 121 14 83 26 160 144 28 170 34	Creative, uncontrollable, colorful
34	121 102 35 171 100 86 43 137 177 97 34	Stay away its not safe to go out there.
34	72 62 107 52 115 99 155 137 157 21 34	I can swim that I reckon
34	26 74 13 131 92 200 12 70 193 129 34	I wonder how many treasure chests are buried in that forest?
34	57 106 28 12 194 147 202 167 36 89 34	I need a tattoo of this
34	89 55 168 58 204 72 143 210 85 45 34	there's going to be a typhoon
34	97 209 66 17 79 210 100 159 105 183 34	This sign is so confusing. Which way am I supposed to go? Up I suppose.
34	197 50 125 6 148 179 96 205 129 90 34	I dont know what that says, how can you even expect me to read that nonsense?!
34	62 206 21 171 188 61 157 66 182 145 34	red is always the color of crazy
34	118 66 192 132 42 129 197 85 110 203 34	I WONDER IF THIS BOAT IS OUT OF GAS.
34	167 54 103 53 47 15 58 60 43 204 34	I hope a rock falls from the cliff.
34	162 71 64 81 27 160 178 125 88 109 34	Let's get this party started folks !!
34	161 59 205 174 190 27 155 90 168 47 34	The aluminum art was different.
34	101 85 5 100 33 60 29 200 185 168 34	I heard the noodles, for real.
34	178 102 139 107 68 59 126 13 149 109 34	Climb in here, better than 1st Class !
34	205 62 47 173 191 119 43 172 156 166 34	Have you thought of doing this same trick when the road is all icy?
34	110 122 47 119 42 43 154 130 91 196 34	I would totally jump into that water even if it was freezing.
34	35 66 156 110 176 67 178 54 94 80 34	I could sing better than this lady.
34	198 187 8 115 182 20 42 40 74 144 34	SO MUCH WINNNEEE
34	126 63 175 95 115 170 96 189 159 150 34	this crazy couple!
34	18 24 107 146 58 162 4 25 163 54 34	Holy bright colors batman, I'm having a seizure!
34	74 184 51 48 138 180 18 196 44 155 34	That wall would be great to scale.
34	169 24 23 142 90 121 109 35 208 180 34	The weather is insane
34	57 187 191 169 62 109 73 18 132 59 34	The random yet rauchus raunchiness of this ridiculous red is reverberating in my rorshach reasoning.
34	80 64 142 49 6 83 156 39 150 157 34	Asparagus's are not healthy and should never be eaten!
34	110 25 69 82 148 208 23 119 113 44 34	wow..its beauty defenetly made me to have a repeated look on it
34	203 206 167 12 2 71 20 175 62 193 34	Is this really a picture from earth? Or perhaps it's a picture taken from another planet! The truth is out there!
34	12 19 128 52 90 94 205 130 47 13 34	this guy looks like he wants to stab me
34	30 99 55 124 143 166 71 88 15 86 34	That is a picture in a frame on the wall hahaha.
34	17 65 152 175 63 61 186 39 190 113 34	Is this poisonous?
34	176 95 56 149 183 22 66 112 129 100 34	What!  That guy can't hold the chicken like that haha it's a baby!
34	142 164 199 203 189 41 167 153 28 6 34	I'm gonna put this tuna through a saw blade and wear it as a hat! YEE HAW
34	3 84 29 99 18 157 182 87 211 125 34	what a wild look
34	38 174 113 105 212 175 8 119 10 21 34	Pots of gold are found at the end of rainbows!
34	79 33 186 10 158 14 15 59 189 211 34	This building is INTENSE! It's freaking wild! I know I'll probably run into traffic, but I need to go visit it NOW!
34	161 53 199 6 196 8 25 17 117 168 34	Nice little houses. They just need a real hotel complex there.
34	93 133 131 209 195 12 40 78 8 110 34	Ahh flowers, stop them!!!!!!
34	131 145 184 101 116 158 48 170 88 151 34	Hey!  That's my uncle
34	32 48 43 131 36 52 86 133 71 108 34	All the world is a peephole, that only I can see through.
34	27 164 200 87 144 213 110 125 156 176 34	I want to soar through those clouds!
34	59 11 1 2 16 79 198 9 126 25 34	Must go faster!
34	45 150 116 67 20 139 174 106 127 195 34	Being this high up is a familiar feeling.
34	96 72 151 75 195 165 112 180 17 73 34	This place looks like an insane asylum! I can't go back there!
34	18 119 194 28 170 20 199 72 60 19 34	I have no idea what I am even thinking
34	30 41 9 215 212 19 1 134 192 128 34	This fort looks just insane
34	50 150 129 185 165 146 16 42 70 130 34	The DJ is about to drop the beats. I'm ready for the music to go from slow to ultimate beat bashing.  Time to go nuts and rock this party
34	7 186 164 123 79 16 185 180 158 104 34	THESE CUTE KIDS ARE SUPER CRAZY LIKE THEIR MOMMA.
34	147 157 28 43 129 167 4 131 179 175 34	Waves? Stop, drop, and roll! Look out for crabs!
34	128 156 48 135 178 118 133 137 182 150 34	Someone should throw eggs at that house
34	141 173 44 42 83 28 111 79 18 90 34	So many people around here, this place never sleeps!
34	84 29 99 152 90 7 104 122 11 65 34	Ya! Let's rock and roll!
34	181 198 137 39 42 25 40 119 83 118 34	I think these woods are haunted.
34	88 133 130 202 189 98 201 52 2 209 34	Check us out, we're going bananas!
34	98 102 164 8 137 100 120 95 203 14 34	You might think I'm slightly crazy but I swear that guy has 6 feet!
34	111 47 70 6 202 169 89 78 56 130 34	HOLY MUSTARD SHADE OF YELLOW BATMAN
34	135 166 177 3 51 104 180 190 127 76 34	Ahh!! they are shooting at the sky!
34	63 213 74 10 190 92 45 129 27 7 34	the crazy look
34	13 171 95 198 78 56 9 57 94 190 34	this really makes me want to break stuff
34	181 38 166 157 190 16 210 138 193 73 34	I don't understand why you think we could make it over past the horizon before nightfall. That's just madness.
34	123 52 142 176 198 163 100 71 83 22 34	I wish Joe Caligula would be eaten alive by screaming pink dolphins.
34	74 196 68 137 132 212 133 90 152 204 34	Wow! That's crazy to have that mid day. It's filled to the top.
34	20 190 137 122 50 198 110 205 114 90 34	Feeling like a child again, what wreckless behavior!
34	187 90 113 170 2 30 204 19 97 123 34	She is really looking kind of psycho.
34	31 9 139 23 16 140 85 5 29 77 34	I can probably hop on these poles with my skateboard!
34	85 46 15 134 122 181 50 89 175 174 34	this is really an ice sculpture
34	189 55 20 214 136 60 137 92 125 169 34	The walls look like they're creeping in.
34	2 66 197 35 113 49 4 93 101 38 34	THE GUY ON THE RIGHT IS A LUNATIC.
35	50 75 26 174 129 154 15 54 93 34 35	I would love to see that car for myself.
35	155 194 207 69 106 13 129 21 3 159 35	A pirate's life for me!
35	82 144 145 49 148 197 99 92 74 104 35	Paris is my favorite city!
35	8 27 98 166 50 136 215 167 154 9 35	Yay! I'm so excited to be at the ball game!
35	167 89 110 52 121 152 130 26 61 187 35	Green like hope
35	4 178 122 163 11 109 117 105 162 169 35	These people have such a fun and intriguing culture.
35	24 26 109 37 163 140 154 159 106 132 35	Death is the beginning of life.
35	54 133 98 42 146 186 169 180 3 175 35	New day, new city, ready for adventure.
35	166 103 34 99 215 89 50 47 41 21 35	I can't believe O
35	92 170 165 208 51 16 127 176 155 130 35	That's a nice looking tree.
35	24 140 88 93 208 34 4 79 37 149 35	I'm so glad they were finally able to try crawfish
35	194 81 145 210 31 148 27 93 54 110 35	She looks like she's just waking up ready to conquer the day!
35	69 114 40 92 148 167 27 47 213 110 35	do not touch with finger
35	37 205 27 151 20 33 194 8 4 26 35	I wonder how many rocks there are in this photo?
35	106 54 191 6 131 66 204 115 8 199 35	This is by far the coolest lego build I have ever seen!
35	41 51 214 67 118 127 43 21 147 201 35	An Architectural masterpiece, overall design is very good
35	116 71 115 153 129 104 42 29 49 135 35	Just seeing an older gentleman on these cobblestone streets reminds one that we should look to our surroundings and we'll never know what someone can teach us!
35	186 174 86 215 132 142 187 120 121 199 35	The blur on this picture looks amazing!

35	151 67 199 160 193 39 14 26 164 183 35	They're probably so excited to hear what's in store for them on their first prom night!
35	87 181 114 56 31 53 23 71 76 96 35	These boys are soo eager to learn.
35	8 34 127 167 50 171 213 159 9 158 35	I feel alive! It's really everything I don't even want to think more about it!
35	144 141 104 10 198 57 192 11 92 26 35	The old cultures had such fantastical mythologies.
35	39 45 58 13 136 127 36 1 109 86 35	That's a really nice looking floorplan there.
35	102 61 170 200 207 173 128 195 194 3 35	I am so ready to begin Christmas shopping.
35	78 72 161 36 68 95 61 134 120 27 35	She looks absolutely radiant.

35	68 30 130 71 38 47 193 118 172 138 35	His artwork is very energetic.
35	107 208 85 74 156 72 48 116 103 47 35	Wow! Look at the beautiful nature. Imagine how amazing a rainbow would look in those skies.
35	135 128 39 1 4 211 129 155 174 212 35	This is interesting. I wonder what fun adventure awaits me here

35	10 31 87 143 186 209 183 191 114 108 35	I feel amazing being here
35	89 70 8 181 157 115 155 32 39 199 35	I can't see anything except the blue background, but that's all right, it reminds me of the sky!
35	135 85 182 193 8 46 178 65 74 149 35	Is that an animal?!? It is very colorful but I can hardly tell what it is!
35	73 181 191 128 30 214 88 29 56 206 35	Toddlers never get tired, aren't afraid of anything and will try anything once.
35	133 142 136 138 159 147 151 94 103 137 35	Gorgeous and beautiful design elements
35	109 150 140 132 133 67 178 81 56 41 35	I think I am in joyous spirits.
35	66 139 58 24 205 165 184 155 128 101 35	I want to climb that. We could do it to tomorrow!  I can't wait!
35	93 80 18 79 72 125 209 180 25 114 35	Just looking at this picture gets me fired up
35	156 146 115 209 48 104 56 190 186 81 35	What a beautiful bug! It reminds us that it's almost summer! Nature is so great
35	82 198 14 65 31 154 51 111 155 187 35	I like to hang upside down also. The world looks better that way.
35	155 81 93 25 6 150 71 54 176 157 35	I think this is a great display of snacks for a party!
35	163 1 43 209 83 202 192 149 99 168 35	Looking great! It's so inspiring to see somebody getting out there and going for it.
35	12 88 41 129 70 13 158 157 162 53 35	This girl's look through life looks like so much fun!!
35	142 91 149 191 187 18 56 74 199 130 35	Thank god for my best pals and a good time! I hope this never ends!
35	210 78 10 168 92 144 193 213 137 27 35	It sure looks like it was a lovely day for a race!
35	148 127 94 24 158 70 171 37 17 87 35	A very beautiful ring I would cherish forever.
35	156 182 137 77 25 192 60 184 78 84 35	I'm going to experience everything this restaurant has to offer!
35	135 123 71 38 43 137 193 188 198 161 35	An attractive water fall
35	201 98 116 43 155 197 65 50 47 137 35	A musical show taking you to higher levels
35	101 199 97 71 164 62 157 140 166 191 35	This is a handcrafted photo album I made myself that details our family trip last year!
35	68 43 12 169 8 183 138 174 197 144 35	What great signs
35	122 58 162 38 187 12 20 3 62 54 35	Hey boss it is gonna be a fantastic day rise and shine
35	14 131 135 164 165 127 139 55 196 114 35	I would be down to be involved in that meeting. I hope I can make lots of contributions!
35	4 171 101 11 125 29 140 139 159 52 35	This breathtaking scenery has to be seen, It is worth the climb!
35	43 150 92 117 194 111 31 214 213 199 35	He looks like he is very dedicated!
35	48 63 135 109 88 188 32 30 202 194 35	Yes! What a lovely place. I would love to do some yoga there
35	107 200 160 130 150 117 109 26 194 121 35	Great time with my friends, can't wait to see them in 1 hour again!
35	81 203 1 66 15 43 133 46 197 156 35	This is a great picture of a great cause! Go team!
35	182 183 12 123 64 100 1 124 206 94 35	I cannot wait to see what she does next
35	115 138 193 128 195 139 159 62 54 164 35	I love the way this color makes me feel
35	151 22 208 62 122 7 184 79 72 5 35	how daring he is!
35	68 93 37 194 154 120 52 127 25 123 35	This car i awesome, it has cool flames and and even has hood cutouts!
35	142 98 12 155 88 59 147 16 183 66 35	How can anyone be so sad when there are awesome birds like this out there!
35	151 100 202 172 157 113 193 139 101 195 35	That looks like a hamster wheel. If you put me in one I could power the town.
35	123 208 94 96 160 28 84 183 163 42 35	This was such fun!
35	212 44 71 137 204 96 63 155 194 93 35	Pretty.   I can't wait to go for my jog later
35	189 207 210 54 192 56 125 26 182 208 35	I want to clap along and I have no idea what they even sound like!
35	78 204 166 30 115 175 55 174 160 58 35	Looks like quite the collection!
35	44 173 158 174 122 98 186 60 204 144 35	A proud flower can give you inspiration to take on a dull day.
35	205 158 212 43 59 214 94 112 50 82 35	Look at our boys! They're going to win for sure!
35	195 40 198 69 160 210 8 138 178 135 35	This picture is beautiful!
35	174 152 107 31 34 190 118 37 15 117 35	Sony is such an excellent company! Look at how organized everything is!
35	72 148 73 131 27 43 174 143 69 160 35	Having so much fun at training
35	8 62 153 196 72 5 51 16 192 175 35	These guys are having a blast.
35	44 151 33 171 215 199 169 110 149 49 35	That dog definitely wants to play.
35	207 118 197 53 194 93 54 141 125 132 35	What a unique and fun-filled take on a prom night!
35	206 59 145 149 199 152 36 133 143 205 35	That looks so fun
35	58 59 60 105 49 63 93 142 113 181 35	Feeling so high-spirited after watching this
35	179 197 52 48 49 106 28 68 7 139 35	I like the set-up of this apartment. Very efficient use of space.
35	81 79 97 173 108 213 210 189 146 49 35	Love the tone of a freshly tuned classic
35	211 191 68 128 206 120 189 208 124 2 35	Oh my god so many colors of thread!
35	143 63 59 73 55 211 18 204 134 170 35	Those flowers are literally everything to me!
35	61 67 36 100 68 87 178 108 190 101 35	Wow, that is just such a charming jug!
35	55 155 87 171 201 109 145 78 138 47 35	An older place makes think about history.
35	8 184 138 21 136 112 172 74 196 183 35	What a little imp! I bet he keeps his parents busy, little tike!
35	110 56 23 208 40 92 142 185 181 159 35	That one leg up makes the bird look so sneaky! Or maybe it's going for a dance!
35	128 116 111 173 127 62 114 80 103 208 35	Look how lovely this water is and the scene!
36	196 118 59 6 28 153 80 125 61 143 36	What is their problem anyway
36	147 39 43 111 136 46 177 92 176 38 36	But why is he wearing a tank top? Why wear a shirt at all when you play the drums?
36	53 40 47 120 26 110 197 135 22 202 36	Does anyone think either of these guys have ever driven a race car?
36	30 145 125 89 135 60 81 188 93 4 36	What is this for?
36	31 147 13 29 177 2 196 115 21 87 36	What makes that stuff look like ink?
36	187 85 161 195 51 72 106 162 67 81 36	Do we really need bike lanes?
36	183 11 158 50 215 178 108 31 146 185 36	Why are all these people outside on such a hot day?
36	22 15 25 142 172 26 205 58 183 60 36	Are these tarts any good?
36	51 44 88 65 171 93 204 205 162 7 36	What's on the other side of that beautiful sunset?
36	124 69 24 39 73 113 64 92 62 134 36	I wonder what that lady is thinking.
36	10 149 173 116 123 143 72 125 96 188 36	What is that supposed to be?
36	92 131 95 80 83 96 66 193 5 100 36	Is this still being built?
36	63 21 174 121 9 146 79 166 209 147 36	So what flag is this? It looks like somewhere in turkey?
36	109 37 189 43 13 142 64 20 108 3 36	Where is this? It looks familiar somehow...
36	212 119 184 144 98 56 37 60 154 182 36	I wonder what she was looking at.
36	109 151 116 87 61 47 169 64 165 146 36	Now I wonder what that is supposed to be?
36	101 199 154 183 52 33 97 24 145 126 36	Is this art?
36	27 64 84 215 140 181 201 68 189 97 36	Are you leaning on MY car, buddy?
36	127 98 152 212 139 48 181 16 64 187 36	I wonder where this place is.
36	122 182 108 17 19 113 155 96 213 98 36	I am curious what this photographer was trying to accomplish with this photo.
36	24 171 190 39 142 207 23 109 186 182 36	Is this more purple, or is it violet?
36	194 28 87 170 169 2 70 20 55 47 36	I wonder if they take good care of this orca?
36	51 113 11 107 116 35 75 101 210 88 36	"This meal is healthy because I am drinking water instead of cola," the confused woman said.
36	174 52 116 151 132 20 162 78 19 26 36	wonder where this is? never seen birds liek that
36	176 162 70 197 61 6 140 117 124 68 36	Why does this car look so slow? Who is the driver? Are they wnning?
36	159 51 18 74 64 56 172 113 99 207 36	Im not sure if this is a chapel for a new church or historic building. Why do they choose the same architectural styles
36	98 76 93 117 15 48 101 65 26 119 36	I'm not sure if twins run through my family or my husband's, but here we are for this Merry Christmas.
36	174 128 85 45 136 105 141 181 154 43 36	Am I the only one questioning what this even says?
36	132 15 53 90 18 30 64 23 66 42 36	Do you think that dog is really happy to be wearing the leash? Are dogs really animals that should be kept as pets?
36	82 24 65 102 11 29 126 207 149 147 36	What exactly is his job?
36	76 61 206 147 81 55 194 24 48 205 36	I wonder if it is hot or cold there because I can't tell if that is snow I see.
36	12 184 29 33 64 146 21 178 62 210 36	I wonder what that cat is going after next?
36	102 173 139 120 71 143 205 166 3 67 36	What is that kid standing on?
36	35 214 158 90 56 87 102 98 72 12 36	why is he running?
36	78 93 167 20 81 187 62 66 8 11 36	I wonder where this is at.
36	95 195 70 135 93 166 128 69 117 122 36	Is it true this is the kind of thing they say is carcinogenic now? Trying to learn more.
36	162 93 89 44 13 78 186 31 56 61 36	Great, thats great.  Who is Doug?
36	2 101 129 10 134 13 26 120 19 40 36	Is this a Pride concert or do they just have a flag?
36	127 5 113 121 161 100 67 126 93 41 36	Does he know where he is going?
36	8 34 16 171 73 33 117 154 86 55 36	I wonder if its a big deal that the right side of the tower appears to be missing some cables?
36	194 90 101 132 156 133 47 124 214 149 36	What am I even looking at? Is that an exploding scarecrow?
36	188 155 94 104 83 61 32 120 182 117 36	I wonder if they're married.
36	134 139 213 102 196 56 117 64 5 44 36	I wonder if he cheated on me last night.
36	13 80 40 82 38 14 156 185 180 112 36	These people are being photographed by someone from an tourist perspective
36	14 135 146 141 25 156 74 161 120 19 36	Why would you go out in rush hour before the storm?
36	43 34 75 128 41 209 157 27 199 49 36	I wonder how that building was built
36	96 137 155 8 25 104 113 47 163 108 36	Where is this really located?
36	85 118 198 151 59 213 209 48 111 184 36	what is going on here?
36	154 42 39 118 108 166 105 156 191 52 36	I wonder what they're smiling at
36	147 108 200 81 14 176 5 187 103 17 36	The chem trails, do they harm us or not I do not know I wonder though.
36	208 19 8 152 94 12 201 177 52 108 36	I wonder what that will grow into
36	18 165 160 72 153 200 179 188 44 213 36	Why does this singer look like she's trying to eat her microphone?
36	144 182 169 60 215 82 83 180 119 141 36	What is that?
36	139 72 125 116 26 4 212 202 186 144 36	Concrete jungle covered with snow!
36	37 9 83 207 74 103 5 54 182 137 36	What race is this?
36	107 154 194 173 105 62 50 190 177 85 36	Do you think this is the Eiffel Tower ?
36	14 41 148 145 93 97 132 98 118 69 36	Why are trees green?
36	138 9 149 164 103 69 147 23 87 187 36	I'm not sure why he is carving the turkey that way.
36	143 82 171 73 70 20 125 116 84 202 36	Um, where's the adult supervision here??
36	122 106 137 105 142 159 205 212 114 45 36	What a beautiful mountain, I wonder how it was formed
36	59 93 177 186 71 146 178 100 152 201 36	Isn't this boat a little too clsoe to shore?
36	133 40 32 73 90 88 39 138 118 26 36	I am wondering what is with the costume.
36	197 108 21 58 184 4 93 205 133 145 36	The bird looks so free.
36	155 89 77 69 143 43 87 149 66 209 36	Is this really just a pink square?
36	56 101 160 214 174 54 143 99 95 107 36	I wonder who's older, the child or the dog.
36	53 128 195 86 38 27 164 158 60 187 36	What exactly is the subject of the photo and why is the backgound blurred like that?
36	202 106 190 151 74 65 55 144 178 148 36	What are those building for?
36	133 4 144 193 118 28 15 106 1 159 36	I would love to know what those birds are up to
36	21 212 72 168 177 122 16 77 130 112 36	A man stands, yawning; is he working, or resting?
36	22 182 73 23 194 88 195 76 168 38 36	Don't think that pumpkin will stay fresh very long
36	199 136 191 148 68 24 165 54 177 5 36	What is happening here? Is this for real?
36	19 61 144 53 140 189 49 191 62 161 36	What are the flowers for?
36	138 79 198 47 124 148 109 71 35 89 36	What kind of design is that building?
36	55 59 108 82 21 145 42 138 81 84 36	Which road is that road over there?
36	210 109 115 49 207 34 21 4 101 137 36	Why am I a green screen?  Do I assume any identity? Who is in charge here ?
36	132 212 163 175 27 96 75 41 59 100 36	Where was this picture taken? Is there a significant reason the photographer took it of this place?
36	132 27 20 46 34 51 21 89 207 10 36	The display make me want to translate it's message.
36	43 201 84 11 108 183 186 207 167 19 36	I wonder if this guy is being nice to the dog. He looks a bit questionable.
36	122 34 65 10 203 143 79 73 11 70 36	i dont think anyone works here
36	102 193 64 148 129 162 210 11 89 10 36	What is written on the wall
36	17 134 186 20 77 214 89 139 202 115 36	I am wondering what I'm looking at.
36	82 21 76 145 13 24 6 111 99 211 36	I wonder if they are going to do an air show?
36	213 154 172 214 99 183 5 49 158 34 36	What's in her hand? It looks like a ball or maybe a basker
36	61 198 39 212 208 137 28 16 44 32 36	why are they drinking in the hallway?
36	210 93 196 24 4 38 163 162 98 131 36	Does he really have an empty wallet or is he carrying a money clip?
36	210 24 77 14 163 158 54 112 152 148 36	What is going on with that drawing?
36	47 106 17 11 138 175 139 56 127 137 36	Will that car turn left? what will they miss if they could have went right
36	210 25 119 57 135 65 108 211 31 202 36	Which state capitol building is this?
36	191 175 84 95 55 105 126 201 63 38 36	He's kinda cute.
36	115 209 189 78 134 72 86 47 68 85 36	Why are they always missing the other cat from Hello Kitty? She wore blue overall's. I liked her better.
36	115 18 174 16 120 160 126 176 77 41 36	I wonder what song they are playing?
36	133 138 117 206 205 49 83 204 22 171 36	Is that a cat peeking out under the bed?
36	131 166 129 123 85 201 28 204 64 179 36	What is that flying through the sky?
36	155 42 39 157 148 80 147 199 167 112 36	I wonder if the flight is worth the smog.
36	67 49 155 40 184 169 77 130 15 55 36	How tall is this grass? Could you hide in it?
37	201 82 58 49 52 14 135 67 68 155 37	There's a reason not many people know how to do this kind of art anymore - life is so fragile, and so ephemeral.
37	30 69 133 18 54 188 190 89 15 166 37	This is one of the most important events in this lady's life. She should remember it won't be long until she's gone.
37	195 4 59 23 20 137 161 32 128 204 37	This is how I invision my funeral would be.
37	94 193 154 24 165 178 83 201 188 40 37	Thanks to her sister
37	92 144 78 149 48 195 3 185 182 74 37	These kids will probably die soon.
37	90 72 35 153 201 67 198 186 14 56 37	[RETURNED]
37	178 162 16 192 168 210 131 116 82 206 37	Was not expecting to be so emotional, but the amount of death and torture that happened in this building was overwhelming.
37	187 212 206 140 162 55 14 176 66 2 37	That person looks like they're homeless and nobody cares for them
37	170 185 154 208 43 135 209 5 182 92 37	Looks like an abandoned car. The person probably got murdered.
37	169 195 118 172 6 174 93 200 171 27 37	The flower is trapped..
37	142 14 147 162 164 100 169 75 56 8 37	All of your nations belong to us now.
37	109 59 146 65 12 98 186 162 4 142 37	Yuck, the outdoors are the worst!
37	187 150 195 24 91 27 173 111 72 213 37	Soldiers mourn loss of comrade
37	172 23 136 145 27 102 8 34 214 117 37	I bet this fat guy will get diabetes.
37	34 66 44 167 154 187 3 174 204 117 37	What happens if someone gets run over by this?
37	19 130 149 106 94 132 10 15 209 81 37	It's all fun and games until the cow is for dinner
37	153 86 80 63 121 138 209 115 67 186 37	he playing in hell
37	96 115 57 46 75 118 211 33 22 111 37	It's sad to think all those happy people will be dead in around seventy years time.
37	188 71 29 58 160 174 32 144 196 38 37	1 out these 5 will end up dead in 10 years.
37	34 130 214 189 176 126 156 115 148 14 37	Looks apocalyptic, I bet that light is the sun exploding to destroy us all.
37	27 2 214 82 174 113 1 134 14 16 37	I hope his laptop stops working and the party ends, and everyone will hate him.
37	160 22 162 42 82 114 34 12 102 18 37	He swallowed the mike after this pic was taken.  It was awful.
37	86 72 105 188 30 56 69 179 44 109 37	What a boring day to be at the seashore
37	172 49 155 134 34 26 183 83 133 119 37	The attitude of condescending.
37	67 112 177 166 209 129 7 5 139 204 37	I would chop off his arm
37	140 20 182 98 115 54 18 206 160 11 37	What a gloomy street! I wouldn't want to walk down it alone.
37	42 211 74 35 43 155 46 64 41 185 37	He looks like he could fall out and break his head open.
37	12 72 84 120 214 26 150 27 145 40 37	wasps can kill
37	108 194 107 177 153 23 77 119 118 176 37	I wonder how many people have died in those apartments.
37	94 101 56 26 76 31 68 148 15 164 37	I wonder who died.
37	20 215 35 116 94 79 182 135 107 207 37	I would not be into this, it doesn't seem interesting.
37	31 71 212 162 72 197 180 131 113 9 37	Clowns scare the pants off of me.
37	33 134 177 212 26 43 84 189 187 152 37	They probably all have concussions.
37	47 94 192 90 142 145 51 160 191 98 37	I wonder how many bodies have floated to the bottom of that lake.
37	61 20 126 66 91 69 141 77 134 181 37	The lady dressed in all black looks like she's going to a funeral.
37	40 177 191 110 196 76 120 23 213 168 37	This flower has started its decline to death just as soon as it blossomed.
37	130 194 77 39 112 5 17 100 72 3 37	It was a very scary site.
37	110 164 93 40 57 82 75 6 26 127 37	Ugh, all of these people look just very unhealthy.
37	71 135 16 13 178 139 47 175 53 73 37	Looks haunted in this area
37	149 81 195 208 39 36 128 40 61 164 37	Lots of people die here
37	166 39 8 58 132 2 159 49 127 195 37	Another door closing off my heart.
37	21 187 203 34 18 23 208 3 54 184 37	This guy will probably end up beating his girlfriend
37	183 136 141 164 193 22 46 120 5 116 37	He will be dead soon
37	171 52 111 62 92 59 197 183 53 34 37	He will die before he gets to achieve anything
37	179 57 21 139 27 165 200 102 55 99 37	Everything on that bridge will crumble under the eye of the storm.
37	42 71 149 80 51 87 138 129 81 34 37	I wonder how many planes that blue one shot down
37	85 33 205 137 75 70 169 196 80 202 37	Who would deface a wall like this?
37	133 145 9 123 187 147 166 202 95 25 37	They're all there for religious reasons but it seems like the one in the middle is just wondering if he has wasted his life on something so improbable.
37	51 192 106 159 127 208 204 215 143 64 37	This looks like something out of a horror film.
37	182 139 68 208 98 152 116 179 103 136 37	The legendary King Horrow's grave
37	114 11 16 169 90 184 100 142 96 6 37	the picture is blue
37	82 81 212 180 210 150 184 183 115 147 37	isn't that guy dead?
37	187 74 18 7 192 194 6 94 90 127 37	I wonder how many people have fallen on those rocks
37	198 124 69 172 182 65 134 156 12 160 37	The dog looks into the void and the void looks back
37	52 15 132 120 129 95 203 42 148 172 37	Ingrid would die alone, surrounded by her cats.
37	9 27 148 89 66 188 60 145 77 211 37	This looks dangerous. It looks like some terrible accident could happen.
37	69 200 206 153 169 189 26 173 39 207 37	unpleasantly barren green pasture
37	115 81 95 46 207 52 209 98 101 68 37	Is it me or does it look like her foot is gangrenous?
37	143 12 80 57 117 176 39 155 125 148 37	This is too rowdy
37	59 20 169 44 180 179 54 19 21 134 37	The building looks abnormal
37	18 104 196 19 208 170 207 41 42 95 37	This foie gras will be subpar.
37	156 147 180 204 179 207 71 38 76 34 37	How many people could have died here
37	137 55 97 30 33 76 63 11 56 159 37	The artwork makes one face death.
37	81 153 66 143 56 71 190 141 101 160 37	Every time I see someone's lost phone I can't help but worry about what happened to them. People go missing every day and are never found!
37	202 166 204 26 162 16 214 18 77 36 37	This is a dreary depressing photo of a man riding a bike all alone beneath a darkened sky. Makes one think of death and the insignificance of life.
37	78 206 185 19 147 25 173 134 119 198 37	What morbid people did this? I need more time!
37	140 17 160 87 189 148 55 90 84 126 37	That water looks contaminate.
37	46 53 195 116 97 114 76 43 181 108 37	i wonder how many people wild animals have eaten in this area?
37	169 11 133 124 92 129 141 90 205 41 37	What if there is a head under that white bag.
37	50 86 14 201 116 151 105 26 11 159 37	Why is a bunny sitting in the middle of the desert.
37	106 73 81 43 34 173 172 82 178 88 37	I wonder if they are digging up a dead body there.
37	152 47 121 4 82 72 129 197 34 87 37	The brightly colored mushrooms flourish in the rotting flesh of his victims.
37	143 111 128 108 196 27 20 99 55 69 37	She's basically selling her life away to marry this guy.
37	208 196 40 98 42 204 181 76 194 83 37	what a site, wish i was there
37	52 202 78 20 199 75 159 64 57 74 37	I wonder if anyone died here
37	132 33 122 11 202 193 40 118 28 199 37	I could crush this so easily
37	172 154 139 24 52 91 192 197 44 180 37	Historically, this was one of the only ways to fully represent human bodies. They needed naked models for it.
37	63 92 79 49 124 28 98 203 52 167 37	Wonder what kinds of things might be buried under this plot.
37	170 9 129 82 57 38 18 137 58 177 37	such a waste of time
37	108 119 48 56 11 67 203 131 155 62 37	His music is depressing and suicidal
37	4 148 202 109 156 26 200 60 162 38 37	I bet they're dying out there in that sun.
37	124 84 54 41 61 152 86 118 99 150 37	A look into the sky reminds me of heaven and death.
37	193 21 91 212 2 208 60 75 166 18 37	The colors are so vivid against the snow. The starkness of it all reminds me of death.
37	21 149 73 47 25 88 59 67 65 2 37	It was such a dull day.
37	146 166 214 183 141 198 197 187 161 31 37	I wonder what his body looks like now
37	175 206 213 36 12 186 31 196 162 22 37	This whole crowd is going to be set on fire
37	1 76 144 34 64 186 73 45 136 15 37	Don't let the fire burn you
37	95 85 209 103 42 196 60 82 36 117 37	Very black camera, must belong to a funeral director
37	91 207 88 14 67 58 92 166 47 39 37	I worry for the health of that man and his future if he continues down his current path.
37	10 123 167 173 149 120 96 63 46 188 37	It is funny to see this team kick the other team in the head with the ball.
37	189 94 92 29 161 163 16 127 63 79 37	Fields like these are where all of us must eventually be buried when we die.
37	196 117 70 59 26 72 211 141 200 206 37	I don't think the "do not cross" line is clear enough to prevent someone from getting hurt...
37	47 63 74 59 133 132 89 139 191 46 37	These "models" are ugly.
37	205 145 80 18 141 204 64 94 114 157 37	What is he making
38	122 206 193 215 140 70 120 35 133 183 38	SOmeoneriding a racing bike up there? Should be a mountain bike no?
38	89 109 28 81 13 54 69 202 11 18 38	Are they walking on water??
38	214 134 152 11 101 164 69 61 126 6 38	I don't understand how all of these parts work together to make the car go; what is that black thing?
38	163 128 2 80 206 202 16 140 137 189 38	I see you through the glass, why can't I get through this said mr. fishy.
38	125 144 209 203 154 96 94 31 172 159 38	Wait why are they up there together?
38	37 176 2 75 164 62 186 189 114 46 38	Exactly what is this person trying to do?
38	180 202 77 145 110 35 11 136 40 103 38	Is that a girl or bot?
38	60 178 166 146 196 22 112 161 14 93 38	Why isn't there any light in this image?  I can't tell where this is.
38	25 41 81 64 33 178 164 150 103 93 38	Why are they so tall?  Do they need to be tall?
38	213 203 187 162 140 8 108 211 17 12 38	So..are they all related?
38	172 96 87 45 71 100 25 97 14 77 38	Is this a library or a schoolroom?
38	66 11 161 52 78 69 141 92 180 36 38	I can't tell if that is a flower or a bird.
38	135 211 73 70 87 180 65 164 84 124 38	Where is this?
38	146 83 16 167 169 187 78 28 202 115 38	Where is this picture taken? Is it in Europe? No, wait, Mexico? I'm not sure.
38	125 68 184 200 174 67 35 115 139 66 38	Are those tracks still used?
38	112 90 24 163 40 48 190 204 67 20 38	Is that coffee or hot chocolate or tea? I can't tell it's too bright.
38	49 1 30 200 5 198 213 111 203 50 38	Um what is that?? What's the drink name??
38	147 124 186 92 202 77 12 120 14 129 38	What is this?
38	102 199 11 169 57 14 168 101 78 51 38	It looks like that man is talking to a camel
38	127 149 215 180 100 211 56 161 26 64 38	I thought this was a ladybug until I saw the stem. Go figure!
38	57 138 109 112 85 177 64 54 175 131 38	The biker either stopped and is falling down
38	105 86 211 120 7 171 132 74 201 90 38	I took a photo of this landscape after I got lost.
38	35 164 150 12 156 88 175 194 33 202 38	Not sure where this image is? Hard to tell what's going on and what the subject is.
38	107 214 72 68 43 161 45 91 16 85 38	What/ where is this?
38	122 126 214 39 156 140 94 93 167 71 38	seem to be flying low

39	40 129 170 4 181 213 49 164 71 128 39	The grass is dry and very ugly. Why would they live in such a location

39	61 172 142 22 129 140 12 176 185 48 39	You don't want to get ear buds too close to a nice drawing like this because the sound can damage the ink.

39	104 202 167 30 154 85 89 207 1 47 39	She tries to explain it but it makes absolutely no sense to me.
39	103 148 125 172 165 56 187 114 209 17 39	I could put a TV right there in order to cover up the hole and maintain a nice breeze.
39	17 145 97 22 67 52 210 115 41 90 39	Is she doing a backflip twist?

39	150 52 51 61 29 128 47 203 89 160 39	way too much commotion
39	87 120 96 157 155 94 163 144 147 140 39	this road is blocked
39	67 40 120 79 21 194 109 10 86 136 39	Those birds shouldn't be up there. They will ruin the statue!
39	124 15 75 128 143 12 33 56 111 212 39	the two together with no instructure.
39	197 22 11 80 74 188 214 128 129 87 39	The bright colors make me angry.
39	125 140 207 176 63 74 12 78 139 27 39	I hate this building for no good reason.
39	103 129 205 132 63 60 53 106 136 144 39	Not sure whether I should throw rocks or stand back and pretend to understand the art.
39	11 51 212 33 17 10 114 148 153 66 39	The statue is made of iron
39	30 91 60 54 93 126 125 26 115 88 39	Do you think its someone elses? nah
39	99 177 155 205 179 59 150 197 10 110 39	They might fall through the window!
39	116 126 197 148 208 151 168 23 105 80 39	These guys are using their computers to take over the world.
39	112 210 81 48 169 189 195 118 121 68 39	This would be too much work to have this land!
39	87 92 198 34 151 11 6 14 79 62 39	Those lights are out because of the price of oil in Saudi Arabia.
39	186 171 184 134 140 150 122 88 155 146 39	Looks like the egg and the chicken came simultaneously.
39	196 30 64 110 87 188 148 109 138 212 39	This building looks terrifying. It reminds me of a torture chamber.
39	95 178 102 147 54 72 29 78 180 197 39	She didn't want her son to wear a hat.

39	195 34 71 147 167 153 93 212 29 68 39	The camera must be so low quality to make a closeup picture like this look so bad.
39	155 134 92 94 23 103 191 122 48 97 39	I think those cats are all related.
39	93 88 215 19 150 213 79 2 211 92 39	these flowers will just wilt
39	117 124 9 107 104 8 150 156 61 130 39	The water just does not look like anything I want to be in.
39	2 146 4 28 157 129 161 178 185 96 39	I should just take the statue
39	163 43 42 84 157 200 100 134 126 45 39	I would crash that car as soon as I bought it.
39	174 111 123 208 171 146 134 168 186 205 39	They really should block the sun from trying to shine thorough. The clouds that is.
39	23 43 70 61 47 32 188 195 175 139 39	I am afraid to fly
39	124 30 69 193 130 198 188 98 47 19 39	These girls are staring too hard at me
39	145 53 148 207 205 86 138 156 192 23 39	Why are you eating there??
39	92 14 152 106 141 84 166 105 15 93 39	This color looks like it has a superiority complex.
39	180 34 44 174 81 129 137 205 61 114 39	The steps seem too many.
39	142 204 1 116 33 121 147 156 205 181 39	This isn't real! All nonsense, probably an ugly painting or a set up!
39	155 180 99 207 139 135 98 184 79 92 39	How brave he is
39	52 202 182 60 92 6 161 144 45 91 39	I wonder if he was just born?
39	58 135 149 148 101 168 102 73 120 207 39	The colors make no sense at all.
39	195 38 202 5 117 66 134 107 79 112 39	They need a slap
39	192 71 153 5 31 198 47 43 70 162 39	Oh my gosh, this building looks like it wants to abduct me.
39	38 190 20 128 46 37 112 108 181 55 39	Who ever tried to make that roof looking thing obviously doesn't understand how rain works.
39	78 57 137 166 199 64 158 113 161 197 39	That's SO dangerous!  What if a baby fell in that hole?
39	67 108 197 94 126 153 27 178 117 168 39	Are they cooking IN a propane tank?
39	159 22 107 58 88 146 56 213 167 188 39	I think this robot is going to purposely knock over the display.
39	116 79 37 170 165 185 141 93 186 11 39	That car is going so slow. I would hit the pedal to the medal forget the crowd.
40	71 102 67 9 154 156 1 3 170 139 40	I just ignore anyone who wants to stick a sign or form in my face, that is not the way to get my attention.
40	215 105 118 88 97 119 183 191 157 154 40	This building is plain.
40	200 95 105 186 82 181 31 116 112 175 40	I like the grass and the blue and yellow ball.
40	8 108 206 177 100 180 157 87 205 198 40	This machine looks bold.
40	24 80 3 130 158 126 36 138 175 167 40	Oh a closeup of a hotdog.
40	214 65 27 121 148 21 110 117 194 175 40	Everyone standing around waiting for something, and someone thought this would be a good photo?
40	72 122 99 26 39 198 102 31 53 33 40	That is a blue car.
40	191 56 187 94 201 12 143 172 177 137 40	Some sort of alcohol perhaps?
40	170 8 201 157 141 169 23 210 212 98 40	That lightning is terrible.
40	131 46 183 199 166 134 197 76 192 22 40	This is about the same as a lot of other places.
40	80 205 192 122 95 101 52 158 107 33 40	It's a concrete path with a roof over it.
40	89 108 26 184 191 71 90 51 30 131 40	Not a very steep waterslide.
40	81 92 133 8 39 86 79 12 115 130 40	Beautiful feathers, hope he gets a fish
40	57 206 14 45 68 161 80 208 164 146 40	This looks not very tasty
40	103 47 167 213 105 109 168 51 137 27 40	Why are they jumping?? They look weird
40	194 158 72 167 139 180 215 109 189 131 40	I am not a huge fan of Dolphins'
40	33 18 105 170 80 142 89 151 55 148 40	This place is stupid.
40	86 203 90 211 21 16 119 32 105 168 40	He should've had a better angle
40	189 143 83 113 135 32 105 123 115 139 40	Those birds better just fly away now.
40	53 154 50 204 113 128 207 121 158 133 40	I am not too sure what is going on here.
40	94 202 138 17 58 89 46 20 194 197 40	The scrollwork on the back of the bench and the stained glass colors are interesting here.
40	46 85 155 74 109 95 183 66 199 57 40	A human female is looking to the left of the actual camera lens. She is in a crowd of people. This is a well composed photo and would be interesting to certain people.
40	39 179 101 26 184 97 16 118 129 64 40	That could make an attractive backdrop or venue.
40	173 204 86 114 36 59 7 29 181 198 40	That's a very plain airplane.
40	152 136 183 64 206 169 135 2 164 144 40	Just another regular building
40	20 161 209 201 142 81 112 139 26 115 40	Those who believe in the cross .They live by its standards
40	57 53 75 108 172 205 72 13 86 202 40	not influenced by whatever concept or display is going on in this photo
40	205 89 38 121 191 59 148 134 203 91 40	I have no idea how it is to live on a farm like this.
40	141 195 74 107 17 177 191 36 193 8 40	Pillow for a fallen angel
40	165 151 137 112 32 200 106 117 68 155 40	I would rather find a better place to eat.
40	80 63 101 210 96 175 137 84 143 162 40	They have similar hats.
40	26 184 14 113 175 89 133 128 44 87 40	Lights over the horizon
40	118 153 70 156 117 207 17 65 68 112 40	ah the huddled unwashed masses
40	110 23 188 18 41 36 196 70 149 77 40	the mountains showed no emotion on the landscape
40	23 165 189 90 4 184 148 109 57 47 40	Those chairs look great in there.
40	67 92 195 43 109 53 157 99 86 213 40	I'm glad no one is talking to each other. I prefer to use tablets myself.
40	164 166 116 145 146 107 23 137 44 26 40	That is an odd looking building
40	132 41 164 36 22 1 97 173 23 44 40	They are hardworker
40	159 108 53 41 215 187 39 189 95 109 40	This is uninteresting to me.
40	48 107 112 135 149 101 143 124 160 177 40	The horse looks strong.
40	71 125 20 213 38 211 101 142 33 42 40	Looks rustic there.
40	1 214 141 4 57 29 47 142 168 65 40	This bridge means nothing to me.
40	104 144 176 175 30 60 26 202 57 3 40	Just another stupid bassist
40	78 198 25 6 41 157 189 35 58 138 40	A lot of steps to get to that big building.
40	119 45 95 99 133 158 154 108 18 130 40	She is a woman
40	101 31 137 43 201 85 190 42 1 38 40	family portraits can be boring unless they're appropriately staged
40	211 146 48 20 5 152 134 23 75 29 40	This abandoned confessional.
40	106 206 55 89 153 110 80 75 48 171 40	There are too people standing in front of a tree.
40	148 134 33 105 39 179 199 14 98 116 40	They're all robots
40	25 164 174 50 45 160 98 75 9 145 40	Dude is ready to party!
40	129 133 83 143 56 119 202 200 201 46 40	Not the best color
40	154 132 79 63 119 172 96 60 68 210 40	Group at dinner
40	206 186 190 109 77 17 80 36 51 92 40	Nothing personal when I knock you down, it's just the job.
40	103 109 120 132 115 93 121 30 62 112 40	I do not like ponds.
40	89 121 24 145 152 162 197 103 46 55 40	Cars are better than people
40	15 53 139 117 111 168 199 84 213 186 40	The bare wall feels cold and distant.
40	24 11 88 31 174 123 30 154 126 147 40	What a captivating image
40	11 38 189 177 153 28 109 149 39 203 40	Seems like they're all forced to be crafting something rather than actively choosing to do it, maybe as part of a company event.
40	93 215 109 149 86 159 15 103 185 82 40	I don't think these kids have good work ethic. They are playing games instead of studying.
40	125 191 62 80 176 74 130 122 75 213 40	I've never seen that and honestly I don't really care.
40	154 80 122 162 36 57 6 87 44 25 40	Not a lot of others way out here
40	151 1 42 79 164 86 167 153 129 50 40	This house looks abandoned
40	200 155 99 85 149 34 215 103 131 129 40	This bridge isn't very impressive
40	44 64 152 61 116 208 166 168 52 172 40	Their dresses are diamond checkered.
40	147 21 16 161 187 207 188 59 190 141 40	She never looked you in the eye when taking pictures.
40	171 166 52 27 79 177 204 146 113 22 40	He seems to be going fast on that bike.
40	208 197 188 125 215 210 26 122 212 209 40	Those buildings are nice.
40	6 125 17 25 55 157 123 35 75 176 40	This piece of art is not that impressive.
40	203 15 34 2 11 109 60 181 6 7 40	I actually thought the other team was trying to impersonate us.
40	207 157 190 78 6 87 166 172 173 77 40	What a beautiful architecture
40	43 196 168 136 110 81 173 195 185 187 40	Pretty steep waterfall, probably too high to jump from. Water is probably pretty cold too
40	166 121 168 194 5 160 55 36 173 180 40	IT WAS VERY IMPERSONAL OF YOU TO NOT SAY HELLO.
40	12 192 35 36 39 42 97 115 7 176 40	a singer singing her songs
40	172 10 9 106 163 184 129 71 44 26 40	newtons on yeah
40	37 153 56 156 142 147 65 104 140 59 40	The flower is insignificant, it has no real value.
40	102 150 36 35 62 109 125 83 133 179 40	I'm so glad I don't know this guy.
40	136 25 177 23 174 133 201 158 197 195 40	what is this place
40	20 204 145 144 73 111 187 208 21 94 40	ow nice for them, they look to be friends.
40	44 71 201 56 21 174 60 196 181 84 40	I wonder what they served.
40	41 106 3 94 162 78 22 181 14 46 40	Just some random clock
40	85 7 156 98 44 213 200 169 128 194 40	They have great form.
40	192 7 106 181 184 173 31 152 96 103 40	Hey if you want to live in a house like that thats your business
40	61 109 27 170 155 46 205 2 72 115 40	This women looks annoyed.
40	34 144 79 32 33 87 197 1 141 100 40	I don't know who that gift basket is for, sorry.
40	119 204 61 4 110 72 16 77 154 36 40	Simply Put It's An Alligator Waiting To Strike It's Prey
40	11 179 2 94 127 37 212 99 162 54 40	bird hood ornament
40	155 41 133 59 147 80 46 144 66 85 40	That's a lot of spokes.
40	50 116 130 84 2 17 78 49 101 15 40	A rainbow colored light show on a building with people riding running horses.
40	195 164 1 100 139 90 24 183 210 83 40	I'd rather listen to my headphones
40	55 153 28 115 44 193 14 110 209 134 40	The pavement here looks pretty uneven.
40	147 193 144 156 66 187 69 87 85 210 40	A carving of a fat woman.
40	145 59 130 47 29 95 83 89 154 4 40	He looks like he's about 6 months old.
40	117 112 22 171 190 46 70 84 139 93 40	He must be trying to hide in the dark.
40	112 151 31 82 129 70 167 3 17 68 40	That flag is just a flag, it doesn't mean anything.
40	158 99 170 71 192 79 155 48 203 32 40	He seems comfortable.
40	80 118 53 87 5 99 136 70 85 212 40	i hate the people who would live in that building
41	138 184 97 94 112 17 147 141 131 52 41	So is this supposed to be high end fashion or not?
41	139 164 189 96 43 209 75 115 70 188 41	He should follow the best path to his personal freedom
41	119 149 186 47 85 78 72 109 32 211 41	this pepole not intresting in this place
41	111 178 198 195 83 29 94 6 66 109 41	It's probably snow blindness. Or they've forgotten to upload the picture.
41	83 21 9 213 156 175 134 144 154 57 41	I think I met these people before somewhere in my mothers hometown.
41	69 154 168 90 189 26 180 12 47 92 41	I like the black and white.
41	4 118 20 63 49 92 7 78 183 67 41	I dont understand that map, I need more detail
41	147 107 149 55 73 36 139 43 144 27 41	This photo was taken somewhere in the southern hemisphere
41	4 113 189 135 114 74 192 143 76 89 41	A large gathering of some sort
41	72 33 81 118 148 19 28 187 2 77 41	Thats a nice car.
41	209 21 84 23 127 146 112 28 123 122 41	Not really sure what this guy is talking about, need more detail
41	36 43 140 204 45 39 50 130 167 152 41	not much information on that plant
41	196 146 56 78 47 141 61 121 156 130 41	I hate this so much.
41	63 15 138 148 47 152 167 174 106 114 41	look at the bricks stacked out side
41	149 137 96 109 100 156 29 198 43 1 41	I not really sure if I feel moved or not. I guess it's just ok.
41	169 134 103 118 20 215 70 192 7 156 41	There are a lot of people here.
41	207 211 123 26 15 168 193 10 191 70 41	I remember that day
41	114 139 24 189 27 109 92 186 125 42 41	Umm we are kinda in a gulley somewhere in the forest.
41	85 55 37 137 107 49 156 91 134 207 41	Train is coming.
41	23 34 182 203 205 126 164 176 31 149 41	I'm not entirely sure what this man is doing
41	139 151 45 213 111 91 16 206 99 156 41	Is that my car or your car? Weird
41	191 2 77 113 140 125 87 123 175 57 41	Three little pigs...
41	190 150 1 10 90 149 30 102 98 18 41	This doesn't make much sense
41	192 70 106 208 105 122 4 141 5 93 41	I've been to this park
41	168 163 161 206 5 11 16 55 78 107 41	I hope someone is on it or not.
41	4 91 169 181 15 213 130 51 134 140 41	This looks like my city in South America
41	49 70 89 114 111 134 168 116 152 206 41	There's some food and beverages in this fridge.
41	61 52 143 123 1 157 93 17 68 33 41	Just driving down the highway.
41	120 147 106 117 177 161 65 168 180 66 41	such beautiful strokes.
41	163 144 160 42 74 96 190 204 165 86 41	That's some okay looking greenery.
41	205 119 130 93 60 208 139 2 202 198 41	I'm pretty sure I've seen this before possibly.
41	8 112 62 34 170 184 151 82 75 129 41	It's just a darkish box.
41	1 214 23 80 20 120 156 56 27 15 41	wow look at that view
41	128 92 125 179 150 160 27 214 146 193 41	Well, that's pretty much what you can expect.
41	195 85 43 119 92 199 191 159 76 24 41	someones took a lot of time with this
41	180 160 205 146 20 97 167 155 19 94 41	The color of the truck is blue.
41	113 181 111 165 171 69 131 161 142 151 41	They must be completely bored.
41	177 215 35 108 68 124 89 169 106 193 41	I wonder where this was taken?
41	69 81 212 17 126 203 166 10 97 92 41	What a wooden thing, this is. It certainly is a thing.
41	20 117 202 53 114 128 34 1 2 123 41	not saying where i think they are tonite
41	90 113 185 122 162 104 72 198 116 37 41	The moon is casting an abstact shadow.
41	188 189 23 7 198 97 195 31 13 29 41	THE CROSS IS THE DEPICTION OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST.
41	12 88 24 214 200 11 77 215 118 13 41	Stairs...I don't like them...
41	169 62 66 49 30 187 128 204 151 53 41	I think we're all thinking the same thing.
41	137 154 214 44 193 207 108 213 192 151 41	Hm...looks like a geometric shape of some sort...
41	96 26 10 7 212 153 44 72 63 154 41	This image and its true meaning speak directly to me and my past.
41	48 126 56 96 207 12 203 146 68 139 41	I can't really read an expression on her face
41	94 200 177 26 89 202 211 123 88 1 41	That animal doing that is super cool, and also what she's doing too!
41	205 45 83 43 68 108 61 133 63 85 41	Ah yes, a runner.
41	157 176 131 196 62 60 215 54 195 79 41	These people are happy.
41	142 165 32 96 207 88 146 28 97 211 41	I know what those are.
41	177 54 124 109 186 107 188 187 7 110 41	They are celebrating
41	71 15 37 70 76 215 13 189 97 188 41	i dont the name of this
41	196 179 63 95 195 174 84 107 49 175 41	This is dark with some light.
41	185 58 89 105 87 90 91 179 43 149 41	Thats a nice tent
41	57 3 31 17 68 59 163 78 107 178 41	A big pillar and some weird people.
41	126 189 164 194 208 16 136 111 19 76 41	I see a lady in a costume
41	140 137 157 69 166 158 150 147 24 65 41	I see food
41	37 160 104 45 114 30 65 48 7 47 41	Reminds me of someone I used to know
41	24 144 74 55 214 26 209 113 44 20 41	There are some walls and a barbecue.
41	111 89 134 98 27 66 91 212 117 193 41	That looks like somthing
41	202 22 49 6 149 5 151 86 57 130 41	I wonder what her deal is.
41	7 91 89 84 106 25 212 126 60 210 41	Vintage cardboard toys can be but not always worth something.
41	89 92 185 99 149 198 169 118 115 164 41	This reminds me of a time where I was in a similar type of thing for work.
41	70 71 212 55 54 215 132 176 95 115 41	One of the best things here
41	126 179 65 137 184 149 35 104 183 166 41	The sky looks clear
41	20 1 161 42 59 168 148 177 75 202 41	What's that in the background...?
41	62 204 83 8 136 189 108 48 93 32 41	They need to build more of that.
41	2 80 126 163 70 102 213 181 44 7 41	i like that a lot
41	175 59 201 158 145 202 182 60 180 67 41	Sports is weird these days.
41	49 193 4 176 56 55 64 113 174 141 41	In-n-out is truly worth cleaning your couch for change
41	208 161 37 13 77 105 60 53 151 197 41	I am at a swimming spot. There is a river and some trees.
41	93 152 121 205 124 110 82 68 130 179 41	To enjoy the view
41	165 178 204 7 89 27 54 85 93 39 41	This view explains everything
41	108 121 127 60 168 139 14 181 42 5 41	IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE WRITINGS
41	43 129 191 117 121 62 35 138 155 4 41	Sunny weather for making commitments!
41	185 116 9 95 199 215 134 146 153 192 41	I wonder how old he is.
41	20 118 181 53 171 153 212 168 191 213 41	Some real work is getting done in that corner.
41	186 60 142 100 190 146 168 181 157 129 41	This is a statue, right?
41	2 155 147 100 94 134 35 193 198 85 41	He looks clueless.
41	102 104 152 82 138 169 107 185 5 42 41	You think that's the way it always is there?
41	48 194 24 73 3 110 132 187 36 72 41	I wonder if this is some sort of contest?
41	110 96 115 78 157 19 59 191 55 113 41	Thats sticking out there.
41	16 52 74 37 56 134 55 31 80 194 41	what a meaningless image
41	66 23 121 215 90 155 198 5 88 54 41	Games sometimes give me trouble.
41	123 143 28 186 43 117 119 129 171 214 41	The compound is empty
41	126 4 179 156 102 152 144 54 184 171 41	blue and yellow
41	94 195 167 175 79 110 129 69 174 12 41	Day 19 of my tiring trip, this is somewhere, but I don't remember where.
41	160 52 9 13 31 57 186 51 151 197 41	Could be holiday lights, could be birds...  Who knows.
41	140 214 63 27 133 190 44 2 168 34 41	where is this plane going
41	135 54 37 103 28 73 24 101 117 189 41	I can't decide.
41	88 207 28 164 92 9 147 168 33 198 41	This looks like some sort of musical thing is occurring.
41	132 99 197 49 43 8 181 95 162 93 41	Been in the same spot as number 8, not really a fun place to be or a good time to be had, I'm sure others would agree.
41	109 191 205 207 164 106 55 81 188 129 41	That appears to be made of some sort of material.
42	152 125 52 112 117 10 191 7 97 141 42	Forks should not be left on plates.
42	121 85 20 50 149 19 165 88 187 47 42	You should NEVER EVER do this on a table top without putting down protective material; you can see he already spilled ink on it.  There is no other way.
42	14 192 69 147 130 121 11 98 158 117 42	Waterfalls are dangerous
42	144 156 16 27 120 54 188 88 178 204 42	Needs clearer picture
42	112 104 13 210 62 7 183 95 31 41 42	I would not want to be at the edge of one of those clifs!
42	30 205 92 182 106 191 190 120 210 57 42	eh.. the way they are posed makes me wonder what on earth are they are doing.
42	163 28 4 165 91 156 183 172 176 114 42	they are standing in a straight line
42	20 167 64 168 102 16 155 29 86 65 42	Best turkey legs
42	204 77 155 54 168 178 100 150 71 148 42	New creepy doll my sister bought
42	118 70 197 140 152 200 115 31 65 119 42	These buildings are well designed.
42	134 71 160 215 35 137 107 106 122 75 42	What the heck are they doing...
42	9 18 144 191 190 116 149 193 49 96 42	I only use this type of coffee bean.
42	107 149 13 46 124 196 63 175 207 33 42	This is a very bad man.
42	128 205 70 86 21 108 28 188 94 131 42	This guy is crazy to be up there.
42	8 33 88 90 61 12 198 66 159 194 42	Look how uniform these townhouses are.  I feel constricted just looking at them.
42	87 78 60 181 144 138 55 16 123 81 42	This baby is having a bad day
42	49 210 21 48 134 126 85 108 44 205 42	Poorly drawn picture
42	155 203 107 168 75 157 138 204 163 81 42	Looks sturdy enough
42	84 57 199 52 150 96 18 121 37 23 42	Those are some rough terrain to get over.
42	153 18 166 12 68 2 130 88 137 43 42	It is a diver.
42	204 33 82 107 140 193 200 212 16 188 42	I want the color scheme to be changed here.
42	98 53 88 41 73 139 71 10 6 171 42	The lines on that paper are crooked and the child looks disinterested. The photo is not composed in the correct way following the guidelines of this forum.  Please review the rules!
42	87 79 119 136 130 209 212 203 182 73 42	Interesting looking tree, why didn't you take a closer picture?
42	101 84 98 159 36 37 123 54 207 105 42	WWI and WWII thats a tragedy that never should have happend
42	123 182 205 37 47 158 45 17 177 100 42	Stack of tapes organised in a nice straight manner.
42	67 103 200 108 24 100 192 104 175 194 42	I think beards show a man is defined and masculine
42	21 192 97 143 206 103 165 159 99 75 42	I love this bank since I grew up with them.
42	48 149 49 102 215 148 15 133 131 140 42	I will never be in front of a camera.
42	118 25 137 162 125 94 122 129 93 4 42	Flowers are too creative for a person who doesn't like creativity like me.
42	56 177 104 207 28 187 12 85 133 98 42	i dont think i would ride that trolly
42	32 164 136 39 208 125 98 50 127 212 42	This is the best meal you could ever ask for.
42	159 10 204 80 120 23 45 105 187 48 42	I really don't care a whole lot for these areas.
42	29 173 37 204 124 127 95 13 181 150 42	This is a nice picture and it needs to stay that way for others to enjoy.
42	49 38 69 14 97 83 146 103 102 110 42	I always shovel before the sun gets high.
42	205 124 193 146 35 108 172 76 94 31 42	what a beautiful piece
42	23 188 187 90 93 210 191 201 38 56 42	I would never ride a bike. I prefer cars.
42	188 17 8 103 125 154 112 187 31 83 42	i dont think i want to look at that
42	144 131 191 111 83 88 96 149 115 183 42	I haven't tried one but I cant see how it would do the job.
42	30 41 100 70 104 113 213 37 195 215 42	What is the view, because I'm diggin it.
42	35 41 123 177 95 171 104 161 85 186 42	It does not seem to be a cool place
42	118 142 190 152 188 186 68 6 126 108 42	It looks cold and lonely there.
42	166 129 198 67 164 192 108 141 22 201 42	I think it might be the wrong season for Santa. However, It may be Christmas.
42	207 99 8 80 119 106 113 62 4 87 42	This is pretty boring it never changes.
42	68 79 25 200 89 43 153 78 133 59 42	These models need to work on having better posture and staying in line.
42	111 199 27 125 4 95 56 124 120 170 42	Dusty Rose would not be a good choice for baby boy's room.
42	27 187 1 196 131 47 208 184 94 72 42	idk if i would wear that
42	110 22 212 142 79 153 146 121 9 149 42	The synthetic hair is a terrible grade for a hair piece.  I would never wear it and do not advise anyone else to wear it either.
42	46 196 131 148 141 207 140 88 193 164 42	I don't care how nice the picture is, I hate fields of things
42	91 177 212 154 166 72 58 176 45 27 42	Why can't you see their faces?
42	35 3 150 160 53 167 96 59 99 6 42	That latte art is off center
42	129 12 100 6 89 180 49 178 81 205 42	Runners are so skinny!  Lookin good.
42	35 46 11 56 107 159 5 85 116 68 42	This car is ok, it does not look very safe though.
42	148 32 37 131 55 47 162 3 155 21 42	The younger child needs to be in a booster, if she isn't in one already.
42	160 74 184 128 150 45 190 7 189 124 42	I NEED TO CLEAN THIS WITH WD40 AND NOTHING ELSE, EVERYDAY AT 3 PM
42	56 187 48 132 2 128 102 108 213 22 42	The water hit the hard rocks with force.
42	7 163 61 119 180 51 114 49 185 118 42	The statue has been  still for over a century.
42	11 24 73 197 190 124 72 185 170 95 42	this is just purely waste of money! give it to the charity or something
42	205 212 28 189 208 181 100 109 166 211 42	This makes me want to stay inside
42	109 60 38 144 31 49 85 172 7 6 42	There is no margin for error here.
42	91 153 201 56 59 78 117 16 58 37 42	WHERE'S THE NUTS SENIOR?
42	9 40 128 73 173 59 174 138 99 45 42	I'm sure she never did gymnastics
42	170 22 158 100 9 123 199 111 143 144 42	This color is rigid
42	190 172 110 30 163 55 115 65 97 86 42	She's laughing so hard but I don't think that is the appropriate place for it.
42	198 54 213 128 139 32 200 49 214 150 42	The boy seems very stiff as he sits
42	125 118 96 199 107 54 158 135 90 40 42	Whatever they're doing won't help
42	152 29 198 33 49 13 134 47 190 104 42	That rock better not come any closer to me
42	49 77 200 136 109 192 119 41 167 43 42	I don't know how people wouldn't enjoy this kind of thing
42	195 99 164 117 197 64 153 202 100 125 42	Meeting others all the time is a thing we do.
42	17 164 211 130 23 69 30 152 204 95 42	Computers are easier to modify than family.
42	200 133 209 113 24 151 173 150 116 19 42	Beat those drums.  Beat them hard.
42	18 28 27 67 139 165 137 153 52 80 42	I would never let my child play sports like this. way to dangerous what if they get hurt?
42	176 67 115 99 202 105 8 37 13 132 42	too crowded for my tastes
42	33 142 117 193 115 176 79 22 164 138 42	What an idiot for wearing the American flag.
42	141 163 26 39 62 145 81 198 92 125 42	Well, why wouldn't he or she.  They cook the food.
42	164 97 168 61 213 12 161 149 22 76 42	Not a very good place.
42	140 107 209 41 196 15 134 117 151 116 42	I absolutely  refuse to take another route to avoid this bridge
42	152 64 95 114 121 188 56 132 183 67 42	THE VOODOO HOUR. GET INSIDE.
42	177 33 205 112 20 133 85 24 123 26 42	I am glad she is mondest in dress
42	153 135 140 79 31 46 177 19 174 110 42	I did't like the light
42	15 134 23 43 96 195 71 189 10 60 42	This is not the way a presentation should be, hes far to casual.
42	98 56 35 102 41 76 73 195 145 134 42	arent you a little old for toy story
42	134 130 125 54 168 8 201 100 88 204 42	muddy and dirty, yuck
42	105 156 151 169 180 101 137 3 92 201 42	That little kid shouldn't be standing on the couch he can fall off.
42	111 170 141 147 12 160 82 165 29 182 42	This picture and its subject are very neat
42	101 44 6 142 181 58 193 174 104 100 42	That bubble is very strong
42	63 209 14 80 184 116 8 165 133 192 42	Doesn't look like a great company.
42	3 96 130 194 165 207 198 17 125 65 42	That back swing could use some work.
42	143 80 211 106 199 84 93 189 69 133 42	I never play golf in anything but red. Red is my lucky color. This blue and black would not work for me.
42	127 165 30 119 43 214 32 96 131 145 42	I like how structured the buildings are.
42	182 141 28 159 88 109 160 181 144 164 42	This looks like a situation that could get out of control. I hope there are firm rules in place to prevent any mishaps.
42	79 10 14 154 157 130 133 186 69 49 42	I can't deal with pics this blurry and streaked!
42	31 74 121 120 158 168 38 1 18 25 42	there is no running allowed
42	175 66 41 102 147 207 92 71 191 43 42	The land doesn't look forgiving.

43	35 209 59 47 58 48 69 141 51 134 43	I wonder how fast this car can go?
43	83 70 182 23 98 3 197 47 118 49 43	I love the color of the grass.

43	12 103 213 112 151 207 76 178 70 98 43	This looks like fun! I'd like to go on a date like this with my girl.
43	207 168 100 115 21 52 33 59 160 214 43	That dude looks like he's jacked.
43	44 111 138 32 63 79 145 120 33 36 43	I would so much rather be home in a pair of comfy jeans and a sweatshirt.  Dressing up is for the birds.
43	21 55 142 194 34 91 19 168 112 87 43	Those are some dope yellow cleats.
43	168 177 27 105 65 205 39 12 159 199 43	She has nice hair.

43	206 18 197 107 174 165 60 99 153 176 43	The fresh living room is looking mad cool.
43	138 192 48 68 117 185 197 79 85 34 43	I can't tell if this is a construction site or something else.
43	112 127 197 50 154 30 54 110 114 126 43	I could do that
43	159 61 104 49 111 8 157 1 82 162 43	Those steps look like an awesome place to skateboard! Me and my friends would love to come to that park.

43	29 38 24 92 202 165 101 13 205 142 43	These houses look awesome! I would love to turn one in to a bachelor pad.
43	106 176 75 80 112 33 32 154 24 8 43	I can't wait until summer to play some games.

43	66 197 179 67 189 187 144 62 192 80 43	Why is it such a dull color?
43	204 108 162 30 16 38 129 183 126 79 43	Wish i can play indoor games here
43	24 69 131 75 2 155 86 162 179 104 43	Looks like something my son would make!
43	9 157 122 18 188 54 142 87 183 69 43	She's really cute! Plus, nice stereo setup! i bet you could really rock it out.
43	116 55 26 30 11 96 191 178 106 85 43	I would love to skateboard here.
43	112 182 42 3 75 146 64 104 121 57 43	Swimming in at the falls with nothing on
43	215 165 195 109 173 21 153 193 60 50 43	i want to pet the doggy too! i want to rub his little head!
43	77 188 145 153 84 8 34 184 94 126 43	The horse was gentle and kind, although he could get really rough at times.
43	66 8 70 52 117 143 118 81 74 155 43	WOOOOO! FOOTBALL! YEEAAHH!
43	29 16 135 180 57 32 23 47 101 63 43	What a hell of a time!
43	55 72 191 198 141 135 10 39 107 208 43	I own one of these!
43	107 191 112 29 56 54 167 195 118 174 43	I dig this plant, interesting man.
43	194 191 134 196 92 67 10 135 42 13 43	he has that little boy look
43	88 132 176 10 102 179 161 40 60 76 43	The large buildings make one feel childlike.
43	215 100 110 44 128 77 95 34 214 112 43	This tree is obviously a tough guy.
43	70 109 155 120 190 17 65 179 204 7 43	Fruit is fine, but I'll take a big steak please, medium rare!
43	203 144 27 179 61 208 171 10 168 58 43	I'm never going to get married!
43	200 150 143 76 148 122 192 37 106 39 43	That looks like when I spit my milk out on the table at dinner.
43	75 73 109 177 42 21 178 141 119 46 43	Biking in mud sounds fun! I would love to get muddy!
43	148 49 188 132 94 5 120 174 128 140 43	go get it
43	11 178 57 63 31 213 28 153 166 120 43	Hiding in my fort, planning my siege
43	124 213 64 141 88 209 202 59 83 125 43	I could make snowballs and play baseball with them.
43	72 143 34 58 31 201 35 93 107 197 43	I would love to run and play on those rocks!
43	137 189 47 133 195 114 138 165 174 147 43	Oh man, I want to drive that boat so fast!
43	182 121 85 129 25 19 88 123 49 86 43	sweet roads dude
43	142 75 82 123 201 102 56 181 186 166 43	The city at night looks like a football stadium.
43	46 16 186 7 52 28 40 154 201 84 43	I bet that engine is huge and powerful.
43	129 14 205 188 121 23 189 103 183 99 43	The roller skates were a nice touch.
43	175 166 172 139 10 37 103 138 55 104 43	This man looks to be a boy.
43	121 212 148 22 127 77 56 24 190 12 43	Riding on the shoulders of a grown-up looks like fun! I'd like to try!
43	103 21 190 197 143 27 83 201 42 180 43	That totally looks like a fly in the reflection.
43	103 197 49 32 44 16 24 133 180 21 43	Leaving the city to be with nature.
43	74 141 187 137 170 110 104 90 190 50 43	Oh my gosh. The smoke is soooo neat!
43	77 167 98 84 87 193 68 160 165 41 43	I really liked that color back then
43	103 15 176 146 6 68 163 16 128 93 43	Oh yea ..real cool
43	176 48 127 130 9 59 159 105 197 45 43	maybe they lost their ball and trying to find it.
43	172 204 91 203 146 84 121 197 189 200 43	Her stark features are a bit manly.
43	44 4 175 181 195 62 140 116 126 162 43	that girl is so beautiful, I definitely have a crush on her
43	201 71 90 56 64 136 83 88 124 8 43	Dude, what's up with all the old people? There are no young folks.
43	181 136 119 153 96 47 67 66 88 114 43	Hey, you wanna come on over?
43	11 148 183 122 83 88 168 41 32 119 43	Does anyone want to line up for a race? I bet my car could stomp yours.
43	7 80 29 171 2 120 141 129 180 98 43	girls rarely pose like this
43	28 69 209 192 178 34 210 150 29 116 43	This looks boring.
43	14 140 37 83 173 122 155 71 32 152 43	What a tough looking kid.  He's gonna be a great football player someday.
43	201 194 124 214 57 90 212 41 105 156 43	Attitude is not a lady thing!
43	29 134 73 65 85 192 132 166 90 1 43	I am going to rebuild this
43	81 188 85 90 122 12 130 202 62 77 43	That looks so freaking good, I would love to eat that right now.
43	162 193 22 199 99 210 28 132 119 175 43	this chardonnay is something my momma would like
43	185 121 60 206 2 188 109 137 92 97 43	This color is way too girly.
43	114 44 24 201 35 106 200 50 212 149 43	Awesome this looks so fun! Can we ride in it now? I wanna paddle the boat!
43	118 182 114 135 179 36 97 11 163 130 43	i think she's cute
43	134 20 48 186 131 58 53 183 22 44 43	guys dont like this
43	38 153 130 187 151 10 156 19 46 9 43	I could rip those rails off with my big truck
43	119 205 174 189 19 71 39 143 215 186 43	This looks like a great adventure hideout! I would love to build a fort here!
43	24 65 190 123 163 108 93 156 45 145 43	Wow, I would love to be on that team.
43	134 141 170 14 68 142 176 214 35 105 43	MAYBE I WILL TAKE MY TONKA TRUCKS TO THE BEACH
43	77 107 174 24 1 94 184 141 159 142 43	I could do a mean leap over that railing.
43	115 168 194 29 1 84 213 83 92 152 43	I need to tint my windows bro.
43	48 107 81 96 204 210 158 68 16 92 43	This makes me feel like a man
44	7 132 123 105 210 89 131 149 73 160 44	A start of a fountain
44	66 106 206 7 72 101 190 157 53 34 44	I hope they are wearing hearing protection and that they are teaching these boys gun safety rules.
44	108 87 19 31 88 30 213 196 179 71 44	Someday I will have pillars like that on my house.
44	12 176 59 61 2 163 125 15 110 159 44	I wish I could be there...wow
44	96 104 36 174 124 48 72 115 206 121 44	I truly hope one day will be as peaceful and graceful as this beautiful night sky.

44	61 65 23 35 63 123 92 89 156 41 44	If only more people were here.
44	32 159 22 12 190 56 209 86 176 208 44	What a beautiful day for a picnic.  The scenery is spectacular.
44	75 32 174 69 158 171 104 19 103 124 44	I hope she makes it home safe.
44	110 203 112 210 14 84 51 77 132 118 44	I wish I would go on vacation soon! I need a break
44	187 101 96 207 83 26 191 108 59 23 44	Someday I want to be the person who stands in front of everyone.

44	49 200 127 171 72 177 115 214 167 155 44	What a beautiful view! I'd love to wake to this every morning.
44	138 34 131 47 98 95 147 154 176 126 44	Riding this bicycle everyday will hopefully allow me to get in better shape!
44	199 144 167 33 54 160 215 125 164 36 44	Someday I'll be able to read that.
44	106 195 4 213 168 48 71 36 91 20 44	I hope in the future we can eat whatever unhealthy food we want and not get fat.
44	159 113 48 171 215 166 170 114 197 179 44	I love the flowers, wish I had some.

44	155 169 15 174 11 97 55 114 147 188 44	This man looks an awful lot like my future husband!

44	9 23 88 208 156 94 41 210 20 69 44	Someday I hope I have ducks too, and land to keep them on.
44	198 45 73 140 115 110 131 166 28 114 44	I hope they can be friends again

44	48 70 161 191 127 17 204 149 100 20 44	The cat hoped to find a friend that day.
44	164 170 98 58 205 48 26 112 19 161 44	If only I could own a nice car like that . . .
44	115 192 110 203 201 77 39 35 56 63 44	That needs to go into my collection

44	127 5 33 207 7 37 26 66 51 53 44	I hope that she gets through whatever is bothering her.

44	62 34 171 52 180 203 112 86 59 135 44	I love how this color makes me think of Spring.
44	165 73 9 34 96 113 19 20 74 213 44	this dog looks so hopeful
44	30 69 49 89 5 72 80 79 195 212 44	I hope I get to experience a trip like this one day.
44	61 117 48 215 178 139 121 202 77 130 44	His smile represents hope.
44	41 196 42 195 146 127 135 180 54 176 44	Oooh I want to visit this cool looking bridge!
44	133 107 35 150 42 215 185 159 9 166 44	One day I'll be on stage singing to a giant crowd.
44	61 26 109 85 2 141 93 139 154 104 44	Maybe he will find something for his owner

44	156 116 27 30 142 85 10 179 145 18 44	I would love to join their band, or at least see them.
44	41 25 23 117 128 20 99 126 164 67 44	I'm not sure what this machine does, but I am hopeful one day I will encounter it and learn.
44	151 166 19 75 180 32 42 74 148 146 44	I'm so jealous of all of those people who get to be out on the water.
44	145 191 213 88 141 163 3 50 65 31 44	My bank account needs this many numbers!
44	38 109 124 176 69 30 207 104 58 66 44	What a beautiful hotel! I would love to spend the night
44	10 119 199 163 60 102 130 61 89 125 44	The help is this picture is great.
44	47 200 194 22 93 203 147 132 126 206 44	I dream of someday being able to speak before a large crowd.
44	198 43 158 165 15 121 173 137 94 203 44	This location looks amazing, I would love to go there some day...
44	126 175 145 51 109 108 151 214 167 62 44	Oh how I would love to be doing this too!
44	60 61 88 124 168 209 84 162 106 5 44	i see the burning desire of this man that eventually lead him to the goal
44	117 155 182 77 188 55 183 195 5 37 44	I wish I took music lessons more seriously.
44	173 32 192 15 204 195 140 141 90 41 44	I have big dreams
44	215 13 191 199 58 164 53 141 95 28 44	Oh, that just looks so delicious. I used to love all that bread and pasta stuff, but I've gone Paleo.
44	173 120 175 187 75 99 43 115 105 28 44	I wish I knew what was going on, looks fun though, I want to go see for myself!
44	18 109 124 36 123 32 12 82 199 15 44	i wish I would have designed this
44	155 106 41 21 180 19 27 198 11 81 44	aww he is so cute! I wish him a very happy birthday and I know he will turn into a fine young man one day
44	14 185 61 73 183 140 104 107 39 162 44	I really wish that skeleton mummy would turn around and go the other way.
44	200 77 188 28 177 193 69 214 88 185 44	I wish I could be where they are.
44	18 166 94 78 158 77 182 121 82 29 44	What a great place, I would love to be from around here and clean this up
44	167 195 137 190 81 115 143 17 22 107 44	I wish we would stop taking over mother nature
44	138 166 131 98 8 88 36 61 123 94 44	That is my dream car!
44	96 189 80 41 196 107 30 169 154 71 44	I hope one day I can have a child as cute as this one!
44	102 76 65 137 122 98 31 214 170 192 44	Although the concert is held indoors, the lights on the ceiling look like stars.
44	52 71 5 145 28 179 101 203 188 68 44	By the time the firework fades, I will know if the person I desire loves me.
44	20 122 176 117 100 160 11 215 111 188 44	I hope my boyfriend buys me a flower like this!
44	140 12 39 197 31 131 207 123 53 182 44	I would not mind driving that.
44	67 23 80 184 199 48 168 186 164 195 44	I would like to see this in person some day.
44	184 22 56 148 147 72 175 118 27 16 44	I hope that someday the places I shop will be so kind as to hug me.
44	32 193 109 50 170 20 107 202 120 39 44	I hope someday this contraption makes sense to somebody.
44	92 156 74 55 19 13 179 194 206 123 44	Is that a doorstopper or what?
44	45 196 138 78 146 125 203 136 160 108 44	I always dream of finding cash in the trash!
44	96 20 88 106 22 169 145 153 91 12 44	It would be nice if I could be there to see that in person
44	155 97 163 58 171 123 30 194 133 82 44	I so wish I could visit you and Melinda in Florida!
44	21 5 95 2 28 17 35 114 161 24 44	I wish this event lasted longer!
44	164 97 29 63 5 138 115 140 57 136 44	I would love for all of us to be so happy.
44	112 6 120 38 78 50 151 153 144 176 44	I don't know who Reynolds is, but he should probably hire a gardener for his building.
44	106 127 53 160 193 155 210 55 28 208 44	I wish that I was enjoying a nice dinner with my friend like the people in this photo.
44	3 177 171 165 102 33 153 94 166 54 44	I wish I was there!
44	120 31 71 56 75 107 6 206 140 171 44	Wondering what is across the sea.
44	193 150 35 100 59 18 134 29 48 186 44	What a beautiful color...would like to have hair this color.
44	188 7 82 19 52 194 54 203 65 214 44	I WOULDN'T BEING AT DISNEY EITHER.
44	55 82 43 65 3 4 17 139 178 130 44	I would literally do anything for one of those. I want one so bad!
44	60 153 104 203 81 142 31 16 159 57 44	Ahh, I hope I get married one day..
45	163 54 41 14 11 165 72 180 118 142 45	A shade of green that I'm sure the paint designers worked quite hard to create.
45	121 90 201 68 168 116 96 144 89 95 45	I could only eat a bite
45	8 171 98 6 99 161 148 166 4 2 45	We are so little under this building
45	18 151 84 114 162 194 188 127 29 37 45	I'm no more important than these lives.
45	167 87 99 209 14 175 18 71 106 2 45	Paradise by the dashboard light.
45	126 87 101 139 4 29 54 177 110 34 45	That's about what I have in a bag.
45	27 75 160 51 65 184 129 86 159 204 45	I wish I was fit enough to do this hike.
45	19 198 68 55 40 18 147 15 64 125 45	I only wish I had the money to go to this location.
45	105 110 104 138 17 71 205 188 14 91 45	My window is ok for what it is
45	185 30 22 39 209 174 136 69 205 197 45	I could never take pictures as well as him.
45	170 186 16 131 61 93 40 98 111 141 45	I am in true awe of this view.
45	102 93 165 81 56 122 29 205 6 148 45	I wish I could jump that high.
45	111 22 140 170 206 215 10 159 119 85 45	I could never afford that
45	75 92 113 176 173 111 187 145 165 139 45	I could never do that in front of that many people
45	84 88 73 12 37 75 44 98 11 182 45	What a beautiful dog. I will my beauty matched.
45	65 36 42 105 59 85 47 48 183 32 45	These men make the game weather we like them or not so lets praise them.
45	7 16 98 184 202 54 5 1 22 137 45	Well the camera went a little crazy but it's fine.
45	136 205 143 98 92 119 148 70 87 214 45	Not the best building in the world but it is alright.
45	99 187 127 11 173 116 180 141 146 162 45	These ancient architectures show how closely related we are to nature.
45	156 142 18 206 72 215 44 81 83 36 45	Thank you for all of the positive comments about these carvings I did, but really they are nothing special and anyone could do them.
45	159 200 48 165 136 70 28 41 72 73 45	The dragonfly can fly at such fast speeds, it is quite impressive.
45	140 209 119 74 88 75 73 6 71 96 45	Looks like a novel I'd be interested in reading.
45	141 173 102 134 58 7 137 171 28 193 45	Em ThETVe HaVHto t CkLiCLso s , NdIeNFrIFTh WiTW ,DaDAt AeAgrAg At WhAWWhAW
45	155 128 9 8 17 53 36 177 195 16 45	This actually looks really well done.
45	13 202 153 102 12 195 68 184 24 154 45	In these small hours, I am reminded how big the world is and how small we really are.
45	147 10 65 146 25 49 183 163 135 82 45	This lime green tile... It's interesting, I could never paint something so homogeneous.
45	8 213 30 85 3 202 26 126 36 13 45	Thats a good picture. The expression shown is better than I could have done.
45	152 154 52 215 136 172 177 158 161 106 45	Making a costume like this an easy task.
45	134 177 171 187 60 167 15 144 64 155 45	Family is in the sea
45	155 207 184 98 197 188 200 167 191 68 45	Need more practice
45	151 195 141 186 39 127 115 187 69 46 45	These look really nice
45	152 24 46 50 205 176 41 160 75 26 45	beautiful image of man and his best friend
45	215 100 159 211 107 202 134 181 163 127 45	This reminds me that there were people before us that had to work much harder than we do.
45	127 16 65 21 121 145 88 63 131 8 45	This piece reminds me of days gone by.
45	52 85 44 141 210 112 48 98 131 171 45	The cars at this event which was themed around nice, fast cars really made me realize how simple what we have really is. I am grateful and pleased with what level of cars we have.
45	104 2 120 95 61 10 153 51 212 24 45	I think that those are some great books.
45	141 19 57 72 142 52 32 111 134 133 45	The plant is large, however the flower is modest even in it's vibrant color
45	63 43 92 137 110 40 86 84 93 205 45	This couple looks great tonight. They definitely blew my outfit out of the water!
45	49 103 208 71 19 10 54 205 138 91 45	I would not be able to walk across that bridge! Good for him for being so brave!
45	159 94 1 40 158 139 119 115 132 61 45	I must admit, that is very nice architecture.
45	134 62 80 56 107 100 122 41 144 189 45	I just love seeing the history of places, it really makes you appreciate how far we've come.
45	120 128 113 84 82 193 150 79 85 44 45	I could only hope to succeed someday like this graduate.
45	161 176 111 158 119 40 159 205 95 13 45	Oh, to be like a child again
45	150 3 91 26 86 5 54 38 125 102 45	I love the color purple.
45	50 6 55 25 113 98 182 71 1 166 45	I feel so small next to rivers.
45	11 70 71 134 58 132 63 24 42 95 45	You can always learn something from anyone in a crowd, no matter who they are.
45	30 96 126 164 72 110 118 10 83 180 45	This duck is gorgeous I want to feed him some bread.
45	59 70 168 79 154 121 187 32 203 41 45	I don't have any talent for singing.
45	155 161 86 13 179 132 23 93 135 117 45	i feel the night sky climbing my back
45	204 169 106 137 83 88 181 44 66 159 45	I admire those that learn foreign languages with symbol based language systems. How amazing.
45	164 137 30 42 127 109 165 203 13 211 45	These people seem to be having a great time, I love having fun
45	194 36 171 119 164 34 7 162 38 134 45	Very respectable signage
45	151 198 159 188 195 66 164 110 97 119 45	I admire the makers of this. I love this stuff!
45	95 139 183 87 114 53 71 92 56 117 45	I wish I had as cute a cat as yours.
45	108 31 167 59 3 160 18 105 135 64 45	i'm sure whoever made this post is an extremely talented individual
45	30 131 107 213 105 52 130 214 150 20 45	Someone is feeding that squirrel. That's great, I would never think of that.
45	68 99 152 33 49 64 100 93 4 138 45	This flower is prettier than me
45	211 55 183 62 15 123 1 73 112 20 45	I would love to have days like this with my kid.
45	171 55 32 134 190 209 154 74 25 76 45	SHE LOVES HER NEW PLACE BECAUSE IT SHOWS HER HUMILITY.
45	12 212 102 135 46 166 103 72 165 44 45	We should be grateful for the care available to us in our hospitals.
45	68 56 34 106 155 130 46 103 86 99 45	Playing music live is not something everyone can do well.
45	126 178 20 28 121 71 6 206 52 112 45	A good natured guy
45	104 69 35 199 58 23 215 5 64 21 45	She really pulls off the red hair better than I ever could.
45	31 83 28 161 78 7 120 9 124 107 45	A mother knows no bounds when holding her child
45	109 123 160 150 175 17 47 83 36 189 45	I could never take pictures as good as you.
45	4 33 161 116 102 183 96 72 198 193 45	Wow, just seeing this beautiful piece of nature makes me so grateful to live on this earth.
45	2 12 75 153 61 36 54 39 23 159 45	What a beautiful part of life. Such a small creature, yet has potential to become the most important human to ever exist
45	78 57 27 71 89 123 206 207 214 20 45	She really takes the most beautiful photos.
45	130 92 139 8 24 166 194 87 171 176 45	I bet this group of people is learning to be humble in today's world.
45	165 150 102 32 190 23 29 85 81 78 45	I wonder if I could play with him
45	19 115 205 138 5 129 123 51 25 53 45	I watch the sunset on my own boat, from a beach like that one.
45	71 80 150 180 68 134 157 133 149 151 45	I am grateful to be in your precense
45	183 36 105 29 196 195 115 21 43 149 45	These old ruins just stand as a testament that our ancestors were brilliant as well and that we still have so much to learn from them.
45	189 68 64 84 42 40 23 10 95 75 45	Another piece of history just deteriorating away
45	81 4 158 136 212 154 206 26 7 207 45	Only my master can do this
45	113 57 129 128 139 10 1 31 164 37 45	I was able to see that last week, was such a great experience for me and my team.
45	169 37 7 28 191 16 187 26 63 52 45	What a cute couple
45	75 122 63 109 172 158 146 76 3 114 45	In the presence of genius
45	71 15 188 158 136 214 97 10 22 177 45	What a fabulous opportunity for these young dancers to strut their stuff
45	204 150 201 47 60 196 3 53 34 128 45	I used to drive these, but it was never a big deal to me. I did it for the fans who loved to watch.
45	209 62 73 54 168 91 159 125 179 149 45	This reminds me of where I grew up, it was hard but I loved the community.
45	145 196 51 34 22 158 170 191 56 104 45	makes you fell small
45	9 10 132 13 67 201 189 124 138 176 45	I would like to adopt that kitten.
45	98 114 213 35 155 17 102 127 133 152 45	That girl looks like a good girl.
45	112 211 44 1 95 108 187 77 133 130 45	This woman knows her place.
45	201 208 16 44 154 180 121 25 163 128 45	They sat with each other with care
45	183 211 7 90 104 179 132 39 14 55 45	The sky looks cooler to me
45	178 188 83 80 69 97 187 1 127 110 45	What a lucky person to have a motorcycle
45	214 131 55 104 122 106 139 191 38 173 45	The landscape is very welcoming.
45	204 41 71 13 8 59 214 27 91 86 45	Wow, This really shows how big the world is and how small we are.
45	198 21 180 37 24 144 34 102 163 22 45	I would be so thankful to have a motorcycle like that, it least it will get me to where I have to be.
45	191 175 197 54 154 146 11 33 101 129 45	Honored to be here alongside Merlin at the Maritime Museum
45	119 209 116 156 110 78 34 190 207 73 45	And what a beautiful symmetry nature shows us, even in its most unseen places.
45	129 38 65 183 167 104 192 196 21 77 45	Puts things in its place
46	205 100 130 163 16 131 181 146 74 207 46	Let's be real, the home team is going to lose.
46	26 173 69 103 1 182 158 33 23 92 46	I am certain that this lake is full of crocodiles
46	58 3 130 76 43 34 26 201 97 93 46	That looks like it could be dangerous
46	189 166 44 110 82 148 137 64 151 210 46	This looks like a bit much just to protect from rain.
46	80 126 68 204 84 193 175 1 192 177 46	I've got to get a bucket before the show starts, water make feel seasick...

46	76 51 179 135 102 63 113 136 4 162 46	These penguins don't look very healthy - depending on where they are, they might not have lived for long after this picture was taken.
46	156 198 88 45 30 9 175 172 117 7 46	These people look tense and pensive, this must be an important meeting
46	29 212 178 146 194 33 170 129 73 26 46	Isn't that dangerous for the baby?
46	3 129 168 190 100 163 202 123 146 119 46	Art is so interesting, but does it really need to be displayed in such elaborate museums?
46	102 120 127 209 97 17 107 80 190 162 46	It's not a common sight to see a large stretch of land like this!
46	115 94 61 98 185 183 139 90 91 212 46	The bird is sitting next to the grass.
46	117 100 183 182 109 112 11 73 25 132 46	I wouldn't want that guy to give me a tattoo!
46	143 185 161 181 92 86 77 7 54 125 46	If someone left that garbage there, they should get a fine for littering.
46	36 64 191 199 207 113 179 197 14 175 46	She is going to work, where she belongs.
46	69 149 30 88 176 145 59 124 140 199 46	Interesting, I would like to see this in real life.
46	168 126 179 14 166 188 88 24 199 114 46	He's not going to make that shot
46	30 31 26 201 180 143 196 10 172 109 46	Absolutely beautiful view, it would take forever to reach the top of the hill
46	174 3 138 134 154 140 110 200 199 186 46	be careful you can fall
46	192 131 76 17 142 152 50 124 71 169 46	Meetings and delegation are the only way to get this done. Good luck team
46	211 77 88 144 158 14 134 121 15 125 46	Parking looks a bit difficult
46	127 70 89 6 2 125 153 82 97 159 46	All three of you are to old to play Quidditch  any more.
46	213 96 89 15 55 186 84 166 134 109 46	The dog came so close, the photographer should have thrown a stick first.
46	205 117 153 26 108 124 132 88 127 70 46	A refreshing look at the greenery of a simple garden.
46	74 41 173 181 150 73 127 12 70 201 46	She support him through everything
46	146 52 134 65 19 173 113 100 76 140 46	An interesting day as smoke rises over the grass
46	135 88 43 4 111 178 56 123 78 73 46	You never truly win when you gamble.
46	79 112 201 80 15 161 95 137 162 211 46	Alaska here I come
46	68 33 191 188 69 27 155 34 84 166 46	The men sit in the social club, coming to grips with their situation.
46	201 115 190 56 174 73 178 194 63 102 46	I bet this structure has been around for quite some time.
46	148 134 184 28 101 87 40 12 112 91 46	I don't think I'd go to see this, not my type of show
46	36 17 185 156 155 86 139 164 209 74 46	Hummus is a good source of protien.
46	117 164 84 78 37 59 130 114 215 180 46	the tree that had broken off and rotted just as at the point it emerged from the water was really creepy
46	111 20 133 192 2 145 1 109 49 125 46	A cute smile to a woman
46	145 120 131 118 84 127 44 143 75 142 46	I don't think a turtles eyes are really that big.
46	187 135 1 161 208 202 68 103 172 170 46	As if the character is there
46	183 165 173 190 98 106 166 112 147 117 46	The building might be occupied
46	95 65 150 142 5 94 215 170 28 193 46	Good day to sit out and enjoy the sunset
46	98 172 5 67 184 139 11 53 36 146 46	this will be a a challenge
46	191 213 85 122 70 95 214 185 68 62 46	I hope you know that an employer could come across this picture of you.
46	167 60 156 151 106 20 117 43 34 213 46	Forsure Storage For Used Be Could Building The Of Area This
46	187 17 75 45 167 60 117 30 204 85 46	your hair is so fluffy
46	49 101 8 32 169 156 67 20 26 200 46	Those children have no idea what they are doing.
46	70 114 69 11 160 34 214 21 121 78 46	This picture kind of scares me with that drop off.
46	133 153 53 169 118 183 103 70 129 194 46	It's just a green slate. Nothing else to it.
46	40 171 203 78 109 115 9 182 54 184 46	Pub lights- Pub nights!
46	200 134 139 173 3 163 121 129 126 66 46	That's too dark for walls.
46	108 29 214 182 121 54 198 153 64 132 46	I hope they know what they're doing with all those exposed wires.
46	124 162 214 66 141 47 73 44 26 138 46	That's a Big ego.
46	133 116 126 132 140 5 177 11 158 65 46	Their hairstyles are grotesque.
46	106 130 100 195 122 21 173 49 42 156 46	Flow into the river
46	199 179 14 38 148 176 145 36 197 195 46	this train is fast
46	44 56 153 157 52 174 71 98 92 79 46	Is it really Christmas season in that photo?
46	178 157 110 60 156 122 207 114 195 21 46	Still water runs the deepest.
46	52 168 146 17 182 129 170 73 98 206 46	With her strong arm, she probably hits many aces during her volleyball matches.
46	77 81 54 209 97 171 22 151 36 18 46	DON'T JUMP!!!   OH, HE'S NOT.
46	56 120 21 71 43 117 191 164 50 115 46	It looks like these people are celebrating a good day. Maybe a win at a bike race!
46	104 72 7 98 107 159 96 108 191 15 46	that bench probably has some good history
46	200 171 148 201 83 14 26 206 185 67 46	That is what life leads up to, Death
46	165 193 130 200 9 187 80 113 74 86 46	This horse and jockey had to have practiced a LOT to get this jump.
46	154 214 188 200 196 166 115 17 33 178 46	This is a classic car, the owner takes very good care of it.
46	5 214 148 30 118 24 76 202 86 164 46	They were so happy to see each other again and save the time with a picture.
46	151 184 10 193 66 90 45 180 175 47 46	What an amazingly beautiful creature
46	213 79 211 192 133 208 50 107 75 60 46	practical, pragmatic, matter-of-fact
46	60 151 66 42 142 64 43 84 109 161 46	its very looks good to me
46	196 174 67 207 44 78 116 113 141 188 46	This man looks like he's positive he's going to win.
46	214 95 155 174 43 59 102 110 92 203 46	Marriage is an institution that only works if two people can stand each other. Love has no real part in it... or maybe it does for a while.
46	16 165 159 100 151 134 167 67 82 208 46	He is probably tired
46	34 51 21 121 140 114 38 170 142 204 46	The architecture of these building i amazing. I'm glad they still exist in the real world.
46	151 93 15 191 50 12 56 110 129 183 46	The sky is cloudless, the tower seems like a good observation point.
46	108 60 206 146 59 17 24 19 195 83 46	What a beautiful view, how unfortunate one day it will be paved into concrete
46	211 48 1 102 59 156 96 33 166 90 46	The glare and photo quality aren't necessarily grasping the energy seen.
46	61 185 168 215 40 41 75 39 98 143 46	A practical way to read
46	62 74 130 141 120 14 91 87 170 208 46	that's too many jars
46	212 176 54 57 184 167 125 93 77 137 46	Such a cloudy day
46	142 214 66 93 29 114 195 119 141 42 46	Non natural hair color really seems to be the norm.
46	151 206 51 105 193 107 4 207 122 187 46	This isn't contrastive enough to be seen clearly from the street.
46	130 8 41 100 134 38 55 37 20 27 46	If they keep doing yoga on the side of the dock they will fall in eventually.
46	124 163 195 77 80 40 186 189 97 28 46	He looks relaxed for a competitor.
46	24 213 163 20 79 103 6 138 194 204 46	Looks like there will be a really mice dinner party!
46	27 108 102 195 147 120 156 160 10 104 46	This is a forest scene.
46	32 115 150 35 37 151 209 28 70 60 46	I bet those dolphins are exhausted by the end of their workday.
46	57 27 147 192 124 19 68 42 204 169 46	They really need to get started with their tent before it gets dark.
46	52 21 24 176 209 118 214 19 207 48 46	The ancient catholic pergola
46	17 34 96 186 195 72 158 84 143 88 46	Cars will continue to evolve, and that's fine.
46	172 105 24 155 3 160 99 193 147 179 46	It's amazing how much dirt a bulldozer is able to move daily.
46	155 208 82 96 119 121 42 150 165 117 46	Hopefully a truck will give her a ride.
46	174 39 180 120 182 10 101 137 214 60 46	That paint job will be really hard to maintain.
46	157 63 81 134 75 189 180 117 39 130 46	This girl must have some serious upper body strength.
46	173 92 3 177 40 41 150 122 87 137 46	The statue seems to be engaged in a religious gesture because of his attire and  hand positions
46	6 193 156 108 192 22 133 134 207 163 46	Very few people look good in costumes.
46	21 169 186 74 134 116 61 80 148 103 46	THIS IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PLACE FOR THE MOVIE
46	58 56 86 120 199 94 164 132 146 147 46	it is helpless
46	101 14 16 117 165 39 123 13 79 187 46	Although these products make claims to clear your complexion, I think it's all just a ripoff.
46	13 146 144 51 197 174 210 57 99 106 46	It looks like this bullfighter is going to get away this time, but some day his luck might run out.
47	186 40 194 165 2 152 115 199 84 141 47	He's wearing hand protection.  Not a real man.
47	77 122 203 92 82 129 86 174 9 71 47	Look a pedestal for my beer
47	46 138 128 57 41 143 5 81 42 69 47	Generations of incredibleness.
47	192 116 188 65 74 106 44 159 183 8 47	What a bunch of junk. They need to clean that up.
47	126 108 133 118 181 116 196 198 43 3 47	He should should push a little harder
47	169 129 197 146 5 170 111 28 9 87 47	Women just weren't respected enough back then
47	101 161 139 114 207 58 188 135 63 52 47	I used to run like this back before I got trapped in the garage door track and had to saw off my foot to get free because I was at my cabin in the woods.
47	123 190 212 156 54 142 74 159 149 125 47	One time, an alligator jumped out of a pond similar to this and tried to bite my friend.  I wrestled it to the ground, of course.
47	209 81 43 212 27 101 32 205 64 114 47	Students need to be challenged more by mentors
47	181 122 72 118 171 62 83 128 46 15 47	Looks like hes hready for some extreme skiing
47	25 152 99 143 24 17 95 131 127 73 47	Science is hard work. They may not have what it takes.
47	17 37 76 120 7 183 34 103 100 81 47	Raking all those leaves would be a good way for my son to build discipline.
47	159 111 213 199 170 204 161 94 120 69 47	Motorcycle racing is dangerous but they know the risks. If they get injured that's on them.
47	212 131 62 11 106 1 144 171 93 22 47	Stop holding that kids and teach him to work.
47	161 165 65 159 205 84 8 104 86 136 47	I am not scared of anything. I would be happy to enter that scary doorway.
47	61 88 154 139 200 164 123 168 187 119 47	I could swim the whole way
47	215 189 59 166 163 4 192 55 92 91 47	I could take that baby on in a fight.
47	113 89 119 177 75 88 169 82 98 16 47	I could take these chicks down in 2 seconds.
47	107 111 32 194 101 74 180 29 215 81 47	That photo looks very hard to take
47	107 101 3 75 135 102 140 184 7 13 47	I could take this elephant.
47	77 208 31 30 60 93 154 194 61 110 47	This sacred temple doesn't matter to me at all.
47	158 157 151 105 215 17 82 106 6 26 47	Nice try, you'll have to pry it from my cold, dead fingers
47	136 199 206 23 184 84 128 10 26 148 47	I am ready to go the Psych Ward.
47	58 158 109 75 157 193 20 165 110 178 47	Ancient Celtic warriors used to paint their skin this color before battle.
47	120 158 104 79 175 127 156 211 55 116 47	That is not a good font choice.
47	124 154 209 14 188 139 148 29 213 131 47	That building looks so depressing.  It needs a paint job.
47	102 53 54 85 99 94 77 36 86 26 47	That guy looks intense
47	206 128 80 40 93 6 185 125 4 182 47	I could beat them in a arm wrestle.
47	92 34 45 76 142 179 86 213 80 88 47	Looks hard to clean there
47	77 74 159 52 2 3 109 79 68 41 47	The ground looks really hard.
47	204 2 152 142 195 180 211 27 107 22 47	Bring it on! No human is going to chase me away.
47	201 61 124 31 17 164 60 67 158 109 47	I would chop down those trees to get to the top of that mountain.
47	182 27 96 30 56 141 50 186 4 58 47	What a cowboy you could say.
47	147 50 14 159 1 140 3 92 68 155 47	i could beat this whale in a fist fight.
47	50 178 128 29 109 52 69 66 65 45 47	It's hard to sell these clothes in the middle east.
47	63 85 161 18 170 30 100 66 61 72 47	See how macho the man is .He must be yelling .
47	65 120 81 22 52 80 3 57 64 157 47	Those buildings are tall, but I bet I could climb the biggest one in under ten minutes with no safety net.
47	23 153 134 2 169 166 32 204 105 158 47	I respect their ability to climb that high
47	214 164 127 181 84 132 177 83 208 111 47	i'm feeling strong
47	213 34 49 108 169 12 182 24 89 5 47	Look at that man in the moon looking down on us. Does he think he's better than me? I'd like to show him who's boss!
47	95 89 80 36 110 170 188 181 162 68 47	The cops need to figure out what those pallets are hiding.
47	45 200 196 65 42 212 38 177 141 35 47	These students all seem to be so lazy. Why aren't they more focused on their work?
47	173 118 130 98 53 105 206 189 5 104 47	Hmm...I wonder what the capacity is on that wicker.
47	126 207 160 184 75 215 17 186 159 106 47	[DISCONNECT]
47	161 179 147 159 71 98 165 131 61 162 47	I don't need a church
47	116 22 85 126 52 143 23 34 30 170 47	Friends debating each other sharpens the mind.The girl with the backpack knows to not back down when you're right.
47	70 150 83 64 207 37 170 28 48 140 47	he will be fine
47	138 100 27 193 30 13 194 114 9 33 47	Birds of a flock swim together
47	166 111 89 72 84 150 139 45 43 13 47	These musicians remind me of my wild youth! I had some fun time growing up in the south!
47	169 140 28 23 93 67 128 131 210 175 47	He will make it all the way to a touchdown!
47	67 197 38 69 58 119 57 25 163 95 47	I want to boo this guy off the stage.
47	172 94 119 80 20 69 125 194 99 64 47	the color of looking up
47	199 186 13 79 167 68 114 143 91 115 47	sketchy neighborhoods aint got nothin'
47	4 211 35 73 96 44 49 30 184 142 47	This rugged machine has spent many hours doing its duty.
47	211 201 120 25 145 202 108 125 79 147 47	The book looks terrible. I'm sure it's silly
47	36 184 33 200 155 157 90 46 207 161 47	I'm never afraid of heights.
47	92 125 9 143 165 90 66 94 168 160 47	This area is rough, it will be hard to hike in this area.
47	155 4 179 129 108 182 7 23 148 141 47	Polaris trucks are super heavy.
47	86 76 28 90 9 69 186 100 184 53 47	I just use my teeth
47	56 201 205 152 125 211 132 149 175 161 47	Those 2 of the left don't look like they are trying to hard.
47	99 153 194 141 167 53 195 32 115 174 47	She should let that child stand up to get his legs stronger.
47	120 112 91 137 57 214 72 146 20 87 47	Did you know that at one time this was supposed to be a building. They stopped building it for some reason and became and icon.
47	203 149 32 51 80 212 157 85 61 182 47	I don't like watches. They just get in my way. It's too hard to compete in my Karate classes with them.
47	145 154 175 126 15 138 34 201 172 144 47	The burned parts of marshmallows are carcinogenic.
47	6 46 27 115 40 141 169 78 190 137 47	That's a weak handshake.
47	50 186 123 101 160 86 192 142 133 121 47	Needs to give what she's sitting on a good clean
47	158 32 140 123 122 164 200 155 55 27 47	Newbie learning to play Guitar
47	144 93 24 135 94 202 158 14 26 81 47	Come on, kid! You can do better than that. Let me show you how it is done.
47	13 24 33 51 54 73 136 56 29 154 47	That guy looks like he's not very nice.
47	34 142 81 124 4 132 154 141 148 130 47	I don't think they'll win.
47	49 76 56 161 6 4 179 172 16 181 47	Looks like amateur night.
47	22 3 179 128 102 132 152 63 183 82 47	That lady doesn't intimidate me. I'm pretty sure I am in better shape than her.
47	179 184 165 44 9 106 176 28 75 82 47	I raised every one of them.
47	191 196 62 68 165 18 183 29 200 202 47	Flowers have to be pretty rugged to bloom here.
47	161 23 203 128 43 173 143 1 84 59 47	I could catch some big fish in those waters!
47	32 180 155 55 141 71 124 84 131 64 47	What a weakling, doesn't even look strong
47	164 61 137 83 75 138 59 50 35 101 47	Noway I can clean this in an hour
47	10 113 100 204 148 58 168 79 199 89 47	I would arm wrestle everyone here... and win.
47	151 101 25 121 200 163 183 76 94 69 47	That looks like it's going to be annoyingly loud.
47	106 67 189 145 25 120 17 26 207 36 47	She can make a heart with her hands, but she'd never earn my love.
47	125 136 81 210 60 43 71 104 69 191 47	this bark is very tough
47	13 147 179 143 18 57 5 58 98 51 47	I survived a car crash in this
47	127 176 156 162 68 139 50 172 209 122 47	Give me one of those lollipops, or else!
47	124 60 185 146 148 19 33 175 167 21 47	Move away from the wet sand before I pop you.
47	126 9 13 115 143 4 208 98 54 130 47	Bunch of rich guys wasting our time.
47	185 76 186 180 126 29 81 165 179 197 47	This building I could have built in 10 days with my skills.
47	67 66 40 41 123 9 84 178 137 16 47	I love the color
47	145 153 73 40 182 49 121 211 17 7 47	I bet I could scale the sides of those cliffs with very little equipment because I am very brave and an excellent rock climber.
47	172 157 51 97 79 179 33 135 165 96 47	she looks way too fat in that dress
47	174 158 196 79 37 3 211 199 84 197 47	They have to do a better job with signs in this place.
47	136 70 112 204 81 210 84 159 205 79 47	That doesn't work.
47	128 109 73 187 78 33 114 185 27 49 47	If you want to grow those right, then you'll have to read more.
47	81 66 51 53 35 201 164 11 36 113 47	That's my kind of animal, sturdy and takes no guff from anybody.
48	159 21 25 210 91 135 51 153 23 80 48	I dunno about this .
48	119 95 43 128 79 170 64 13 172 22 48	The stairs need to be done.
48	67 18 76 113 188 27 34 69 180 136 48	I love the nature surrounding this home, but I do not like the style of the home itself.
48	84 203 94 107 205 7 151 105 113 111 48	The document is upside down.
48	32 95 202 182 188 132 150 10 12 58 48	The image  was have the awesome climate and drizzling rain and the street lights are marvelous
48	34 1 76 186 128 57 200 197 134 161 48	funny, fun, friends
48	96 209 63 20 151 136 80 101 68 86 48	I literally hate the deserts, but then again I am cold...
48	12 51 16 84 92 192 100 9 166 31 48	At first I thought this was a cool photo, but I find it boring now.
48	202 17 207 186 203 195 166 122 215 158 48	Isn't he a little old??
48	81 214 74 157 204 137 95 59 115 90 48	These people are terrible drivers. What a disgrace!
48	205 199 21 65 63 98 165 196 71 146 48	I can't play chess, it  requires a very high level of concentration
48	115 12 86 182 73 121 7 63 104 147 48	Well I don't know if I would support a team whose shoes didn't match their shirts.
48	140 183 120 79 116 117 174 60 70 44 48	Without my coffee I get very irritable.
48	44 24 21 25 85 12 59 55 145 142 48	This is not an idea of art to me- it looks dark and gloomy
48	84 146 185 9 80 78 67 145 29 116 48	Are they little balls or what?
48	73 172 8 47 133 189 183 50 81 164 48	Cats are known to be quite fickle.
48	8 68 24 213 117 78 116 177 175 74 48	Never seen this before, wonder what it is? Whatever it is, it look interesting. Never mind, I figure its a broken down fireplace.
48	166 68 18 10 162 93 97 136 193 149 48	I'll have an ice cream. On second thoughts, I'll take coffee.
48	61 142 99 174 97 155 132 34 86 14 48	These are some lovely clouds! Guess it'll probably rain and ruin everything.
48	93 39 148 13 76 89 196 197 35 215 48	The one on the left looks smarter. Well maybe the one on the right.
48	76 96 187 213 200 156 51 88 127 8 48	I hope they get them out that water can be so tempermental.
48	105 49 77 42 186 208 90 135 99 160 48	This guy is cool. He should change his shirt though.
48	157 46 72 71 154 74 127 213 123 208 48	This makes me not want to go there.
48	215 164 111 42 126 57 80 121 162 174 48	51 degrees is too cold , 51 degrees is too hot
48	192 111 97 51 94 164 188 109 78 54 48	I actually don't like this piece anymore.
48	166 150 6 186 37 82 38 91 163 42 48	That should be just one piece that is stained not just a bunch of liitle ones.
48	42 1 208 71 81 74 8 91 205 142 48	These kids should be in school learning instead of playing a game!
48	215 214 31 12 183 103 172 14 121 7 48	Its bad because its not pure nature, but good for industry
48	137 38 79 177 68 182 12 60 155 24 48	you know, im not sure i like this material anymore.
48	8 4 205 181 146 73 120 169 212 2 48	should i take the exit lane or should i just take the highway, i wonder
48	61 108 63 171 140 19 39 30 53 193 48	Seems safe but who knows if that could change?!!
48	84 91 205 68 196 61 4 189 3 154 48	The baby looks calm in this picture, but I am sure it will throw a tantrum in the next moment.
48	214 169 185 172 129 103 10 201 91 125 48	Sometimes life is a real problem, isn't it?
48	139 111 103 28 12 197 61 118 195 177 48	There's no picture. Or is there - it's just brown... BROWN!
48	55 93 133 184 190 209 58 2 125 88 48	This is a nice landscape. Actually it looks a bit cramped, I don't care for it. On the other hand, the water is nice, I do like it quite a bit.
48	16 33 167 187 47 32 132 78 3 41 48	I could go forward or go backwards
48	33 103 122 9 4 208 207 152 117 61 48	nice color and nice tree
48	30 156 113 165 13 66 212 57 84 95 48	Sometimes can't stand the change.
48	165 155 100 181 174 153 161 183 45 86 48	I could draw better than that!
48	214 149 198 192 186 110 145 26 151 118 48	I liked the sculpture yesterday, but now I've changed my mind!
48	59 134 114 135 171 164 131 123 88 195 48	I would love to visit there, it looks so green but I probably wouldn't go for lack of public bathrooms.
48	106 108 13 10 82 125 23 15 183 60 48	THE SANDBARS ARE TYPICAL LOUISIANA.
48	137 92 135 189 174 134 11 212 45 62 48	There is no way I would do this.....well maybe I would.
48	139 105 157 212 174 205 198 124 173 82 48	I had sailing lessons, but I didn't go.
48	174 187 1 197 181 146 192 70 169 159 48	Sometimes I enjoy these birds, other times I find them annoying.
48	155 23 214 141 164 132 173 45 22 121 48	making a move in the heat
48	70 99 101 25 175 60 196 10 82 126 48	These sweet children, but I wonder where their parents are
48	110 162 122 193 165 180 148 119 86 13 48	I wouldn't drive this bridge, or maybe I would, I cannot decide.
48	137 152 41 46 108 98 87 79 56 102 48	The skaters are versatile.
48	150 114 7 180 118 46 147 128 162 132 48	I started off with a garden like this but them I decided to peruse my hobby as a sculptor
48	56 14 82 52 2 212 109 24 192 100 48	Doesnt she look like shes all that
48	180 142 158 114 56 132 110 173 9 140 48	I think the first girl is prettiest. No, the second one. No, the third girl is prettiest.
48	86 141 163 156 107 51 206 178 120 182 48	He needs to switch to English; well, maybe not.
48	210 89 120 129 175 119 6 171 86 67 48	I would want to do this, but it seems too dangerous, but also that thrills me.
48	174 208 215 198 119 93 78 148 41 95 48	there should be some activities for the kids
48	189 140 81 83 75 79 210 132 36 58 48	Looks like a good picnic. I could go for a picnic, or actually, maybe a swim instead.
48	19 82 210 96 72 3 161 24 155 152 48	That meal doesn't look like it's prepared quite right. Can some of the ingridgents be changed out so it's more appealing?
48	147 3 179 212 23 156 124 165 174 181 48	I want to wear that outfit
48	83 24 42 31 107 176 193 177 143 68 48	This would be a nice picture, but the sun kinda ruins it.
48	214 165 46 198 211 94 158 109 41 142 48	The water is constantly moving, just like all of us.
48	144 32 104 99 165 149 8 161 139 214 48	She better hurry up and take that photo before the dog moves!
48	150 16 136 134 102 155 106 100 62 45 48	On one hand, bikes are extremely dangerous but at the same time the DO look pretty cool.
48	76 6 16 170 91 143 71 144 18 55 48	Some days I am like the guy with the microphone, other days like that sad lady.
48	38 98 124 143 181 21 193 184 64 85 48	This place is always flooded.  Gross
48	27 39 170 149 94 150 76 21 8 55 48	I would love to climb that and look over the street! But heights scare me. I hate climbing.
48	46 14 195 8 145 130 54 39 131 18 48	I think this was before the game. Or was it after?
48	160 39 191 69 77 128 118 54 174 102 48	What a pretty hat! Although, it is a little much.
48	84 79 164 149 28 93 195 101 71 182 48	I wish it would stop raining so I can go swimming.
48	100 128 101 7 71 47 94 96 29 124 48	What a crazy old photo. I like the old architecture but I'd hate to have to maintain it.
48	189 34 179 148 212 69 167 47 37 163 48	I am not sure if I want to eat this.
48	162 36 27 28 26 182 148 83 196 197 48	I'd like to join the airforce, but I'm also scared to join
48	209 119 164 60 211 184 192 39 104 34 48	darkness with lamp
48	213 98 18 186 21 3 121 51 183 108 48	She was so happy to be there.
48	158 24 85 114 196 180 107 14 84 179 48	success is here
48	199 94 38 1 130 197 174 83 87 176 48	The trees look tropical but the weather looks miserable
48	36 127 45 15 32 87 26 29 60 38 48	Kids are cute, then again they’re making a mess. Get them out now.
48	4 92 7 209 70 91 90 202 114 15 48	I'm not sure how I feel about this tiger just laying there like that.
48	84 33 61 208 189 32 150 88 179 21 48	I'm not sure about these chairs anymore. Maybe I'll get some new ones.
48	195 82 194 126 131 85 109 64 128 92 48	I never want to come back here.
48	85 7 198 19 139 82 34 151 65 197 48	these wont be here for long
48	66 126 13 71 106 167 158 99 57 61 48	We should go to the top, no to the bottom, of that building.
48	130 181 51 47 97 186 198 157 136 137 48	folly well known
48	39 131 38 141 188 2 63 183 163 4 48	Not a good sport to play, you'll get injured, well maybe not
48	193 127 2 84 29 192 187 72 191 36 48	The paper was so thin.
48	153 103 57 211 2 131 71 14 24 102 48	I like the guy on the right. No wait, I like the guy on the left.
48	76 65 119 49 193 67 80 31 84 190 48	It's all going to freeze over when the sun goes out!
48	116 119 143 82 135 209 181 46 186 173 48	These leaves are great for basket-weaving.  Well, now that I think of it, maybe they are not.
48	147 36 190 54 140 205 6 139 39 69 48	I used to like cows, and now I dont, well maybe a little.
48	5 140 214 195 40 175 213 91 61 177 48	I don't think this crowd will enjoy Michelle Wolf
48	31 27 45 215 195 130 69 213 90 118 48	I told you to put your bike away
48	176 46 152 49 148 137 74 157 114 143 48	Well at least they are cleaning up.
48	18 71 149 99 62 151 38 179 66 88 48	This may or may not be interesting to watch.
48	53 30 45 43 152 13 148 156 130 21 48	Those tables and chairs should be set up differently.
48	109 53 117 148 44 181 164 18 11 85 48	Somewhere to run away from
48	136 113 4 57 112 33 186 120 122 107 48	A stupid picture of a tree, actually kind of nice, if you're into nature, but still worthless.
49	13 26 150 178 167 205 129 24 65 91 49	I bet this cost a million dollars.
49	139 60 100 133 213 79 85 113 27 39 49	This is only like $1
49	194 41 139 38 32 120 3 114 96 109 49	I bet those cards are carrying hundreds of dollars.
49	68 52 211 113 27 74 90 26 65 6 49	cold, wet, distant
49	83 193 152 105 136 142 92 106 179 76 49	He is blind
49	3 208 25 90 58 167 38 32 128 85 49	There is no way that photo is real.
49	204 87 42 50 62 9 3 196 152 135 49	My friend said his grandpa got 20 purple hearts in 'Nam...I told him to shut up
49	12 90 60 30 178 194 28 36 8 175 49	That baby should be able to walk
49	123 64 11 192 189 177 126 79 110 45 49	There's no way snow can be that bad there.
49	62 85 96 176 91 57 128 134 40 58 49	There's no way you can kill someone with a color.
49	169 64 183 73 88 74 165 196 193 141 49	The joy in this picture is overwhelming.
49	6 208 42 95 113 120 137 66 174 167 49	I think I'll buy all of the flowers for my girlfriend.
49	119 202 81 165 70 88 191 43 198 79 49	This plant looks menacing.
49	2 7 94 204 131 30 56 60 143 156 49	someone could see someone in the bathroom in there
49	60 197 136 26 107 147 63 5 100 155 49	there isn't a picture here
49	93 134 57 59 42 36 123 202 188 145 49	Why would someone put water there? That wasn't very smart to expect children to stay out of that.
49	108 181 188 50 80 37 95 16 147 117 49	This truck might transform
49	192 204 129 98 92 179 66 107 201 151 49	I can't believe they got away with such sloppy uniforms.
49	17 184 45 73 4 138 50 169 81 114 49	This fence has a mind of it's own.
49	70 10 67 3 100 123 6 174 215 172 49	Meet my grandparents.
49	174 68 73 199 202 61 88 148 40 205 49	Is that a REAL woman sitting by the rail there?
49	115 193 111 183 107 29 114 86 148 195 49	Is that Meryl Streep?
49	174 162 213 109 189 123 28 17 140 10 49	a maze of gardens looks so artificial
49	86 185 78 95 41 170 108 124 83 205 49	This place looks promising! I hope they have a room with a private Jacuzzi.
49	169 129 77 203 87 162 170 209 126 102 49	Her smile is too much.
49	99 46 173 83 71 27 123 38 24 94 49	This man could make a living as an chinese acrobat if he tried hard enough.
49	8 110 148 181 122 66 191 41 82 141 49	I wonder if all the kids in the picture are hers haha (including those in the background)
49	202 5 94 207 201 13 123 203 6 198 49	They need about 5 speedbumps
49	36 24 82 9 170 164 186 39 158 136 49	Smiling like your about to hit the gas pedal of a mustang
49	41 46 78 140 111 99 118 154 182 70 49	IT'S REALISTIC TO THINK THE TREES ARE GREEN BUT THEY AREN'T
49	45 164 10 99 158 165 210 128 18 59 49	I bet she's illiterate
49	163 145 15 104 11 154 111 89 130 88 49	I wonder if people would dare dive into this part of the ocean.
49	97 164 174 171 2 38 182 37 138 95 49	That truck can probably turn into a robot.
49	73 143 117 26 87 79 122 36 3 142 49	This would make a great pet
49	42 95 60 56 165 107 193 3 163 120 49	I think I see an alien!
49	206 133 208 166 205 81 35 121 122 38 49	This looks like a very hot place. I think it's going to be flooded with water very shortly.
49	38 62 106 210 151 119 104 71 209 48 49	What an odd mountain. Who could expect anyone to climb it?
49	68 183 118 147 149 208 99 154 36 206 49	This looks amazing.  If I lived there I would do this climb every day!
49	88 151 2 161 116 164 38 75 37 27 49	I'm pretty sure this was probably a river or stream at some point. Look at the indentation of the pavers.
49	47 136 130 35 73 39 190 175 91 193 49	This house would make such a cool pool! Imagine if we could fill it all up with water!
49	24 128 104 72 170 161 13 146 204 29 49	I bet over one million people show up for the opening.
49	98 148 131 97 197 70 126 208 27 187 49	The odd bend of the trees make me question reality.
49	133 193 203 139 125 148 17 100 30 170 49	I think they are all sisters.
49	42 84 193 50 9 114 4 159 66 35 49	That seems like they're floating upside down.
49	106 44 36 172 206 105 178 212 189 110 49	This Koala would make such a perfect pet!
49	90 41 173 128 45 145 209 66 146 104 49	this man is a giant!
49	16 103 143 133 67 12 92 72 5 173 49	Maybe the water evaporates instantly.
49	45 203 206 40 147 97 19 110 65 85 49	Losing weight this way is hard.
49	152 38 146 150 68 162 46 15 148 151 49	I love the ocean. I wish i could live as a mermaid!
49	44 128 71 183 14 185 211 10 56 107 49	You might think its a hot tub, but I dont think any coeds will get in with you.
49	92 194 112 174 132 57 100 197 32 163 49	[DISCONNECT]
49	67 52 9 90 55 82 30 21 89 186 49	I bet they could fly off of that cliff.
49	102 176 208 138 161 164 66 146 26 179 49	She should let me give her a makeover!
49	133 11 74 93 203 187 61 82 100 194 49	If she is dating him she needs to look at her life
49	180 62 134 187 127 119 202 40 103 213 49	If I went there, I would probably turn into a bunch of lines.
49	193 177 83 32 132 129 195 192 135 4 49	Oh I could stack those cans higher than your house even after drinking each one!
49	86 152 110 70 145 106 113 184 197 16 49	Hopefully that child tapping on the glass at the bottom knows he could kill everyone if he's not careful.
49	147 81 44 182 10 118 117 89 99 150 49	Is he going to drive under the ocean in that thing?
49	169 100 104 170 4 175 122 40 195 27 49	alien invasion is happening
49	3 115 93 128 97 67 163 206 150 77 49	this doesnt make much sense to me. what is it
49	159 164 60 29 152 79 68 100 37 57 49	That kid will definitely be a star!
49	129 22 124 6 88 143 106 152 9 10 49	Does he have six fingers?
49	56 128 209 110 38 24 2 153 27 211 49	I bet that girl has 20/20 vision without glasses
49	97 55 154 89 189 90 74 6 109 200 49	Do you think any of them is famous?
49	195 141 191 161 78 36 201 125 209 40 49	These bikers will be biking for 10,000 more miles.
49	160 206 169 96 124 6 33 42 159 165 49	I could climb this building
49	214 18 24 51 106 150 129 160 79 40 49	these guys think they are actual crime fighter...
49	209 155 4 15 43 194 114 173 90 137 49	I'm just waiting for my friend to come back with the bread crumbs.
49	103 153 150 139 213 67 14 144 192 73 49	You should show a whole field of yellow flowers with just one red petal in the middle.
49	193 67 116 18 50 189 206 93 141 52 49	All of that empty space could be used as a spaceport
49	200 89 113 37 66 45 211 42 209 63 49	I could jump that
49	43 28 99 79 121 191 36 157 200 55 49	Time to upgrade that computer, I suggest the top of the line Mac. It's not that expensive.
49	146 110 148 71 155 134 198 24 124 212 49	How long did it take her to put that makeup on? I think the photo is fake.
49	208 196 51 131 110 88 45 32 31 33 49	They're definitely turning the wine and wafers into the body and blood of Jesus right now. It's just like a magic trick.
49	146 106 120 1 11 157 97 128 185 155 49	But can they fly?
49	35 43 133 117 86 193 144 164 159 158 49	Impressive stuff. What can't these kids do?
49	201 38 182 82 207 55 178 148 41 42 49	I could easily pick up that phone and take over the world in ten minutes.
49	21 128 61 188 10 41 34 1 122 215 49	This is a real flower
49	131 149 193 153 148 164 204 26 32 86 49	IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THE BRAVERY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS.
49	112 68 166 74 9 123 8 186 52 75 49	Is that a blue tree or an old statue?
49	72 97 75 77 27 113 101 58 185 107 49	Man I could eat a whole pound of that!
49	113 154 190 210 211 116 1 166 13 42 49	should this guys beard to be  white.
49	135 29 169 75 190 55 200 162 28 144 49	There are way too many people in that line. I would jump off the side and swim ahead of everyone.
49	137 151 175 177 118 89 115 67 5 69 49	This place looks fake. I think its CGI.
49	13 213 30 43 93 44 186 104 170 119 49	There is no was people dressed like that
49	209 80 27 68 12 26 122 55 179 46 49	This is just unreal here.
49	126 90 84 152 197 72 155 89 38 177 49	I'm sure that color doesn't belong to this world
49	34 120 197 118 77 87 180 183 123 67 49	Thousands of babies protest!
49	105 106 187 110 142 188 66 79 192 24 49	bet hes a millionair
49	36 187 37 13 17 101 162 215 155 93 49	I think that packet dropped out of a plane and landed in her fingers perfectly like that.
49	169 133 158 94 56 195 150 101 25 211 49	When all else fails its amazing to see there is someone for everyone in this world
49	52 191 99 87 88 25 22 189 207 140 49	I bet the rolling stones are playing there!
49	60 115 39 145 50 138 153 116 42 13 49	A 3 year old baby made this
49	39 104 28 61 4 119 134 211 209 67 49	I will look like this someday
50	174 155 180 173 87 46 145 150 152 71 50	There is nothing to a car going in a circle.
50	185 179 198 41 131 151 117 92 12 2 50	That wall is probably used to defend the soldiers.
50	13 18 212 140 47 168 63 185 184 215 50	This is an aesthetic display of art.
50	20 209 87 200 191 4 90 144 45 113 50	It the same thing everyday in this town.
50	88 135 71 33 55 174 205 87 80 176 50	The photo needs more light.
50	148 6 106 116 111 22 36 4 17 54 50	Looks like a typical townhouse.
50	107 169 10 106 3 98 23 37 183 44 50	This looks like a bridge apparently.
50	88 47 2 139 108 33 187 69 1 8 50	Here is simply a lake
50	28 168 27 70 93 129 84 185 22 177 50	Well that looks kind of grey doesn't it? I wouldn't want to eat something like that
50	15 197 94 14 82 7 179 132 103 173 50	A table is a useful object.
50	41 23 64 156 155 141 154 167 58 42 50	I hate untrimmed yards like this, no order to it, so disruly.
50	28 36 209 191 179 185 24 101 178 200 50	two guys trying to act.
50	149 14 82 98 161 66 178 24 170 132 50	I'm just the roadie, I really have no talent except getting them home safely and stopping them fro making rash decisions. Kinda boring
50	212 78 128 140 71 162 37 192 68 159 50	Raising your glass to nothing.
50	170 36 53 70 210 35 160 165 114 21 50	This picture's blurry. I can't tell what's in it.
50	47 184 194 174 209 75 105 215 210 102 50	these are white flowers
50	25 36 32 73 121 15 63 126 138 142 50	Thats a man and a women.
50	36 113 57 160 190 172 135 65 15 148 50	This is a sad situation for these people.
50	85 67 167 57 32 165 83 186 170 177 50	There a several children. They are wearing red flowers on their shirts.
50	95 105 91 180 47 188 144 165 145 147 50	Yeehaw cowboy get er done
50	192 37 140 202 52 148 124 68 106 105 50	Skating is lame.
50	150 118 116 4 143 20 40 48 21 72 50	fantasy, empathy, undetectable
50	162 31 192 84 97 35 146 33 210 181 50	What kind of bug is that
50	73 28 21 31 124 132 48 93 190 40 50	A baseball player.
50	94 118 37 28 98 134 1 55 212 25 50	This is blank.
50	6 150 8 47 197 38 5 48 12 92 50	Looks like a great place to be.
50	34 106 69 183 196 179 126 163 82 28 50	A bug is sitting on a green leaf.
50	153 69 35 172 113 136 137 63 59 111 50	Very nice picture
50	131 89 94 19 34 152 159 78 129 96 50	what is this supposed to be?
50	175 186 161 176 126 59 33 128 73 207 50	what else do you do with donuts
50	32 100 145 40 208 171 57 141 192 85 50	It looks like that is a male singer.
50	19 188 49 85 47 21 136 61 91 207 50	I don't see anything but a black wall. Boring picture.
50	119 67 2 84 95 43 98 12 187 176 50	Just a bee in its natural habitat doing its thing.
50	203 151 197 30 135 33 51 132 181 85 50	[DISCONNECT]
50	206 117 204 6 150 177 190 124 72 137 50	Seems like a dark city.
50	202 172 24 154 11 150 67 78 43 199 50	I like hats.
50	118 112 136 179 163 156 122 80 29 206 50	Dogs do not like to eat human food, dogs are just canines.
50	59 13 112 193 56 44 43 181 45 47 50	what could they possibly be doing
50	4 5 212 174 119 59 49 113 73 60 50	i don't htink this ad is very creative
50	195 185 57 83 110 127 182 9 62 166 50	this bores me
50	196 38 78 128 149 36 207 201 10 168 50	I don't get it. Whats he suppose to be? I'm just confused.
50	108 163 212 203 70 20 29 112 16 63 50	Boring. Are they getting paid to stand and play annoying sounds?
50	136 28 111 27 120 137 108 2 67 34 50	[DISCONNECT]
50	168 99 63 10 157 180 183 89 125 193 50	This is a mountain.
50	62 209 207 126 74 32 129 120 40 26 50	Why do people like touring this river? I can't find anything exciting about this.
50	183 144 147 172 191 58 2 135 9 152 50	Just another imagine of a city skyline
50	134 44 75 152 80 49 3 186 203 204 50	That's a lot of tree branches.
50	17 99 3 133 209 148 192 175 20 47 50	This picture is mostly some shade of gray.
50	152 112 72 45 126 163 90 215 110 92 50	This just looks like a desert.
50	142 97 45 66 106 174 9 32 187 36 50	Our relationship is one that is unimaginative.
50	150 151 36 102 89 188 182 141 192 125 50	i have a headache too
50	3 70 82 211 48 187 137 162 103 120 50	Bunch of rocks, innit?
50	170 132 181 213 69 100 208 3 112 84 50	Lizards are just not my thing.
50	48 180 163 152 131 84 210 49 27 37 50	That water isn't deep.
50	93 188 169 92 39 210 187 53 102 158 50	You're out of ink.
50	116 92 63 99 81 215 103 11 202 44 50	He is happy.
50	165 46 200 56 187 157 147 38 27 173 50	They are running
50	100 73 3 94 43 19 41 103 131 193 50	The girl is sitting on the chair.
50	121 137 46 36 111 83 214 64 17 96 50	A group of men are standing around facing a building.
50	96 1 161 183 18 144 87 206 141 13 50	This is very simple and sheek
50	56 113 68 136 32 143 190 144 125 182 50	It looks alright but I wouldn't go there.
50	171 141 38 212 111 73 155 114 67 196 50	Looks like some students listening to somebody.

52	41 153 50 15 152 179 72 60 35 6 52	I could jump off a 100 ft building with no safety equipment
52	215 123 152 3 67 200 62 25 32 4 52	foolish, fun, calm
52	204 211 202 18 133 140 122 48 56 7 52	That pup is stuck outside that is animal cruelty!!!
52	49 109 135 107 10 79 57 92 158 124 52	What a waste of time.
52	145 84 200 30 186 41 11 56 123 49 52	This guy is looking funny with that face.
52	101 210 148 47 38 43 80 118 170 157 52	I can not believe I am out here in this tight outfit trying to pretend I'm actually fit and loving this!
52	179 29 183 87 128 41 169 133 102 9 52	Taking American jobs!!!
52	166 57 48 159 180 164 179 8 123 153 52	I can't believe we broke in to his house, let's rob him.
52	134 163 130 49 74 214 98 198 167 215 52	I bet the this house has great heating and cooling
52	56 85 29 163 102 210 170 181 129 88 52	I am sure I could use these boats on the open ocean
52	36 120 201 77 105 159 164 18 129 147 52	Bicycles fly like a plane
52	121 171 103 163 82 77 7 155 194 108 52	Only idiots waste time going to church.
52	108 116 184 128 167 136 110 60 130 59 52	Wow that's a nice dog!!!
52	174 74 111 114 178 68 101 56 166 108 52	That dog is goofy looking!
52	118 50 123 100 19 68 137 45 113 27 52	Looks like a stadium being built.
52	51 50 47 128 141 179 6 147 203 180 52	This looks like a valuable painting.
52	205 135 39 73 81 49 61 169 38 129 52	How long did it take to build this place?!
52	30 163 33 151 140 118 213 200 212 15 52	She could jump up
52	101 36 201 168 37 5 24 33 116 98 52	Lol, that's hilarious.
52	167 45 97 172 84 103 185 166 193 68 52	This has to be photoshopped because the sun and moon can't be out at the same time.
52	32 144 126 201 171 72 181 28 71 14 52	Repeating old problems under new ownership.
52	49 172 106 99 84 1 203 17 4 59 52	Wonder what these silly statues are thinking teehee
52	83 65 31 88 32 144 58 71 42 147 52	Ahh, they must be partying so hard!!!
52	140 37 145 39 58 131 165 54 160 162 52	Those all look like they're thornless.
52	148 177 195 105 184 57 2 153 5 145 52	Is this a tugboat?
52	43 81 204 37 6 213 211 94 10 95 52	I'd hate to get my foot caught in between those.
52	49 114 101 57 87 178 107 182 168 127 52	Are these berries edible?
52	173 88 75 42 50 192 84 124 134 169 52	What are they all playing Fortnite together or something?
52	22 34 186 164 28 162 214 90 192 128 52	What a good looking pizza.
52	39 165 197 213 41 168 109 202 38 20 52	The website is overreaching
52	74 177 169 57 145 40 111 72 202 20 52	Such a disorganized kitchen!  I hope they won't become sick!
52	163 191 171 213 214 102 83 188 160 156 52	Those clothes are unneccessary
52	141 53 41 186 105 68 26 143 100 215 52	Mans best friend
52	165 55 85 24 152 91 110 13 163 50 52	I probably shouldn't prank this police officer, right?
52	99 51 165 110 145 49 43 137 213 48 52	why are they doing this?
52	84 119 70 118 87 110 156 209 30 88 52	Time for a swim.  Who says the local animals are vicious?
52	210 178 23 171 59 172 68 206 175 11 52	Haha those men are in a parade
52	45 102 91 16 164 130 40 209 9 51 52	Looks like theres some flirting
52	170 32 193 117 4 58 84 157 102 177 52	I could draw a lot of googly eyes with that pencil.
52	185 188 166 96 157 173 209 159 178 59 52	Using tools you don't know how to use is not wise
52	205 67 196 80 194 72 30 2 100 138 52	I think your mom said the same thing about you.
52	125 16 66 61 27 53 15 154 186 103 52	The projector should be on the floor
52	177 38 66 28 104 164 86 87 25 151 52	That type of painting will never sell, it is simply not colorful enough.
52	167 96 99 43 29 124 37 60 46 32 52	you cant do that
52	3 49 80 158 25 170 89 69 76 61 52	give him more pens
52	156 33 18 7 49 158 74 180 185 126 52	Is this a cupcake?
52	45 101 133 164 212 39 23 207 68 125 52	[DISCONNECT]
52	15 167 125 25 206 187 29 123 185 177 52	He looks a bit wit-less
52	77 199 105 109 129 121 148 63 70 95 52	I would like to sail my boat right into that storm on the horizon.
52	121 96 204 5 210 156 115 161 70 61 52	I bet that truck could knock down that tree.
52	45 75 104 203 179 162 150 62 155 76 52	The seafood looks as if it has been sitting outside a while. Should I take a bite of raw clams.
52	154 211 199 166 187 83 165 23 14 41 52	Is that green?
52	182 20 73 215 28 119 168 187 161 87 52	The boys were playing around with the fireworks.
52	11 48 20 181 151 77 155 145 9 115 52	Driving takes all the attention
52	32 89 103 13 166 10 173 167 73 175 52	He would be crazy to not have a life vest on that boat
52	9 27 81 106 22 154 114 211 65 115 52	Who is this statue for?  Is it a local hunter?
52	61 196 55 190 179 108 10 25 140 136 52	Looks like my house
52	190 37 208 49 201 95 85 89 17 121 52	I can use that blade to cut that usb. Make it work better, perhaps?
52	211 48 1 45 131 189 186 86 157 42 52	He played a lot of Wesley Willis, despite his grandmother's objections.
52	46 91 152 21 189 108 145 193 149 90 52	C'MON PONY , LETS WIN THIS RACE.
52	72 103 94 107 214 207 86 42 201 98 52	The flowers were dying.
52	186 138 66 159 113 60 17 196 114 120 52	a stupid looking music band
52	80 27 155 189 82 64 214 165 106 134 52	Why wear two necklaces, and why wear one that might attract bees!
52	53 92 136 156 17 101 173 152 27 114 52	I am gonna go join their party and start a dance,
52	74 182 27 164 3 142 179 157 28 187 52	Who would have a cross on top of a building.
52	121 37 102 8 31 191 161 193 49 157 52	Now I'm absolutely going to park here.
52	98 107 133 171 164 33 99 136 80 115 52	What if I locked people out.
52	100 152 93 154 203 194 137 71 62 76 52	42: The answer to life, the universe, and oppresive dictators.
52	27 10 95 91 206 19 78 82 87 105 52	He looks like a fool to climb that high....
52	61 89 45 131 50 125 6 20 30 182 52	These flowers be budding.
52	206 213 166 68 53 150 143 122 137 198 52	Why are they wearing hats?
52	139 115 132 188 176 8 144 175 66 74 52	Oh my God, what happened to the rest of her hands?!
52	39 74 28 5 211 198 98 83 23 160 52	They all have their legs crossed haha
52	45 183 189 207 118 61 120 194 158 125 52	That is such a silly picture for this company.
52	127 159 85 77 71 147 176 82 28 205 52	i want to ride this bicycle on a sea
52	62 109 173 135 196 192 2 141 205 69 52	I can't tell if this was suppose to be blue and someone made a mistake.
52	17 101 13 122 206 208 68 111 78 203 52	Wow! That piece of food looks like the picture. I bet they will make a bundle from that.
53	186 60 178 102 74 106 181 121 12 192 53	Wonder if those boats could join together like transformers?
53	99 36 64 22 204 165 81 199 174 136 53	You shouldn't just fall asleep on another person's bed ike that
53	23 132 151 141 25 58 172 47 15 186 53	This looks like my backyard lol
53	37 16 111 47 130 147 17 29 143 62 53	Come on girls, lets put an end to this gorilla warfare!
53	181 95 51 135 173 85 13 52 104 55 53	Those are the ugliest curtains ever!
53	159 24 94 155 55 174 128 131 185 75 53	We might as well step into disneyland!
53	108 40 55 47 8 77 5 89 178 182 53	Why aren't there balconies? People won't fall will they??
53	156 162 18 29 102 9 170 131 13 165 53	I could put this image on a t-shirt.
53	12 71 95 182 59 101 11 165 22 193 53	They should coat the building in gold leaf.  It would look so much better.
53	111 127 151 14 107 116 167 118 73 61 53	Such an odd shape lol
53	134 87 118 6 123 85 111 59 110 120 53	Yesss girls! I would love to be there too!
53	20 51 43 9 178 163 199 212 21 187 53	Why would you need a steering wheel with a nice seat.
53	21 8 149 97 65 67 62 100 122 203 53	Can you count the birds?
53	144 165 128 210 139 212 39 176 101 138 53	Oh look, it appears the guy in the orange shirt has just noticed that he is on camera, smile!
53	146 16 159 51 202 64 81 8 166 179 53	I wish I could cut vegetables that well in the dark.
53	15 69 104 58 113 142 145 117 133 196 53	You going to unbutton that
53	18 97 20 171 39 24 176 48 208 126 53	Why do people waste time on desert islands.
53	92 100 177 17 162 18 32 65 197 38 53	I would steal that car and drive it right out of the museum!
53	130 69 33 174 76 100 184 127 193 49 53	The lit up tree looks out of place and ridiculous.
53	196 18 199 191 107 108 15 7 200 214 53	I hope someone danced with the fish.
53	199 89 41 133 22 48 110 206 190 55 53	Eye see you.
53	121 148 28 60 67 42 88 16 201 85 53	It's a little odd that there are so many working and so few customers.
53	103 124 68 22 188 6 43 60 101 148 53	Is that a Halloween costume? It's cute!
53	202 139 184 66 91 127 38 72 19 8 53	Where's the sand? Where am I supposed to lay and tan?
53	27 93 177 117 159 144 150 51 19 178 53	flowers here, flowers there, flowers everywhere
53	156 162 142 144 189 182 87 27 197 118 53	Hey, plenty of oranges to fight of scurvy!
53	167 168 134 4 85 19 11 192 193 139 53	four eyes ready?
53	64 83 70 80 146 63 175 152 14 180 53	one item floating amidst a wet ground reflecting the sky is useless to photograph as there are more interesting things to photograph.
53	157 96 159 56 86 74 63 170 209 123 53	Not sure what im looking at but it looks like fireworks!
53	29 120 76 23 112 38 4 177 174 146 53	Guess I'll buy candy also
53	166 110 48 113 126 154 175 65 159 89 53	that looks like peter pan's boat
53	38 40 162 5 4 190 119 30 170 74 53	thinking about cleaning windows
53	11 192 205 111 113 89 159 183 155 98 53	That'd be a great place to have a boat party.
53	163 109 26 178 23 209 167 135 66 61 53	Someone needs to hire an exterior decorator.
53	205 55 203 37 62 140 132 119 79 215 53	Oh, I wanna go on a boat party.
53	174 84 181 156 140 125 185 36 42 193 53	That's a waterfall, a big one that is
53	116 117 214 26 40 84 190 119 172 132 53	There should be more decorations on that bike
53	47 187 156 99 54 205 206 96 103 29 53	Cool scarf, man!
53	137 83 144 118 201 96 152 84 194 1 53	WHERE YOU CAN GO DOWNTOWN
53	35 117 191 201 38 98 14 17 56 28 53	If you want to be my lover, you gotta get with my friends.
53	183 157 46 37 178 91 29 127 191 185 53	Brush your hair before you leave your house.
53	177 23 122 188 192 40 83 203 181 205 53	How about some better posture?
53	1 55 113 75 130 195 205 111 176 17 53	Wow, he's going fast! Bikes are super cool!
53	113 120 175 203 182 94 213 180 99 137 53	This is just a pictures of blocks.
53	85 215 68 148 119 81 34 78 22 98 53	Why do some have crutches and some do, the 3rd guy will beat the rest easy
53	83 86 108 12 156 143 113 90 170 39 53	I have seen prettier scenery than this. This looks like anywhere in America.
53	120 43 26 159 105 9 109 74 5 158 53	What a weird looking fence here.
53	30 29 141 52 40 118 193 56 101 54 53	Would love to ride through here on my bike in my clown costumer.
53	176 32 130 56 98 175 119 195 79 198 53	It looks like a really tall guy with a sheet thrown over him is carrying the plaque looking thing. Anybody else see it?
53	6 88 92 93 91 48 215 73 153 167 53	I wonder if I could climb to the top of that
53	134 6 91 100 8 59 50 141 45 77 53	Camel be thinking... "Can I eat that"?
53	132 20 138 205 170 141 28 122 110 104 53	I think that striped shirt looks bad.
53	162 104 15 125 88 25 212 93 170 47 53	They definitely are
53	81 186 56 58 145 37 61 68 172 19 53	What a silly expression.
53	64 210 194 20 134 148 204 112 76 141 53	There are different people chatting to each other
53	57 124 146 66 19 110 201 41 198 183 53	How many people are here?
53	187 124 202 189 201 24 9 70 175 192 53	Haha, I bet the driver of the plane likes to smoke!
53	153 82 11 131 18 4 140 144 156 16 53	I'll race you to the middle and back.
53	74 156 193 204 43 96 92 169 113 181 53	It would be pretty funny if we attached a bunch of old, dead fish to that net and stunk the place up!
53	66 142 204 86 51 102 208 176 30 143 53	He is going to spill his drink
53	178 211 113 117 51 135 187 93 29 109 53	THE PRICE TAG ON SIGN ADVERTISING IS ASTOUNDING.
53	4 75 31 202 57 77 147 121 143 104 53	What a nice place to do extreme bikes.
53	81 72 153 148 2 197 34 23 135 90 53	He should have cut it with his finger
53	90 19 212 38 102 48 185 135 132 181 53	Oh yeah- go long!
53	10 189 168 38 1 154 12 33 27 64 53	I wonder how long it would take to climb to the top of that pole!
53	134 25 96 30 143 1 21 84 178 75 53	what a mess
53	153 41 57 84 48 110 155 136 76 182 53	Three poor benches died tragically in tidal wave of plants.
53	212 20 116 47 173 91 148 40 35 6 53	Oh hey it's the 76 finger coral!
53	30 168 115 51 36 153 94 116 210 14 53	This flower brings the life to this picture!
53	134 125 38 88 138 136 15 28 206 47 53	This set up is silly

54	23 9 73 184 87 59 45 144 171 34 54	A part of the wall is still standing while the rest lie in rubble. Did the workers just call it quits and drop their work load near the base?
54	16 60 123 157 67 36 112 139 149 176 54	I just signed this hot new K-Pop band to my record label.
54	171 199 184 27 18 116 29 51 94 175 54	This is peculiar.
54	174 167 210 215 51 209 173 100 7 87 54	Blue, bluey, blue.

54	96 88 119 177 178 138 70 176 62 142 54	I love this curtain design!

54	109 173 105 53 145 47 98 67 181 106 54	I can't pass up a red button without pressing it.
54	108 173 96 46 55 15 177 1 87 154 54	This DJ is something of an enigma.
54	57 4 102 210 35 157 19 213 72 68 54	Why are her hands in that particular pose?
54	111 98 156 161 76 125 6 142 173 40 54	IT WAS ODD BUT SHE FARTED DURING HER PARTY.

54	186 196 83 34 102 23 160 201 139 74 54	I wonder if anyone has been attacked by bears out here in these woods?
54	25 187 209 14 40 211 169 94 67 117 54	too much boring information
54	40 6 188 73 150 162 3 28 84 125 54	I think I live here
54	207 158 80 18 6 153 55 149 102 88 54	what a weird scarf
54	87 174 125 119 75 206 121 91 49 112 54	Giants not welcome
54	2 58 27 168 153 4 167 67 172 12 54	The satellite dish looks a little dated but it could be because this is in another country
54	27 213 150 176 187 135 215 26 126 30 54	I wonder if that lady walked across the lake after this was snapped.
54	47 98 206 165 141 53 166 86 215 71 54	What is she taking a picture of?
54	178 169 26 1 76 204 15 67 116 201 54	They must be hunting rabbits.
54	185 31 173 165 190 142 33 39 34 167 54	They need to put roll bars on go-karts and race them down mountains.
54	25 27 188 170 176 169 61 189 135 73 54	The strange moment when you know you have to sneeze, but can't

54	182 16 163 78 25 33 82 80 36 60 54	A bizarre looking building
54	106 36 78 74 200 83 92 143 7 198 54	This is so strange. I am a box car with a picture of an airplane on it.  Maybe It wants to be an airplane?!
54	183 206 207 100 50 73 141 40 134 98 54	The leaves have turned, so it must be spring.
54	130 112 63 156 113 105 71 99 205 116 54	are these aliens imitating a band?
54	183 189 47 12 185 41 107 146 103 87 54	Let me grill up some burgers while I charge my car lol
54	103 145 159 83 137 206 150 25 61 135 54	This is like the biggest baseball field.
54	184 10 11 95 154 107 108 159 98 59 54	She looks like the statue behind her
54	7 187 64 72 24 30 201 199 177 56 54	My favorite uncle in his debut play
54	58 24 9 157 3 40 64 8 68 205 54	Yellow boats are better than these.
54	150 61 155 78 71 72 172 203 62 9 54	I love the way her hair flows to the keyboards
54	31 75 207 68 168 199 43 66 202 59 54	I want to marry this thing
54	213 16 107 138 209 193 9 157 196 114 54	The way they are running isn't normal.
54	169 125 120 53 14 152 9 27 32 171 54	This is weird. Does this place look like this, or do I really look like this? What is Pince?
54	159 170 191 140 133 131 53 75 40 207 54	I think this is so weird.
54	87 172 186 110 147 105 16 184 150 174 54	I mean, I made that shirt, nobody should take it from me
54	22 90 20 156 95 111 8 124 19 137 54	This is the color of the shirt I wore when I went to the bathroom party.
54	60 32 69 197 80 6 160 209 89 175 54	Some would say this paintings is very Odd. Art can be very Odd, but that it is up to the one who interprets it
54	86 204 67 47 7 150 161 184 18 77 54	What a weird cat, lounging on a bench.
54	124 172 105 185 102 112 103 38 92 15 54	Lets all do sleep with glasses.
54	124 42 21 93 91 67 89 3 101 207 54	it's odd how uneven those rocks are.
54	181 72 144 78 139 131 92 39 108 163 54	That guy isn't even watching the car
54	8 65 21 202 109 207 11 115 173 4 54	Try hard. Sit on each other's face hard.
54	19 63 83 66 103 80 99 29 28 42 54	Tell Cant I But Off seems Something
54	9 204 191 1 14 84 64 200 39 112 54	Is she being attacked by her grandchildren?
54	188 46 163 62 168 65 103 110 185 29 54	The day is unusual
54	70 77 13 144 138 79 30 44 136 23 54	I think this is a jack in the box. \
54	90 207 188 36 2 89 58 189 187 154 54	IT'S WEIRD THAT THEY PAINTED THIS BUILDING ORANGE
54	111 36 76 85 107 69 199 86 109 179 54	what is this
54	1 129 15 37 212 199 192 25 93 122 54	I mean, it's a blue square. But what is blue, really? Do we see colors the same or is your blue actually what I consider purple? Who invented the word blue? I like turtles.
54	110 169 186 31 98 206 9 189 134 203 54	The open door beckons to me. The prancing pony awaits. Perhaps it will speak to me.
54	163 139 140 170 201 59 68 32 84 52 54	the alignment is strange
54	214 75 173 6 49 161 109 168 210 50 54	The grass will wither but its beauty is forever.
54	120 71 91 42 118 170 125 97 173 108 54	Reminds me od Alice in Wonderland looking down while being so tall.
54	92 49 31 86 56 116 67 186 209 97 54	I wonder if he has farted recently...
54	75 177 94 200 26 21 119 109 44 142 54	Why are their clouds?
54	115 60 122 58 154 139 197 199 50 120 54	I think it is a cold day on the lake.
54	44 68 121 197 46 108 92 142 36 149 54	what a strange building
54	144 16 181 69 68 66 109 60 45 1 54	WOA clean hands or what!!!!! Perfect time for bonding.
55	44 79 9 51 66 90 113 161 207 160 55	Someones trying to get them to look.
55	56 210 211 189 83 76 151 167 22 15 55	Those houses are awfully close together.
55	199 19 66 205 101 30 98 94 138 114 55	I don't know where this is. Cuba?
55	212 132 155 27 183 195 210 205 44 12 55	So many people walk by this building every day.
55	158 115 41 47 7 107 6 86 61 137 55	Soldier reenactment scene.
55	85 16 151 202 180 3 118 122 187 63 55	Nice blue sky but otherwise a meh picture
55	59 80 174 214 93 87 189 7 15 26 55	This is simply another sunrise photo.
55	162 164 84 72 96 38 193 181 214 156 55	Speak and Spell I believe.
55	108 17 48 158 87 82 75 52 153 148 55	It a beautiful picture that they all worked towards, if you like this sort of thing.
55	11 112 91 17 193 25 84 165 140 198 55	This is someone's art piece.
55	155 91 149 186 72 39 41 40 187 146 55	That is a pink rose in a beer bottle.
55	68 89 64 65 34 35 138 100 190 102 55	All of the members of the panel are negative
55	125 181 9 1 97 120 130 39 176 170 55	That table cloth looks like my grandmothers
55	60 159 200 14 81 214 139 90 27 201 55	Yeah, it's fine, I guess.
55	71 105 111 118 67 37 12 48 196 97 55	Security can be both a bad thing and a good thing. It helps keep people safe but also makes people feel unsafe because of the need for it.
55	71 167 198 159 153 23 76 35 144 163 55	A bridge between
55	151 37 108 27 168 51 10 9 127 90 55	An intriguing work of installation art
55	126 148 178 193 41 204 146 195 93 116 55	well i guess they have to eat
55	22 21 159 207 135 40 80 11 203 65 55	He is really holding that microphone.
55	95 143 59 163 82 188 207 6 116 203 55	This is far from air conditioning.
55	66 163 90 143 77 193 98 104 203 42 55	why would they even put a plant there
55	128 110 104 195 79 68 105 20 102 168 55	The bird in the back is likely having an easier time with this flight.
55	59 112 207 117 100 138 7 98 113 176 55	OK - it's just a kid playing. So what?
55	128 180 6 110 30 86 159 103 195 17 55	This seems like a good area to get some air
55	106 132 138 20 178 100 180 17 3 22 55	I see taupe.
55	184 209 90 183 97 89 148 52 196 119 55	This stand looks like it's kind of boring.
55	20 61 39 193 198 195 165 70 88 96 55	I'm not a huge fan of this Irish band
55	33 35 117 90 187 60 101 71 86 207 55	spider like legs
55	53 31 12 110 170 150 79 163 122 190 55	This lady doesn't seem happy.
55	120 157 5 92 75 163 17 166 197 32 55	That's quite out of focus, but I think it works well.
55	111 85 180 5 38 34 75 35 117 184 55	I just wish they would get this craziness over with.
55	156 172 26 57 212 203 48 35 49 132 55	Too small and cluttered for me
55	64 80 3 18 207 139 37 131 144 215 55	What a nice horse.
55	210 93 172 206 141 87 84 170 202 198 55	Th buildings are built at nice straight angles to each other.
55	5 47 175 188 99 174 158 212 39 11 55	I hope they all drown.
55	72 48 151 81 80 115 176 152 184 117 55	I am not attached to these characters.
55	58 201 87 78 15 106 59 18 75 66 55	This piece of land is covered in green grass and surrounded by trees.
55	48 53 185 44 128 167 49 191 141 107 55	That city looks okay I guess.
55	186 204 9 198 173 189 36 109 125 26 55	Just another day
55	186 175 200 27 78 122 33 181 46 164 55	I wonder how the festival has been here.
55	113 210 188 158 169 138 61 75 2 182 55	Okay picture of sand close up.
55	206 59 130 184 85 120 17 167 9 139 55	Nice dock for boats to dock in to
55	214 31 136 148 160 62 106 197 102 130 55	Do not need to live with them anymore
55	95 45 71 43 78 114 80 203 58 196 55	The lights aren't really twinkling; it's just reflections off the camera lens.
55	107 36 7 86 82 91 15 51 65 78 55	They are probably selling something in this photo.
55	18 109 127 75 20 42 123 120 17 52 55	THESE FLOWERS ARE A NEAT PART OF THE FOREST
55	4 38 70 110 49 179 147 34 45 111 55	I should probably go sit with my family, but I would rather check my phone to see if there is anything interesting.
55	122 166 36 160 189 194 51 131 4 101 55	That's just an entrance to an old mine. Nothing really that spectacular.
55	125 104 210 163 171 7 28 30 211 115 55	This bridge looks rather dangerous. I think it should be fixed so that more people can use it.
55	124 129 166 89 130 183 214 62 25 142 55	That's a bright light.
55	72 57 197 46 5 208 183 114 58 86 55	Should have used better detail in the background.
55	62 26 20 88 204 200 64 74 37 189 55	I don't see any people, I wonder where they all went.
55	148 77 120 3 163 97 48 156 121 189 55	They look older
55	92 33 52 188 19 175 100 48 5 124 55	What is it? Just some leaves, right?
55	88 3 105 103 159 58 95 86 40 33 55	This Color is alone
55	50 193 3 203 115 104 178 154 117 84 55	There it is.
55	71 91 178 41 147 84 73 131 128 42 55	im not trying one of those
55	23 14 119 162 64 86 99 85 151 182 55	Why is that guy looking away from the camera. Come on dude.
55	195 154 138 14 12 48 133 25 60 63 55	Not much to look at.
55	66 124 136 163 38 21 89 44 23 10 55	This picture is colorless and misunderstood.
55	86 175 133 33 26 39 134 5 146 166 55	This is an ok color
55	111 72 160 5 123 165 118 41 148 164 55	I guess I could eat this but I'd rather eat something else.
55	88 160 33 182 38 74 154 173 103 41 55	I always thought the lighthouse seemed further away. Interesting.
55	122 37 120 39 114 71 92 27 189 96 55	Boyscouts are objectively a bad organisation.
55	124 46 214 89 141 13 110 182 105 187 55	The water is green.
55	134 172 22 200 18 185 180 198 60 12 55	There are eight monkeys here.  Or nine?
55	68 66 10 156 18 91 124 83 36 97 55	THIS GUY IS MAKING A SCENE WITH HIS DRINKING HABIT.
55	52 150 106 97 23 67 123 101 28 43 55	Helmets often do not protect against concussion.
55	13 152 204 50 209 1 129 171 60 158 55	wonder what they are doing? it looks like they are having fun
55	3 64 128 76 179 28 109 12 207 19 55	I have a neutral stance on Rolls Royce’s even if they are Phantoms
55	200 154 172 80 118 9 69 212 151 103 55	Who cares about these flowers?
55	15 102 43 175 13 18 202 184 19 61 55	Just a picture of some braided yarn.
55	198 191 160 86 41 92 79 90 152 20 55	I like both billboards just the same.
55	214 17 88 2 137 18 61 60 84 52 55	The cute seems quiet impartial to the plant.
55	102 35 122 84 36 117 46 71 207 92 55	I don't see myself attached.
55	87 1 144 85 161 168 110 64 106 14 55	this looks like a normal flower
55	29 171 73 148 213 7 131 96 184 210 55	I think the green team scored.
55	164 151 161 189 155 135 24 65 48 13 55	It would be hard to see the TV screen from a distance.
55	201 154 80 210 36 164 194 8 95 52 55	I wonder how they make sure that everything is safe.
55	206 77 175 53 22 183 121 47 26 96 55	bye old house
55	156 167 96 197 205 12 49 196 91 161 55	Looks kind of boring, but if that's what you enjoy, go for it.
55	178 176 137 140 122 141 194 136 143 127 55	just another day in florida
55	53 27 118 76 141 182 54 142 190 107 55	One of the world's natural wonders
55	5 167 182 114 143 56 107 9 83 129 55	There are fourteen green pieces here.
55	117 82 54 165 109 181 185 139 188 196 55	I guess these guys could come to my wedding.
55	2 80 169 64 128 51 26 152 123 98 55	I see that the ocean is very blue here, but I don't feel anything when I see this image.
55	6 28 154 15 38 2 85 59 8 47 55	What a beautiful place.
55	18 71 26 199 35 96 76 130 189 125 55	Definitely nice people, I would trust them
55	204 145 161 191 26 91 34 116 89 108 55	Score is tied in the last quarter
55	98 191 101 66 213 166 10 110 210 30 55	More fried chicken,
55	17 203 153 148 11 155 9 3 21 118 55	Nothing wrong with the view
55	17 152 16 212 63 78 140 23 85 147 55	The sculpture is very precisely carved
55	154 19 2 33 104 30 186 191 29 197 55	Steam engines never interested me.
55	113 37 105 15 45 210 159 75 203 171 55	I believe they are observing a religious ritual outdoors.
56	164 52 123 20 106 87 130 213 102 186 56	I'd love to be on holiday in a warm place like this! I can imagine the sun on me now!
56	45 151 190 74 67 92 77 49 84 201 56	High five, whoooo, high five high five
56	66 97 174 68 165 209 50 83 41 24 56	Im gonna go run a mile after this
56	175 65 72 192 184 200 103 99 36 12 56	I'm super stoked to try some authentic Thai food!
56	47 163 134 172 60 115 127 58 39 149 56	This young boy has so much energy.  He just loves running around.
56	125 54 29 69 178 109 18 50 82 68 56	Yay! We won! Ice cream for everyone!
56	140 97 157 150 195 10 201 46 43 149 56	There is so much unseen energy hidden in forests.
56	187 155 4 71 157 13 19 196 26 169 56	What a funny pose of the bird, I want to grab my camera and take a shot like that!
56	35 206 16 81 102 98 191 148 69 154 56	It's a beautiful day to finish my book.
56	123 171 176 40 103 212 33 189 188 47 56	I need that outfit. It looks so comfortable and classy.
56	55 36 194 64 148 187 149 83 192 134 56	You're so lucky! I would give anything to be there!
56	66 98 180 102 93 153 38 10 193 127 56	The two women consult with each other for courage.
56	97 91 103 119 168 3 167 166 197 155 56	Watching hockey always gets me really excited and pumped up
56	161 102 39 69 78 146 72 135 212 136 56	I bet you 5 bucks i can get there in 20 min running, yeah go.
56	104 168 37 84 67 83 178 202 24 116 56	There's something invigorating about being in the great outdoors, where a person can just let loose and run around, without having to slow down for a pedestrian or slow moving taxi.
56	211 204 75 51 54 45 88 201 133 87 56	I have the energy of a 5 yr old
56	108 135 17 50 214 19 175 26 16 201 56	what an amazing view!

56	175 193 167 135 37 98 12 116 168 63 56	Nothing like going to the pier with your beatle and a keg!
56	100 48 43 187 210 22 25 179 156 161 56	That child wants to get up and dance!
56	111 16 98 191 186 51 123 166 35 104 56	Terry's music always makes me want to dance!
56	123 144 131 192 132 67 22 55 71 187 56	This looks like such an exciting city!
56	52 146 161 175 154 179 210 100 170 114 56	Let's pull an all nighter in the city tonight!

56	113 55 37 83 31 53 12 117 141 61 56	I can jump over the bridge
56	72 154 15 54 57 92 24 213 177 128 56	A road for good skating
56	8 208 110 68 41 207 182 125 60 169 56	We have come to show our support to our favorites diver!
56	149 82 54 67 59 144 137 60 41 19 56	I bet that little boy was all over that dance floor crushing it! You go!
56	100 51 61 201 146 45 151 125 115 168 56	That kid has been running to much.
56	149 58 179 188 90 183 124 141 197 126 56	I'd love to do my 3 mile jog up and down through this tunnel.
56	153 35 20 92 132 182 78 108 93 117 56	Next time this happens, remind me to get my picket sign too!
56	208 140 100 209 134 142 130 127 30 110 56	That's a fast looking plane, I would be excited to get to my destination!
57	37 192 54 153 12 188 95 48 17 199 57	This will end in a fatal accident.
57	155 28 87 191 76 130 174 103 109 19 57	I think I'm to jump out of that big window and just end it all.
57	200 150 152 95 74 71 80 84 206 9 57	A little strip of green in a polluted and dirty city.
57	141 139 122 175 37 180 25 164 214 166 57	I hope she opens her eyes soon to look around.
57	156 174 102 147 120 10 159 45 127 161 57	Reminds me of how bad fairytales end sometimes
57	172 143 32 207 125 187 147 80 184 162 57	This lavish hotel is the site of numerous celebrity suicides.
57	162 190 6 206 209 180 21 20 88 169 57	I think this lady's singing is killing me.
57	7 148 66 131 105 36 86 34 9 25 57	They're gonna fall and hurt themselves
57	15 113 153 52 134 46 18 178 107 199 57	Uh oh, this doesn't look too good! Very complicated
57	138 207 174 87 198 162 15 113 90 67 57	The bridge is very long and narrow.
57	79 89 49 53 4 158 77 202 24 29 57	Probably a funeral
57	65 33 53 42 38 185 199 139 63 158 57	Some people love clowns. However I think they are scary and not funny at all.
57	196 137 178 168 104 159 50 172 199 120 57	What a dark and lonely city.
57	55 141 66 140 138 51 11 32 203 201 57	This image shows a group of people playing instruments, but is there anyone to listen?
57	137 166 160 148 48 104 18 194 43 215 57	If the fire gets too big the people will get burned
57	107 120 34 155 122 38 98 164 12 192 57	Flowers are blood-red.
57	183 7 196 11 9 143 68 23 124 113 57	Accidents waiting to happen
57	198 6 50 93 145 66 91 22 12 122 57	A lot of people could die trying to cross this landscape.
57	213 121 120 50 195 158 189 142 5 54 57	what are they signing
57	148 121 191 56 199 116 88 204 5 168 57	This picture is strange and creepy. I have no use for it so why does it matter?
57	153 168 38 72 159 122 40 196 167 149 57	he only lost a tooth in battle ? it should have been more.
57	107 7 123 53 161 92 81 153 158 5 57	Dark shadows, overcast on this gloomy day...time only meters can tell.
57	120 14 147 87 103 94 98 36 202 192 57	A snapshot of future generations.
57	186 32 161 167 11 91 180 202 35 173 57	My life is going nowhere, my job is miserable, and i'm going to be alone forever.
57	171 76 168 17 42 156 130 194 183 92 57	It's a sad day for these athletes.
57	97 34 65 23 102 163 151 72 192 194 57	This building looks highly depressing.
57	29 32 135 20 48 148 199 140 52 56 57	You could use any of these to strangle someone.
57	118 185 117 10 193 192 39 54 106 171 57	Are those rocks about to fall or is it just me. I don't know how I feel about this picture/
57	188 79 198 181 167 96 189 32 80 160 57	Those two little girls are happy today, but they have no ides how hard life is going to get.
57	69 94 70 75 74 32 137 191 72 176 57	Hopefully they do not freeze to death.
57	100 68 206 203 52 140 109 78 23 16 57	I see those two are mourning the loss of their dog.
57	87 108 183 146 72 103 212 118 120 149 57	Those ladies better not get too close to the edge there, they might fall off and break a neck.
57	62 137 67 156 81 6 91 101 136 157 57	The people who made this are dead
57	41 18 3 34 60 132 214 79 160 17 57	So this is what our future looks like
57	98 197 144 62 116 106 159 194 95 11 57	You really have to wonder about our role in the universe when meditating in such a place.
57	49 3 104 164 73 20 91 16 56 189 57	Whoever wrote this is probably dead
57	74 134 213 50 11 8 150 81 212 197 57	this will be my last vacation
57	17 98 200 105 44 161 134 184 151 185 57	Weird how by the time we've all seen this photo, someone in the frame has probably received terrible news.
57	106 34 38 182 140 118 172 72 162 61 57	What the poop is this?
57	163 58 44 111 174 118 162 46 77 65 57	After suffering from a heart attack, this is the last image he saw before the ambulance arrived.
57	112 148 210 17 187 158 1 34 73 208 57	Time isnt a celebration, its a weapon wielded by mother nature.
57	76 123 138 146 163 29 33 213 135 206 57	He has some harsh looking pills
57	39 132 60 189 8 173 99 35 160 122 57	Hopefully they don't drown...
57	212 214 56 48 35 126 1 168 46 118 57	It will all be dead soon anyway.
57	184 11 199 82 203 91 201 137 12 46 57	This is not going to end well.
57	3 184 14 140 147 206 164 117 45 198 57	Many deadly snakes roamed the area.
57	86 212 30 100 207 12 73 37 174 46 57	Oh, I hope none of the horses escaped.
57	90 133 76 33 26 213 61 121 206 160 57	is that a burglar?  is he a kidney harvester?  oh no, its the tainted candy van driver man!
57	6 81 64 144 196 197 211 7 69 99 57	They are not going to win.
57	36 95 112 152 26 120 199 64 182 187 57	These eggs look weird.
57	195 189 211 113 69 128 149 93 66 134 57	It must be hard for people who live far from the cities to make a reasonable living.
57	114 44 105 169 132 127 176 93 145 5 57	It's a fair bet that someone will key that beautiful car.
57	133 135 204 165 142 212 184 22 78 117 57	Ones Loved Passed Or Lost Long Of Name The In Created Project Art The Was This
57	154 61 179 62 191 18 112 185 86 189 57	This is probably inside a death tomb.
57	109 134 38 173 176 102 129 161 95 119 57	It was only after I heard the bad news that I started drinking.
57	177 33 208 201 138 88 142 39 45 175 57	What a grim evening.
57	211 71 2 105 78 166 195 175 173 212 57	[DISCONNECT]
57	205 77 178 207 10 126 91 212 142 75 57	These children don't know that they have no future ahead of them, because the Earth will be too polluted in a few years.
57	211 98 122 113 204 55 106 75 91 28 57	One really has to wonder how many souls this cold landscape has claimed despite being an attraction for entertainment.
57	205 75 10 36 19 124 113 211 5 172 57	This flooding can only mean one thing.  Catastrophe.
57	167 143 36 196 35 66 127 84 211 105 57	this doesn't look good
57	154 206 139 85 27 39 136 92 128 131 57	I like that tint on the black. It goes with my suit.
57	191 163 147 168 207 16 156 105 86 67 57	That rope could be used for some bad things.
57	184 189 50 172 103 122 187 32 192 203 57	that dog is going to freeze out here
57	27 168 99 21 124 23 212 177 2 141 57	This is whats wrong with the younger generation
57	149 169 115 92 122 100 3 18 120 56 57	Things don't look good here
57	48 56 67 153 96 141 129 135 146 5 57	The towers seemed to never end.
57	193 82 35 173 62 8 107 211 22 5 57	I think this is very ugly.
57	64 129 30 163 41 201 6 146 175 4 57	I am doubtful of this child's future.
57	66 80 125 15 11 102 165 201 161 114 57	The beautiful flower is dying.
57	95 200 89 215 6 113 87 70 33 206 57	Too blurry, but great.
57	88 47 150 10 97 35 77 166 64 171 57	All of the black interrupting the beautiful background image makes me think of death.
57	150 83 8 92 134 43 85 106 36 190 57	we're all the same, like this little plant
57	212 183 50 66 142 158 201 194 71 165 57	something different and attractive
57	7 103 71 89 160 88 206 108 24 205 57	Is he having a better time than his son?
57	21 190 173 11 182 123 34 147 28 98 57	This reminds me too much of my last job where I wasted so much time in airport traveling and no time enjoying the places I went to.
57	79 15 14 27 105 58 99 159 45 215 57	I almost died from diving here
57	163 211 105 20 142 133 150 186 146 129 57	That looks like quite the mess to untangle.
57	64 99 129 169 52 12 37 75 164 51 57	I can't believe people are still having kids in this day.
57	36 84 19 139 16 209 99 4 86 156 57	They need to keep a better eye on that child in the stroller and who gets near her, anyone so close to her can and probably will get her sick.
57	127 16 53 27 126 96 166 39 173 110 57	This is our last gig for awhile. Hope I can make next month's rent.
57	22 172 36 83 20 59 6 91 131 3 57	THESE GUYS WILL NEVER FIND GIRLS.
57	96 183 69 169 80 143 127 166 40 47 57	Very boring colors
57	206 144 192 161 210 138 47 195 88 83 57	America is dying of obesity.
57	121 141 15 46 62 203 64 74 152 56 57	One day that sun will never come back up
57	23 102 145 38 181 39 14 125 115 59 57	This over cast sky makes the city look scary.
57	201 214 24 200 67 193 198 163 164 6 57	I think this vehicle isn't pretty.
57	166 92 185 87 202 72 71 56 13 122 57	One wonders if this is a sad representation of our future.
57	174 47 18 208 7 129 34 13 104 103 57	Is he at a funeral?
57	115 62 4 79 73 76 58 105 49 52 57	I wonder how many people have fallen to death off that wall.
57	38 2 213 19 137 3 59 108 61 8 57	SOmething bad happened there
57	211 103 118 89 210 18 198 207 152 97 57	It looks like someone died here
57	86 83 142 169 78 127 26 114 99 41 57	This meeting doesn't look promising.
57	144 205 11 103 83 138 30 81 176 160 57	He hasn't got much longer.
57	151 211 20 2 154 15 12 69 16 126 57	The image appears like a blank blue rectangle, just like your soul.
58	149 97 38 164 60 144 83 71 98 20 58	Big things are happening!
58	50 20 136 43 21 49 88 157 96 55 58	Wow, what a lovely design! I want this on my wall!
58	63 196 70 201 162 11 186 143 87 79 58	This would be a neat place to build a waterslide
58	62 210 15 75 168 21 79 65 150 176 58	She was having a really great day and was sitting on this frog statue and then a puppy came along!
58	131 66 13 140 147 18 24 161 108 206 58	Imagine what this scene would have looked like pre WWI?
58	96 80 144 141 6 154 26 202 32 45 58	A little sandpaper, some paint, and you'd have a beautiful new marquee.
58	112 171 155 169 73 130 145 162 206 70 58	Was this man determined to bring down the corrupt senator through his penetrating investigative journalism? Or was he just hungry for a doughnut?
58	76 9 164 108 109 124 8 184 106 90 58	You could put a huge zipline in there
58	90 81 82 75 150 193 55 130 135 129 58	Somebody has their wings
58	37 136 200 189 68 8 169 65 128 114 58	Those leaves are a perfect amber orange.
58	81 125 150 9 18 194 55 49 16 72 58	Fuse the fabrics together
58	149 202 190 42 74 80 84 113 200 108 58	Everyday style during that time was simple and functional. I might be changing my look soon.
58	10 40 117 1 100 34 65 191 187 134 58	This could totally be a painting. That horizon is breathtaking.
58	128 44 102 156 24 198 151 52 183 189 58	This would make a gorgeous subject for a painting.
58	212 195 54 119 126 56 14 188 34 4 58	I wonder what kind of play they are putting on here
58	124 11 77 132 99 130 126 182 198 6 58	I just love the contrast of the curves in the building with the straight lines of the dock.
58	184 97 213 181 164 169 92 166 200 77 58	I wonder if this could be a lego set!  That would be a great toy!
58	135 143 193 167 22 153 150 5 125 24 58	Family and blue sky are so inspiring!
58	63 153 56 129 172 136 141 14 140 69 58	The geometri design is amazing, I'd like to create something using all shapes like that
58	93 34 12 212 91 99 67 23 28 127 58	The black and white make this picture more memorable
58	192 72 153 61 200 132 116 30 104 54 58	That brick work is so pretty!
58	23 126 97 213 191 214 79 124 99 94 58	This guy has been painting with cigarette butts
58	161 141 135 118 132 69 108 95 115 193 58	Im going to write a new song
58	174 38 98 41 27 44 146 197 177 156 58	I would like to draw something like this on canvas
58	144 165 170 127 92 215 66 142 77 101 58	Looks likes a comfortable place to sleep.
58	42 120 84 157 49 169 105 167 145 166 58	What a spectacular waterfall, I bet someone could paint a beautiful painting from this gorgeous photo.
58	188 98 89 101 106 205 32 94 159 78 58	It is a little jester.
58	171 95 182 162 59 173 66 54 1 206 58	There are a myriad of ways to express yourself on the hill.
58	100 134 107 137 189 49 192 136 39 14 58	I bet I could do something nice with her hair. Add some clips. Would keep it out of her face.
58	163 175 26 38 36 46 215 88 3 76 58	Biggest mountains , super time to spend with family and snowboard and ski .
58	93 3 51 95 146 190 32 174 189 179 58	I feel like I could make a beautiful portrait of this valley.
58	45 175 68 54 19 87 8 137 142 97 58	We should make that design into a hat or different products!
58	70 55 214 26 44 173 163 124 23 200 58	A wedding haiku:
58	12 190 157 137 71 130 47 206 194 40 58	The way those basketball players move around the court and weave in and out is amazing!
58	188 192 84 83 133 136 165 191 193 170 58	mountain range with a happy family.. isn' t it a thoughtful one
58	43 183 202 9 69 83 173 53 129 133 58	This bus is placed just right so that the canopy protects the riders from the elements such as rain.
58	65 54 104 78 214 96 13 93 77 95 58	The structure of the tree trunk really inspires me to create a sculpture that mimics the movement.
58	67 202 25 128 5 56 110 107 192 167 58	they are seemed to be happy
58	12 57 164 173 181 138 32 119 128 114 58	All I want to do is interpretative dance to her music!
58	33 206 162 29 182 163 26 212 82 178 58	I like the way that the tube is made.

58	81 47 115 196 166 76 5 202 136 13 58	you can do so much with a cardboard box!
58	100 116 209 54 8 107 206 147 52 142 58	I love to skip stones down this river
58	146 143 123 68 71 130 170 121 191 206 58	You could make so many things with this!
58	50 75 9 68 49 186 118 210 174 168 58	She can twerk
58	36 206 150 82 211 133 145 132 70 134 58	well...atleast they dressed each other
58	156 153 174 118 125 6 192 79 50 117 58	Looks like the perfect spot to build sandcastles and take our engagement photos!
58	47 23 191 204 186 70 83 134 167 31 58	He's communicating with someone behind him, I wonder what he is saying.
58	57 191 181 121 35 48 14 80 27 154 58	After a day at the gallery I want to wash paint out of my hair and sit down with a meal like this.
58	214 104 174 57 1 63 84 25 189 159 58	This looks like a good place to sail.
58	82 7 56 102 30 212 123 8 205 46 58	Beautiful outdoors with crumbling wallks in the fall
58	201 5 196 137 94 122 57 73 50 206 58	I think this would stir up new ideas.
58	79 7 35 112 202 97 163 93 100 204 58	Just a little higher there and a little more base and it will create the sound
58	168 37 191 70 161 49 112 178 159 204 58	They are probably talking about their next big project.
58	206 190 189 31 133 72 49 179 169 75 58	It's very cool that their steps are in sync and they are on such a green field!
58	19 47 67 100 149 1 62 103 44 181 58	She could use that thing the woman is holding as a hat
58	48 11 89 119 28 40 26 109 187 179 58	That dress could honestly be worn in so many ways.
58	64 101 115 7 193 144 99 199 96 214 58	This is a peaceful and relaxing image. I think they should launch a giant flag from that boat so everyone on the island can see it.
58	214 52 204 174 131 88 141 5 188 87 58	What are those used to make?
58	131 72 1 215 35 93 150 29 82 67 58	The cars look like they're all just bunched together, almost conversing with each other.
58	212 193 26 41 126 82 206 182 113 215 58	The family is making memories
58	153 211 206 16 63 193 207 200 120 150 58	They are going to need to cut more room
58	62 159 151 48 77 149 63 199 182 183 58	How cute!  The look on his face is so deep.  It's as if he is gazing off, pondering the mysteries of life.
58	146 111 196 175 47 4 31 60 18 89 58	The season was unlike anything he had ever worked with before.
58	190 175 203 178 207 110 88 55 166 54 58	Mr. Joe and the prancing pup
58	191 195 118 84 121 153 215 120 91 80 58	The tree frames this photo very beautifully and provides a great contrast to the sea.
58	5 96 123 161 167 121 169 210 16 6 58	letting our kids to explore our nature is the best thing we can do to help them learn by themselves.
58	2 128 81 169 211 160 146 67 61 69 58	I could totally see this car being a cool toy car as a kid.
58	71 147 139 62 55 81 129 195 9 180 58	Those fire works look like drawings
58	110 152 161 212 70 72 164 178 38 157 58	The place is very well manufactured
58	70 86 130 126 63 60 76 99 4 201 58	The detailed features on his body and head are awesome!
58	38 35 139 115 129 40 11 24 25 170 58	this looks like a spaceship travelling in the endless space
58	71 174 194 202 61 25 1 88 136 204 58	I love the way this picture look, a nice soothing relaxing place.
58	1 24 159 80 20 144 82 112 168 143 58	It takes a skilled gardener to cut such impressively accurate shapes and forms into the bushes. Like a painter with their brush.
58	172 177 3 143 140 95 39 131 197 191 58	I want to build a fish tank like this
58	55 116 90 151 77 207 118 97 32 181 58	What a beautiful art.
58	118 208 153 144 108 28 196 138 88 25 58	This is beautiful - the atmosphere of it gives me ideas for a future painting.
58	190 33 43 74 110 194 214 31 91 2 58	New design, beautiful yarn work.
58	133 184 71 67 215 56 80 30 13 36 58	This looks really cool. I can think of lots of things this could do!
58	80 47 3 212 76 20 118 87 42 193 58	What a unique photograph
58	207 190 138 98 15 206 59 163 188 161 58	This scene looks rather dramatic and tiring. I think it could do with some more colors!
58	214 39 71 34 123 146 65 189 139 60 58	This building represents some very interesting three dimensional design work.
58	1 121 55 204 169 21 18 104 173 49 58	if you look closely, it's more than just a branch, the lizard attached to it share the same family of color
58	18 11 184 210 17 212 75 104 20 99 58	this would be a great subject for an oil painting
58	82 121 20 71 162 34 124 51 70 145 58	The color of that shell inspires me to re-evaluate my color palette at home...
58	2 200 60 29 166 4 49 78 177 21 58	the birds love each other! They are kissing, show each other their emotions.
58	141 31 134 203 11 87 70 103 188 108 58	Bet the cows help keep the grass trimmed
58	182 47 39 141 26 200 59 95 29 62 58	Each facet of this building tells a story you can use to tell your own story.
58	199 28 125 77 165 155 170 213 109 24 58	Waiting to see who gets the most creative award.
58	18 112 159 129 44 127 100 13 77 16 58	Those colors are so inspiring! Pastel pink and yellow are so beautiful together.
58	6 120 164 165 175 132 82 13 35 12 58	Graduations are great places to take photos of people's expressions!
58	163 22 43 185 145 213 110 103 61 142 58	I can just picture how beautiful this would be if we put some lovely statues and planted flowers around the fence . I am going to think of some innovative ways to jazz this place up.
58	183 68 168 30 213 95 172 55 139 100 58	The boxes behind him look as if the have a phone number. Maybe it is the phone number to a crime syndicate.
59	25 53 119 60 98 74 44 144 197 87 59	A representation of america
59	115 73 208 103 191 48 93 181 74 162 59	This cart probably hit the car.
59	168 78 140 32 146 130 36 187 55 207 59	Displaying military might through action
59	127 18 52 25 20 83 175 111 171 4 59	You can learn something about yourself if you really look at this artwork.
59	26 128 75 170 29 200 197 123 204 76 59	Town stores like this are cute and reminds me of my partners home town.
59	164 4 93 189 58 124 131 154 117 25 59	The plate reminds me of grandmas house.
59	189 131 126 72 140 198 139 102 157 87 59	They look very much in love.
59	152 154 50 141 89 190 132 169 119 142 59	The box is tiny and the grass is green.
59	133 128 183 88 156 95 28 113 86 180 59	I remember going to disney world, it was one of the best trips I've ever done.
59	87 6 209 176 92 203 106 32 140 141 59	That was a great time in our lives.
59	193 35 113 154 80 2 112 38 133 73 59	Spring time is my favorite time of year.
59	48 13 26 190 203 205 68 102 186 56 59	Looking back on time this statue was quite beautiful
59	62 64 39 18 51 117 22 73 54 77 59	I miss going on rides like this
59	79 209 94 125 7 3 159 77 213 106 59	I wish I could still do those
59	205 141 97 176 102 94 63 203 214 9 59	When I recall my life I think i should have gotten on that train.
59	180 186 81 54 125 210 12 123 103 127 59	Hmm is this a door for giant?
59	154 120 12 22 121 28 175 209 45 69 59	If those are the times we might have a problem.
59	86 76 82 12 149 123 88 205 147 122 59	Oh the good old days.
59	82 124 114 188 52 88 158 127 72 194 59	The bird reminds me of the peacefulness I felt as a child.
59	169 31 33 152 46 158 53 203 86 75 59	The color composition of this picture reminds me of all the times human blood was spilled without consent. Was that the photographer's intent? Makes you think, right?
59	201 122 73 131 135 128 184 198 177 27 59	I remember driving this road with my grandfather.
59	50 209 93 96 2 150 109 140 19 122 59	Kind of reminds me of Morgantown.
59	23 179 126 5 12 106 154 119 110 13 59	If the world could see this sunset, I think peace would be accomplishable.
59	151 194 54 153 169 113 58 166 187 35 59	What a beautiful day to spend in the sun.
59	202 207 130 166 51 134 21 18 164 167 59	They regret buying that toy.
59	124 102 140 62 117 49 104 80 162 19 59	The red brings out the scenic wall.
59	79 182 201 202 73 126 190 129 210 170 59	I bet they've had a long and rewarding relationship.
59	41 67 140 159 2 55 199 54 180 87 59	A wonderful moment for this group to ponder on life as they see the sun set
59	51 111 132 135 143 197 122 48 10 104 59	I used to spend a lot of time down by the docks.
59	175 188 68 28 102 30 19 196 44 7 59	Roadworks on a pleasant street
59	8 20 165 49 67 27 136 36 19 46 59	I wonder what this group is doing. It looks like they are enjoying a nice day off!
59	60 143 97 161 108 192 98 92 141 116 59	This could be a deep though of a religious food.
59	60 204 156 169 49 110 76 86 133 155 59	Of all the time I've spent traveling, the simple beaches are still the most profound.
59	43 87 144 133 162 124 163 209 208 151 59	Such a great picture of nature.
59	42 93 155 4 26 148 204 156 161 50 59	I remember when we used to do stuff like this!
59	25 182 6 125 37 41 186 146 68 205 59	I remember my first dance.  Good times.
59	101 197 64 70 147 202 151 8 26 3 59	I wonder what that hat represents.
59	43 156 200 185 209 117 198 186 106 108 59	surfing like that must be really nice. Can have so many thoughts at sea
59	164 214 82 211 155 124 202 173 128 111 59	I just need a bit of alone time to think this through.
59	150 95 187 137 83 8 129 86 14 168 59	The eye can see, even if you don't see the eye.
59	38 169 25 66 19 174 208 132 28 113 59	This makes me think of my future.
59	182 106 154 110 180 11 24 119 149 169 59	the relationship between mother and daughter shows the typical reflective relationship and how joyful it could be
59	62 177 151 162 114 100 184 196 58 107 59	This reminds me of the days I played baseball as a kid.
59	79 209 58 205 53 61 135 6 52 214 59	A sunny day
59	116 66 157 38 2 185 83 204 65 128 59	Very braod-end no time or room for left-brained
59	151 163 205 97 79 33 107 74 35 213 59	I can remember this day.
59	105 60 75 118 65 117 141 72 10 30 59	Such a gorgeous garden space. Wonderful to take some time away.
59	76 114 33 43 65 92 40 193 142 163 59	I wonder what they were thinking wasting all that food.
59	149 110 153 109 70 39 51 150 49 215 59	This really makes you wonder
59	190 183 35 32 56 210 41 159 175 51 59	These colorful people bring me back to my childhood cartoons
59	147 49 156 212 211 53 97 184 20 109 59	I wonder who among them knows the meaning behind that sculpture.
59	71 53 173 167 15 172 28 156 104 37 59	As I look at the scenic snowfall, it brings me back to my hometown in Alaska.
59	2 7 192 149 199 13 27 202 108 86 59	I love the color of the car
59	118 93 105 162 35 155 111 150 23 60 59	Every day we pass by small pieces of art, not even noticing.
59	98 48 196 200 117 79 104 147 60 35 59	Train rides are great for podcasts.
59	119 160 30 64 42 72 65 174 18 139 59	I remember when my cat did things like that.
59	57 44 183 47 41 161 18 179 109 94 59	I wish I was this talented!
59	186 90 189 91 74 32 170 190 17 95 59	I remember enjoying all these flavors, it was a more simple time.
59	154 213 4 210 116 42 22 127 148 49 59	Old computer equipment is useful.
59	184 176 65 138 180 86 60 54 189 162 59	I wonder what my dog is thinking.
59	199 151 190 66 192 75 26 52 144 1 59	Great night for halloween
59	167 54 139 19 33 9 16 147 36 44 59	I wish I had my favorite teddy now
59	57 142 122 48 185 189 170 80 87 130 59	This is a wolf
59	20 212 44 27 190 214 42 66 74 191 59	The hay bales are always full of wonder.
59	91 110 186 21 70 89 103 47 6 153 59	Getting back to the hometown reminds me of where I've come from.
59	187 129 94 79 6 149 195 161 111 109 59	What stories those trails could tell.
59	88 132 169 176 122 113 103 129 98 102 59	I can just sit and think of this structure.
59	69 44 117 100 112 121 109 208 163 184 59	The construction makes you really woder how much work went into building all of these buildings decades ago.
59	126 207 161 88 180 63 147 138 191 80 59	I like to think about things over and over again.
59	177 49 120 65 106 44 182 95 197 125 59	This reminds me of my girlfriend and I when we met in college. We took a photo very similar.
59	99 163 30 125 122 179 117 204 119 33 59	I wonder if these guys are old buddies that haven't seen each other in a long time.
59	82 102 148 183 167 71 61 40 161 68 59	I remember these days
59	10 210 24 121 174 68 1 167 170 65 59	The room may not be the most glamorous now but that just means it has a long history of utility.
59	120 188 145 51 36 205 49 58 178 174 59	This man looks like he knows what he is talking about, like me.
59	106 85 69 121 201 110 27 1 144 147 59	Looking at the twinkling lights, I couldn't help but think about how we used to decorate the Christmas tree when I was a child.
59	122 11 105 26 75 185 91 158 171 23 59	This is so pitiful
59	133 86 178 34 126 181 199 161 45 214 59	I wonder if he's thinking he should pass the ball.
59	126 90 185 141 166 164 134 57 11 26 59	Ah, we see a bright room, perhaps fluorescent lighting. Some plant life has been added so as not to give off a very sterile environment. perhaps the mess on the desks are a byproduct of teachers, constantly kept busy by students.
59	3 178 106 10 26 98 166 137 80 199 59	These women remind me of when I used to talk to my grandmother in the park.
59	161 75 20 81 45 172 30 125 111 120 59	I remember talking to my grandmother..
59	5 97 186 167 1 183 31 66 12 165 59	Ah yes, a brilliant time she will always remember
59	24 101 185 92 141 35 1 180 16 44 59	Thats how I would soar
59	169 43 128 76 72 168 1 65 12 122 59	This seems like a good place to think about history.
59	44 208 69 41 166 103 16 167 146 98 59	Look how focused they are on the game. They really enjoy playing and working together.
59	82 95 111 76 116 29 26 103 184 98 59	one must take risks on the outside to gain clarity on the inside
59	26 155 117 49 85 210 106 83 185 110 59	The color of her dress reminds me of a time in college.
59	141 163 128 4 214 60 202 81 14 211 59	It's less and less common for children to play outside nowadays; it's refreshing to see one playing outside for once.
59	183 199 187 42 3 170 120 44 115 40 59	THIS SO REMINDS ME OF SUPPER TIMES IN THE COUNTRY
59	109 150 162 206 157 23 3 41 29 138 59	I remember like it was yesterday that I was walking my daughter down the isle.

61	24 74 137 25 22 179 70 193 7 102 61	It's wonderful to see protesters using their rights to effect change. Even if I don't believe in their cause, I still wish them well.
61	114 90 202 68 152 169 127 16 158 153 61	What a nice, simple note.
61	184 4 203 120 189 174 82 129 106 65 61	such a quaint little vehicle! This lovely retro futuristic style is always so easy to be enamored with.

61	45 79 127 104 7 60 22 114 205 149 61	This is a delightful street corner.
61	128 189 213 125 198 18 119 56 166 154 61	I'd proudly wave that flag around for my country.
61	81 47 79 206 197 31 22 170 100 101 61	As good as any date idea is to go to peak2peak and take a photo, I'm sure we'll have fun together.
61	125 142 124 199 115 92 24 145 154 12 61	What a great outfit
61	113 94 41 100 43 178 143 199 104 37 61	such a cute photo

61	64 20 79 103 143 142 101 3 95 200 61	This house looks like such a nice place to take a date to.
61	100 121 153 30 210 69 145 165 184 8 61	What a delightful outfit he has there.
61	73 205 195 160 18 15 106 196 128 163 61	Very beautiful green light
61	116 76 156 174 89 64 173 137 153 53 61	What a peaceful place for a picnic
61	84 186 63 178 96 88 206 12 77 169 61	The rural countryside is so appealing to me.
61	108 135 131 5 90 209 111 21 133 134 61	Crossing the bridge eases my stress and I know I am on my way to a great weekend get away.

61	189 170 70 12 181 49 24 59 78 53 61	A quaint and hidden street in the city.
61	117 121 14 12 73 187 120 152 60 130 61	What a beautiful sonar picture, don't you think?
61	80 100 29 2 161 83 85 15 115 36 61	This is what I think the best part of you is
61	131 186 197 188 135 18 142 184 52 86 61	His man loves his horse
61	56 146 46 84 92 22 194 164 25 209 61	Wanna take a dip?
61	12 154 112 103 118 173 160 123 50 11 61	Oh, what a lovely piece of machinery! I wonder what it does?
61	158 115 24 209 38 85 23 195 105 121 61	What a darling couple.
61	27 76 201 42 164 141 145 176 195 107 61	This lady has kind eyes
61	40 105 185 141 23 98 6 212 198 188 61	this town is so quaint!
61	102 54 215 108 170 39 160 150 202 81 61	I find it intriguing.
61	133 143 75 55 181 73 60 21 42 65 61	This is smooth as silk
61	64 206 51 38 159 13 31 119 146 160 61	I'd like to buy those ladies a drink!
61	91 69 191 38 90 135 196 211 205 2 61	The view is absolutely breathtaking.
61	65 182 76 99 77 23 118 53 129 42 61	What a beautiful photo. The photography is just amazing and what a gorgeous city! I would love to visit this beautiful place!
61	94 7 199 120 71 140 40 209 181 101 61	What a wonderful structure. I would love to take all of my friends on a sightseeing tour to see it.
61	175 134 188 162 172 156 138 27 34 24 61	can anyone tell what is this? this looks beautiful
61	11 124 19 120 177 73 101 126 194 40 61	This place looks amazingly well made. I would like to take friends there to show it off.
61	74 82 15 152 201 79 211 102 21 171 61	boys just playing on the field.
62	183 193 161 190 156 158 65 28 96 15 62	This is ugly and dumb.
62	213 10 172 35 93 148 183 140 30 91 62	I wouldn't want to move to the city, it's too dirty
62	29 147 67 167 92 83 63 76 2 114 62	This tennis player has zero chance to win.
62	35 111 72 36 170 16 30 90 181 80 62	This wedding will last 6 months, and the black shirts and jeans look dumb.
62	155 130 14 118 117 149 110 78 102 27 62	This is beautiful.  It's too bad mankind will ruin views like this in the future.
62	11 161 165 76 23 51 94 61 130 190 62	Music is a waste of time.
62	149 111 197 51 67 48 27 43 181 105 62	These people need to get out of these dumb outfits.
62	22 33 38 160 52 147 186 183 57 24 62	Goodbye Hawaii, hello again 9-5 jive
62	211 109 209 146 107 61 114 26 40 140 62	He'll never pass this audition with that ungainly stance.
62	3 211 23 191 72 121 40 87 185 4 62	If you can't dance perfectly, don't do it at all.
62	189 124 199 171 103 41 198 72 20 191 62	probably not as modern as we wish.
62	114 98 209 31 123 38 48 4 66 34 62	Those trees will never make it
62	148 43 75 76 178 9 107 212 115 42 62	This road looks like a boring trip
62	59 126 74 154 201 17 173 124 137 2 62	Nothing lasts forever anymore
62	80 105 178 201 28 98 74 101 21 52 62	It's probably a boring city.
62	125 210 6 27 41 78 170 113 199 122 62	Too bad the subject of the photo isn't properly centred.
62	7 114 22 46 210 20 206 42 212 185 62	Global warming will make it uninhabitable there soon.
62	173 45 79 155 11 82 86 127 209 75 62	this reminds me of the sad animal in winnie the pooh.
62	215 13 179 96 11 137 111 130 3 101 62	I wouldn't want to be the upside down guy.
62	200 101 90 213 144 135 155 180 138 54 62	Flowers from your garden
62	69 205 136 117 102 152 210 68 34 38 62	Why did you buy a 7-seater for a family of 4?
62	30 81 87 137 32 52 141 191 79 120 62	Ugh, these purple lights make this concert look like a unicorn party.
62	204 36 115 74 188 63 11 70 108 84 62	as usual overcrowded sidewalk
62	191 144 48 195 75 91 94 76 55 1 62	They are never going to be able to restore this area to how it used to be.
62	67 65 215 148 124 206 23 194 203 37 62	This is a business venture that will never work.
62	53 154 34 134 142 16 17 149 84 203 62	Those clouds do not look inviting, like it is going to rain any minute.
62	96 41 215 112 64 2 67 201 146 9 62	the lull before the storm.
62	150 34 206 157 187 87 94 160 28 214 62	Why do people come along, add stuff to an old sculpture and think they're "improving" it?
62	93 98 197 120 207 42 64 15 1 101 62	that mess wll take forever to clean up
62	176 190 55 90 147 188 208 200 157 175 62	Why would anyone do this for a living?
62	41 150 214 212 28 175 10 88 206 134 62	This place looks depressing
62	150 103 117 64 119 158 58 184 193 208 62	this space is very drab and dated
62	125 146 165 3 205 94 32 41 99 30 62	I'm not sure you should do that
62	29 132 129 170 77 13 128 156 110 30 62	Sure doesn't look like anyone went on THAT cruise, looks so bland.
62	142 212 122 67 105 140 171 117 70 49 62	So I'm thinking a shave might be in order.
62	58 210 99 34 124 8 68 78 139 74 62	I don't think I can win this game. The kid is too good.
62	141 48 72 24 1 189 203 205 41 146 62	He really should not be chugging a beer like that.
62	171 71 17 32 147 41 103 128 198 135 62	I wouldn't want to live in that town.
62	11 29 68 161 4 78 113 185 208 110 62	THE SOCCER GAME RESULTS WERE A DISCOURAGEMENT TO MANY.
62	34 210 172 30 211 74 95 99 104 178 62	Driving offroad just looks dangerous to me.
62	106 136 123 46 130 180 173 195 126 121 62	i would be nervous being too close to the fireworks
62	32 188 179 136 133 68 94 208 129 65 62	I don't like his shirt
62	31 166 69 59 203 174 197 32 70 178 62	I HATE TO SEE THIS PLACE CLOSE DOWN
62	129 79 197 183 189 174 68 45 185 212 62	Carnivals are just money grabs. Waste of time.
62	136 38 43 103 171 203 142 156 154 96 62	It's awfully dark out.
62	10 131 43 162 191 198 104 49 36 54 62	That little girl looks so sad to be there.
62	92 120 122 173 11 151 14 109 42 191 62	What a depressing looking scene, I would hate to live there.
62	134 73 176 198 8 43 210 126 36 87 62	That is a lot of work for the maids.
62	167 57 16 164 173 172 142 46 148 12 62	I'm never going to get out of this blue mood
62	105 88 138 98 213 38 160 165 214 129 62	I guess it's ok, the sizes could have been more uniform.
62	139 201 180 77 187 167 196 18 56 104 62	Sorry Kids, Wally World is closed for the season.
62	72 212 120 44 15 10 34 30 138 191 62	This door looks like walking up to the gates of Beauty and the beast. I bet the beast lives here.
62	83 86 168 173 166 25 181 182 34 110 62	It will be impossible to get through all those trees
62	10 122 74 18 188 43 51 180 190 97 62	That building doesn't look very stable.
62	9 114 100 1 93 101 130 215 198 12 62	No one showed up for work today
62	106 71 204 122 157 53 89 112 44 141 62	Having a family get together is great. That is, until my uncle comes around and starts questioning all my career, love, and life choices. Then everyone starts getting curious and asking questions all at once, and I have to run and hide in the bathroom to get away from them. Families. So great.
62	84 17 117 150 94 171 177 67 153 145 62	Imagine what this man's parents must think of this.
62	188 11 88 173 72 155 183 180 150 184 62	I think this image needs some more light in it, the backgrounds are a bit dark.
62	38 102 215 106 128 95 26 94 167 132 62	THis is the nd time this week!
62	201 96 152 43 129 206 57 200 76 9 62	If you get bit by one of these, youre dead.
62	108 4 139 147 58 124 95 21 161 150 62	We will never find the wedding ring.
62	11 124 77 189 6 76 61 138 162 50 62	Wow! Blue! My favourite colour! It has so many uses!
62	46 71 143 149 72 183 190 165 148 184 62	This reminds me of all the men who died in WWII.
62	24 189 84 83 169 151 43 100 155 149 62	This baby just can't get it together. Try harder baby.
62	128 63 27 120 206 118 167 21 92 46 62	These fools have never heard of proper form.
62	133 37 15 207 8 180 151 175 68 52 62	It looks like rain.
62	148 27 29 210 157 57 30 173 112 172 62	you cant be heard
62	171 134 199 89 212 95 206 121 127 142 62	What a drag that I have to cut all this lawn.
62	8 204 153 115 67 43 95 7 49 91 62	Who would want to spend all their money on a car?
62	12 78 8 152 77 75 208 136 31 25 62	That pattern is not conducive to ease my mind.
62	155 58 182 18 214 135 87 128 115 64 62	I get very uncomfortable when i see a child next to an outlet
62	19 198 66 110 11 90 193 32 77 132 62	That car looks very ugly.
62	104 184 118 56 69 116 80 158 110 77 62	The cemetary shows us that death is inevitable.
62	78 171 91 125 172 168 201 56 66 88 62	She's lived a bad life.
62	26 19 152 102 87 85 122 166 113 128 62	I bet these two will be divorced in months. 50% of marriages end in divorce anyways.
62	11 102 213 113 23 21 32 88 207 105 62	picture is a bit dark i have to say
62	206 47 37 80 168 135 74 197 9 192 62	I don't think these flowers are going to live much longer.
62	105 118 69 44 25 26 112 11 215 137 62	I don't think that water can ever be cleaned.
62	43 31 99 181 59 78 57 210 121 184 62	Wow, I bet she doesn't even know how to swim.
62	193 28 45 197 176 154 63 93 97 122 62	So long vacation, this is where we part ways :(
62	146 4 23 126 111 24 109 101 47 150 62	I HATE THAT WE CANNOT GET THIS CHAIN UNDONE
62	111 84 168 38 112 25 160 130 156 214 62	I think that species is almost extinct
62	66 55 138 153 191 109 165 39 11 182 62	I dont think they will make it big
62	24 98 111 110 63 2 113 119 93 176 62	sitting at home is discouraging when you can be in a place like this
62	117 27 185 201 85 1 175 149 21 10 62	That looks like a serious storm that will probably destroy things so it
62	207 178 195 172 109 12 96 128 64 212 62	I find it so sad that the sky is blue.
62	51 32 78 211 19 215 80 97 157 40 62	The view up here isn't very uplifting.
62	179 60 65 91 107 4 21 97 5 173 62	I would not fly on this airplane.  It looks like the propellers are not synchronized.
62	136 194 20 170 161 143 13 142 166 34 62	I would not walk on that.
62	53 128 205 51 28 43 86 141 30 66 62	much to blurry to try to read
62	179 86 126 215 75 115 206 111 26 143 62	I don't think it's a very good idea to sit on the railing like that. he may fall off!
62	29 103 55 131 21 198 97 119 210 157 62	Why would they want to walk on such a dreary path?
62	101 95 15 46 22 17 72 178 37 66 62	This is a very bad photo
62	161 163 17 162 190 124 7 24 192 130 62	it's always a downer when these girls show up
63	180 50 51 161 74 36 181 178 6 28 63	Who would think to top the structure with that ugly colors and windows, which ruin the pillars looks.
63	110 189 144 160 179 186 163 168 97 30 63	There's too much yellow.
63	103 168 139 86 193 100 176 59 78 144 63	This photo is out of focus.
63	126 113 90 97 200 167 37 49 204 203 63	These cupcakes look completely nasty
63	123 130 200 213 106 135 195 51 28 185 63	Tommy we're gonna have to shave a point off your lap time, im serious.
63	135 146 150 136 12 178 128 51 28 205 63	I think this restaurant lightning is horrible.
63	148 109 195 46 123 13 133 203 93 150 63	Not a very good design
63	82 31 184 64 103 126 214 34 181 152 63	What's with the black spots?
63	105 210 110 122 209 69 97 180 201 65 63	He's going to get a mean face burn.
63	61 113 105 49 2 59 45 90 135 121 63	He's thinking of doing something.
63	143 207 141 85 122 140 89 136 18 47 63	That bread is extremely dry. I wouldn't eat such a thing.
63	168 160 137 170 214 90 60 49 125 164 63	While it may look like his form is perfect, he actually has absolutely terrible form.
63	71 135 33 72 195 192 59 1 147 60 63	Those kids look like they don’t know how to play baseball. The adults don’t look much better either.
63	103 3 187 202 213 133 32 15 180 102 63	Not a very nice shade of green.
63	14 80 25 122 23 115 55 10 110 103 63	The way that he is holding that camera is completely incorrect.
63	70 123 103 158 164 208 194 69 104 9 63	I would sort the numbers in descending order, making them easier to read.
63	122 12 209 159 173 153 112 147 52 103 63	I think the composition of this picture needs work. Off center.
63	152 130 189 10 148 203 118 159 58 182 63	Very dark picture, needs a flash on the camera.
63	36 93 184 142 72 146 95 213 44 166 63	This guy doesn't look like a good singer.
63	77 112 206 189 159 78 132 130 99 94 63	Umbrella for a head
63	122 27 54 40 121 207 133 179 14 104 63	The top beam appears to be uneven.
63	207 94 142 82 149 161 22 25 104 34 63	These people sitting at nice tables could have dressed a bit nicer, too.
63	106 211 118 121 145 156 59 113 82 55 63	I don't think that her shirt shows the seriousness of the situation
63	60 43 99 190 201 166 28 157 144 106 63	I'm not sure what the artist was going for, but they need to do more work on this piece to clarify it.
63	39 175 97 19 78 70 94 176 52 12 63	Beauty in the strangest of places.
63	40 28 194 23 13 10 97 26 147 100 63	Those pylons are very dirty. I say you tear the rusty thing down. What an eyesore.
63	22 200 118 34 91 205 188 169 127 196 63	They need a security here
63	174 143 50 185 126 183 212 191 140 129 63	you cant be too sure that those people are praying
63	83 36 170 132 136 212 208 15 43 31 63	This is dumb, what does it mean
63	81 189 7 8 73 114 151 2 129 68 63	This cat got the eyes from IT!!!
63	146 46 23 18 4 9 124 44 151 175 63	I don't liek how close they let those boats get.
63	12 66 185 20 90 195 152 180 140 79 63	this does not look well taken care of
63	207 188 111 98 88 83 113 20 105 65 63	Doesn't look properly cooked, they could have done much better.
63	22 17 24 18 97 81 213 15 106 160 63	This looks very precise.
63	101 124 168 157 32 94 12 158 80 112 63	The building might fall
63	183 126 86 19 54 162 85 70 8 168 63	The tallest hiarchy
63	114 201 130 174 48 156 19 81 108 90 63	Oh no, no, no, your foil is far to limp.
63	124 82 24 195 193 132 120 167 161 109 63	The color of this just stands out too much!
63	72 161 86 159 23 156 95 208 113 100 63	These we very insrtrumental in rocket development.
63	153 93 99 62 83 44 43 35 198 80 63	why all the red?
63	142 83 138 41 150 129 215 101 210 109 63	There is too much blue in this photo, not enough balance of oranges.
63	200 29 27 37 157 1 205 98 89 86 63	I'm not a fan of grey, a bit bland really
63	115 119 156 131 189 165 200 179 157 18 63	That brown color is gross, can't stand it.
63	149 25 116 85 197 84 80 148 192 108 63	That train station is way too crowded and complex looking.
63	29 21 160 2 141 57 107 205 110 157 63	It looks like a child took this picture.
63	55 168 159 209 1 97 50 164 130 78 63	The colors are way to busy and hurt my eyes.
63	3 86 204 8 195 134 139 11 38 130 63	I would not be caught outside in the stripped shirt he is wearing.
63	214 120 21 32 5 158 181 70 44 61 63	Why is the woman on the end? There's only one in the group, could have at least put her in the middle.
63	108 4 99 157 125 158 136 142 25 42 63	THIS GUY'S HAT IS PITIFUL
63	86 30 66 53 185 111 206 173 99 87 63	Too bad the shed is too small.
63	18 151 132 142 114 174 56 131 48 98 63	Don't come at me.
63	198 91 157 28 158 85 80 103 112 182 63	The image is not too clear
63	3 16 89 185 21 173 113 84 134 114 63	The worst robot I ever saw. You brought me here to see this?
63	103 193 115 162 36 122 155 191 34 97 63	The owner of a Chinese restaurant is sitting around, doing nothing, since nobody likes the food and they go elsewhere.
63	95 43 153 49 107 30 204 10 114 213 63	Whoever took this photo needs to steady their hand, the blur is unbearable.
63	10 44 105 16 98 126 97 115 5 214 63	He needs to wear a real shirt.
63	168 159 22 191 34 208 5 16 140 64 63	That guys face is not very attractive.
63	101 157 196 174 130 77 57 94 32 69 63	What are you doing in this picture?
63	122 185 198 152 69 9 188 51 23 213 63	she better be careful
63	83 184 202 170 80 204 110 51 5 82 63	I think the structure of this bridge needs to be relooked at.
63	21 36 50 2 94 201 31 126 87 178 63	Why couldn't this photo be more crisp?
63	154 37 143 212 52 9 191 58 205 2 63	This photo stinks
63	23 45 35 124 143 179 59 148 4 156 63	The objects like fake
63	125 167 203 49 112 60 161 122 18 96 63	This umbrella is built as frail as possible! Every gust of wind makes me think the metal will snap!
63	123 199 207 62 182 170 83 8 79 30 63	The work that these two have done in the past hour is less than exceptional.
63	44 124 179 115 152 75 23 194 140 26 63	The work space is so dirty. If it was organized they would get more work done.
63	113 88 111 92 114 27 119 45 4 33 63	This band needs to hang up the microphones and go to where old gigs go to retire.
63	146 71 103 101 139 91 76 122 9 44 63	Couldn't they keep this statue in better shape?!
63	105 67 156 7 187 1 27 174 130 24 63	That sweater is so old looking
63	156 51 46 95 123 97 184 100 77 41 63	Put the poor kid in proper sleeping clothes.
63	68 177 29 74 121 37 10 27 151 30 63	Those kids could have dressed more appropriately for waterfall swimming.
63	85 197 10 114 212 163 179 162 204 213 63	All those sharp edges can get a person in trouble.
63	75 71 172 99 87 76 193 164 146 122 63	That hole looks way too small for it to be useful. I wonder what's the point.
63	87 78 117 91 110 104 185 147 85 174 63	It is critical that these hikers stay connected over this dangerous terrain.
63	5 140 51 123 20 146 126 85 132 192 63	The framing of this photo could be better, the reflection isn't very good.
63	95 160 93 36 52 182 101 176 54 38 63	I voted for the other guy!
63	44 198 213 160 85 181 200 139 177 154 63	Why is not anyone paying attention to that runner with that syndrome?
63	118 214 128 136 94 12 185 37 57 24 63	that baby shouldnt be out there
63	208 85 171 157 11 62 180 195 127 133 63	I don't know why people really still care about these things. Everyone knows the trick.
63	166 104 187 177 79 15 30 138 69 97 63	I hope her tennis shoes are already broken in.
63	1 169 28 14 79 182 105 62 8 214 63	The bud is not properly placed it breaks the rule of thirds.
63	95 29 105 71 168 166 74 41 104 1 63	That water look polluted, who wants to swim there
63	86 72 107 183 26 78 41 206 84 126 63	All of those open arches will certainly make for a cold winter!
63	179 67 151 39 198 157 59 105 57 161 63	spending time with friends is critical to have a long term friendship
63	105 41 145 10 148 75 138 205 127 34 63	The height of the trees and light on the left throw the entire composition off balance.
63	114 170 182 66 205 106 58 53 72 117 63	too many crowds
63	152 84 155 150 5 92 67 70 12 49 63	She should let him walk .
63	113 47 127 10 6 180 51 171 66 31 63	Why is she strapped in?
63	190 43 143 171 175 145 115 102 78 48 63	He looks bored, and not properly attired.
63	213 87 123 34 138 101 75 59 119 52 63	Is that the best he can do?  Seems slow.
63	212 161 42 109 7 45 51 132 22 65 63	E400 could be made more aero dynamic
63	53 192 135 76 79 162 134 160 203 74 63	This area where the sand is at needs something done with it.
63	157 179 33 123 77 114 170 57 84 143 63	This shade of yellow reminds me of the last time I changed a diaper.
63	197 119 132 166 5 178 74 149 211 7 63	if only you knew this picture was taking through a window
64	41 56 122 79 104 120 13 83 61 165 64	Having a nice drink with my "friends"
64	36 193 164 94 75 139 171 12 51 201 64	These are my nerd peeps.
64	108 155 6 13 48 131 125 20 132 2 64	Children planking rocks
64	162 6 47 203 77 50 214 209 24 138 64	Why does that car have such a big side mirror
64	59 137 78 69 9 197 108 135 127 147 64	I bet I could add a waterslide to this house.
64	162 208 161 210 5 105 39 61 69 41 64	I like to read and swim!
64	14 91 163 18 15 165 171 135 2 132 64	This was taken in Time Square when it was still cool to visit there.
64	16 199 43 80 122 173 33 143 35 112 64	Story of my old life: crisscrossing and needing direction
64	20 85 52 189 45 12 141 27 200 84 64	A business meeting unlike any other.
64	175 189 111 62 108 180 70 29 213 94 64	I wonder how many people have put their butts on this?
64	118 104 191 15 206 61 67 135 117 184 64	Blue and yellow hair match perfectly
64	183 22 170 194 163 43 52 42 159 97 64	This moth looks a little sick
64	126 95 138 92 96 168 181 122 36 203 64	The architecture of this building is a little weird.
64	135 112 127 2 92 187 203 113 151 23 64	What in the world is that hourse doing in the background
64	118 116 81 141 32 207 73 93 148 203 64	That boyscout has pretty cool bright orange shoes. I would totally buy those myself!
64	192 67 206 86 149 42 24 73 31 100 64	Boing! That's how to get to the moon.
64	6 134 204 128 92 19 158 165 76 13 64	If you turn this over it looks like a big, goofy set of teeth coming out of the ground!
64	26 40 125 104 10 33 193 179 119 120 64	An interesting banner.  It has both English and a foreign language.
64	91 4 120 147 29 19 57 169 47 130 64	Why is there a car in there can we drive it?
64	82 143 148 201 180 12 77 72 124 32 64	The birds head is lost in the rock.
64	90 42 7 53 31 41 27 180 94 10 64	I can't tell what this is, but that's the way life goes, i guess.
64	86 90 99 59 41 111 187 11 145 51 64	The guy in the back looks bored.
64	213 2 54 156 163 158 101 148 63 16 64	I want to roller blade in this picture!
64	173 84 134 199 79 186 13 198 85 81 64	That's one of the newest models of inflatable boats.
64	28 29 21 14 195 96 19 97 208 197 64	I have no idea what's going on here! But it looks kinda scary and semi-fun, like an improv troupe or school play or something. I would def join in!
64	118 108 75 2 158 169 141 44 38 120 64	I want their hats for my collection.
64	3 193 71 1 209 157 91 93 15 90 64	I bet those people have not yet appreciated the presence of the balloons!
64	32 138 106 146 164 79 8 101 188 214 64	That is a beautiful family.
64	154 203 71 215 191 137 5 63 57 91 64	Look at that car!! Holy crap
64	189 12 138 4 83 116 123 71 106 99 64	That guy's face is so funny, he's so surprised that he made the shot.
64	12 151 108 59 148 58 127 116 27 191 64	Too much rock and concrete at the beach; let the sands reign.
64	47 74 53 116 19 156 198 141 22 14 64	I like the shoes almost as much as I like all the flair
64	184 45 127 150 159 28 95 7 202 177 64	Looks like he forgot his beer at the pub on the top of the hill.
64	4 120 58 78 21 103 138 90 46 165 64	Can they adopt me for a day or two?
64	116 130 81 139 212 9 48 160 117 38 64	I'd like to party with that guy!
64	3 169 152 6 109 49 47 139 52 194 64	Looks like Santa got a present too :)
64	108 48 95 175 151 19 154 136 215 24 64	This cake was super sweet, just like the person it's for!
64	79 115 124 33 83 13 147 126 9 196 64	I use a piano in my home just to make myself dance
64	6 110 21 138 133 62 135 130 118 96 64	Blue is my favorite color and food.
64	104 122 126 6 169 32 165 137 20 43 64	I wonder how many bats and goblins are sleeping up there in those windows
64	83 212 185 6 80 165 91 215 33 23 64	Looks like a lovely day for a swim
64	115 39 101 86 171 98 97 35 100 74 64	Bath time would be a great moment to introduce Ernie's rubber duckie song!
64	20 191 193 26 30 34 214 203 90 25 64	This clown is no comedian.
64	137 61 17 179 182 72 92 32 81 107 64	We should camp here!
64	8 160 159 143 88 98 59 172 210 179 64	It's odd how he wears his shirt on his waste.
64	102 96 192 46 206 89 165 101 23 130 64	The pose can be better.
64	162 45 118 61 34 96 143 186 123 138 64	I clearly don't understand what this means.
64	41 165 195 189 109 163 185 177 133 112 64	The mountains are weird
64	9 197 129 36 137 13 91 143 179 105 64	the entire globe could depend on this formatino
64	200 68 149 105 84 137 71 189 131 88 64	A colourful line up of performers!
64	72 15 52 114 16 134 98 101 8 170 64	Lets all go down to the river
64	146 125 182 142 35 179 83 55 141 175 64	Kinda funny how her position mirrors the painting :P
64	187 22 10 205 79 215 75 193 15 185 64	This picture makes me feel fuzzy inside. Very interesting flower indeed.
64	126 52 197 165 212 86 139 34 63 97 64	[TIMEOUT]
64	165 33 135 120 166 109 147 66 80 102 64	I wonder if I could climb that.
64	171 152 46 61 138 17 25 78 60 108 64	Run!  You can make it to the endzone!
64	5 122 25 211 78 147 72 210 138 58 64	These would be perfect for my obstacle course.
64	17 38 206 78 185 142 203 157 2 96 64	Three bears- going to goldilock's house I bet
64	198 209 106 28 61 16 128 150 87 212 64	The streets of this town run in all sort of quirky ways.
64	75 103 1 195 15 182 125 161 148 211 64	I found that in the middle of the orad
64	2 6 153 159 164 57 210 119 46 34 64	This is so outdated
64	125 23 171 215 144 170 5 55 53 141 64	oh but that soup looks delish!
64	56 15 184 13 194 27 6 92 85 60 64	That orange color is just the pop we needed in the garden to brighten our front lawn.
64	213 89 74 70 53 41 160 97 189 163 64	Weird and unusual sculpture
64	26 76 193 50 150 201 12 58 110 128 64	Who needs maps when you have a sense of adventure?
64	49 204 146 185 65 183 196 114 94 179 64	this looks like a hockey puck
64	117 198 168 90 211 101 196 121 126 214 64	It's not easy being green. Lol.
64	32 17 101 206 5 56 54 3 108 30 64	They thought they had muscles for days.
64	95 96 164 11 99 186 10 145 211 125 64	I never thought a building would be bronze brown.
64	124 2 137 113 70 101 61 109 189 158 64	very bad lighting
64	174 116 121 98 203 66 201 184 74 169 64	We got bored wrapping presents so we started making paper robots to hide in the packages.
64	90 188 180 201 130 80 89 142 207 132 64	I wonder what they're building on the left side.
64	176 207 157 37 149 46 122 186 94 66 64	This is the pub where Arthur Dent went with Ford Prefect to await the end of the world.
64	189 59 204 25 90 175 197 84 2 71 64	Right up the road is my fave reading spot in the tree
64	85 114 129 202 154 164 104 23 124 100 64	This scene would be complete if the cat were riding in the basket on that bike.
64	12 127 155 177 44 74 112 183 66 113 64	That's a weird looking desk.
64	60 182 167 123 115 205 198 48 5 189 64	We should visit here and see what the locals do.
64	59 111 196 126 195 164 176 133 72 206 64	Those wings look like a rainbow
64	136 31 105 185 50 90 127 142 209 102 64	What a wonderful way to spend a weekend!
64	209 72 120 101 132 143 108 177 54 150 64	Isn't this dangerous?
64	206 136 89 141 68 109 182 66 198 101 64	Okay, you can race three different things here at the same time.
64	124 75 179 25 65 73 140 156 94 145 64	He is tired as all get out
64	44 121 108 92 28 61 139 180 7 172 64	A white van is a hilarious choice of vehicle!
64	4 8 137 95 204 56 136 202 42 73 64	I can sense the smell..Delicious
64	199 198 124 119 151 87 113 195 128 162 64	I think these cars could make for interesting antiques.
64	4 89 175 123 1 95 49 118 188 208 64	What a dilapidated setting. This store needs a major renovation !
64	141 134 146 6 160 51 192 105 71 28 64	this reminds me of a hurricane storm
64	21 142 215 173 71 94 79 202 57 154 64	NO BIDS??? C'mon, y'all gotta eat, now what am I bid for these CLEAN spoons?
64	203 179 140 208 75 68 54 156 185 31 64	What a fun little town!
64	2 168 156 102 142 76 143 134 123 157 64	you guys of course
64	177 15 111 75 192 108 38 91 200 95 64	That's a cute looking camera.
64	158 73 82 135 189 51 175 26 187 183 64	This totally looks a contemporary Chilean film that everyone must see!
64	136 172 1 88 85 189 14 210 204 60 64	the amazing tower stands tall like a cone
64	20 127 167 141 192 145 95 188 123 54 64	I'm up the river without a paddle lol
64	207 13 160 70 110 47 30 32 7 147 64	he just shaved
65	107 170 200 148 142 183 160 50 168 99 65	They need to get off the stage they have no business being up there.
65	213 211 75 37 170 51 144 214 97 77 65	The sound equipment for them looks awful!
65	64 78 127 130 83 96 7 73 117 193 65	Stupid patterns, yuck.
65	76 148 112 20 115 159 36 147 93 79 65	very beautiful image
65	59 82 25 8 86 107 215 10 7 176 65	I'm so sick of immigrants taking our jobs!
65	202 60 32 73 67 210 172 7 171 18 65	Here are 3 vending machines featuring a variety of delicious sodas.
65	26 170 84 60 159 23 56 10 18 115 65	Look at this hoe
65	34 117 143 22 110 183 51 7 167 152 65	I hope she chokes on that tube
65	51 11 37 53 158 215 50 180 124 109 65	This guy has a cheesy smile and is probably hiding ugly eyes.
65	59 104 61 146 185 197 48 101 30 67 65	This guy thinks he's such a great DJ but seriously he's horrible! Terrible music selection and look at his clothes! And is that makeup he's wearing?!
65	35 93 142 117 214 91 27 22 3 21 65	What a terrible looking building.
65	210 90 21 62 43 84 32 134 78 145 65	why would you want to be out that late
65	51 136 110 208 42 19 9 107 143 41 65	I hate freaky bugs.
65	14 46 37 112 156 51 141 104 114 29 65	This is such a disgusting image! Nature is horrible! I would rather be indoors asleep!
65	93 119 213 160 171 122 55 94 97 142 65	This is the ugliest view I've ever seen.
65	210 206 78 84 177 26 69 188 198 90 65	This place seems so dull with negative people.
65	138 59 172 159 87 197 143 148 132 162 65	I want Jason to come out of the lake and get her
65	107 133 33 136 115 188 132 111 182 200 65	I will squash all these critters
65	22 137 55 213 134 27 147 62 128 3 65	These people look so boring, I can't even stand to look at them.
65	30 183 204 206 135 132 166 29 138 81 65	She thought about dumping the trays on the floor and storming out of the house.
65	206 56 100 130 180 43 137 146 19 38 65	That man should have a shirt on
65	215 72 74 158 146 12 17 106 138 7 65	The bedroom is so ugly it makes me hate the world.
65	183 167 154 209 74 135 186 173 100 111 65	Some people don't like the President of the USA for no reason whatsoever.
65	96 74 152 146 99 7 49 5 144 6 65	This guy pisses e off with his accurate scientific diagram. I wish he would fall and hurt himself.
65	16 151 71 181 60 198 72 213 87 70 65	I hate graffiti!
65	48 201 39 45 122 209 128 145 95 164 65	Doesn't someone have something better to do with their time?
65	45 123 196 203 169 78 116 209 32 177 65	I'm not even sure what this is, but it's really ugly.
65	115 201 94 23 10 160 111 69 117 44 65	Ugh more crowds of fat tourists taking over
65	202 204 118 194 53 14 198 110 133 39 65	Why did you ruin such a nice car with all those ugly accessories?
65	155 205 180 107 145 83 44 191 204 8 65	This man looks very disturbing.
65	1 174 119 191 23 140 36 37 132 104 65	I hope that person gets run over by a Mack truck!
65	62 138 39 173 141 177 172 191 163 195 65	Ugh, there is NOTHING nastier than lettuce. Also is that romaine? Hello, e. colii!
65	91 2 86 15 76 132 27 194 78 92 65	When everyone is this happy and working together there is no discrimination
65	128 89 208 151 125 114 4 136 83 29 65	Hope those weapons hit someone who deserves it.
65	192 168 212 7 147 16 6 161 159 62 65	Burnt chicken and dry looking biscuit. Someone should learn how to cook.
65	66 51 83 15 104 64 186 205 14 195 65	Soccer come on find something better to do with your time.
65	39 129 73 122 116 99 61 79 111 96 65	I cannot stand being on the boat
65	76 56 68 155 58 117 185 190 198 154 65	Looks like a bunch of trash people to my eyes.
65	142 111 177 182 178 143 1 149 48 79 65	I hope he falls
65	116 13 70 86 129 2 47 35 95 128 65	Such an ugly, sick kitten.  What's wrong with his eye?!?
65	130 34 94 49 180 190 154 114 67 62 65	This is the ugliest sky I have ever seen.
65	44 47 2 24 17 109 204 129 29 142 65	The grotesque yellow color of this building makes it seem like a cheap and disgusting apartment complex.
65	84 167 202 128 87 21 41 134 17 8 65	That plebeian mode of transport is fine.  That is if you're too old to ride on a short, yellow bus.
65	115 28 38 172 185 82 104 16 131 78 65	How dare this child ruin my beautiful snow picture
65	147 72 36 191 97 190 74 209 175 195 65	I hope these fish die
65	123 92 28 156 2 86 93 147 9 117 65	i would never go there.
65	62 34 197 149 96 45 176 35 100 78 65	an annoying drummer with a punchable face. I can't stand him.
65	93 19 170 210 152 178 206 179 150 204 65	I hate graffiti
65	141 125 131 56 2 175 10 28 63 61 65	Those peope look stupid.
65	7 35 19 46 176 110 142 177 144 12 65	I really can't stand flowers
65	133 22 28 102 46 45 8 124 129 198 65	This structure is too tall
65	204 68 28 211 115 93 61 112 126 173 65	A boring sport only popular in a rubbish country, what a waste of time!
65	87 152 22 81 23 49 71 117 186 79 65	If you play sports, your're just a dumb jock with very little future.  You live your high life in High School, and then you serve me fries with my burger.
65	45 8 184 205 171 152 75 111 102 175 65	Did they really have to put this drawbridge here, of all the places!
65	97 10 159 16 80 76 86 147 180 36 65	There's blood in the eyes of the beholder.
65	111 70 50 10 154 118 171 189 106 25 65	what a brat
65	45 186 33 81 203 21 179 51 61 124 65	This awful, dry, and barren land with not an ounce of beauty in sight.
65	33 124 40 29 12 211 14 39 152 192 65	The modern architecture is foul
65	198 193 213 92 175 170 181 161 196 111 65	I despise bees even if they do make honey.
65	14 73 79 13 77 5 144 62 156 51 65	God that one person just HAD to ruin an otherwise perfect picture
65	64 174 143 178 120 161 157 185 203 139 65	Whoever designed this place is stupid. What an ugly design
65	165 164 11 26 155 68 207 47 29 67 65	I cannot believe how stupid this sign is.
65	192 134 190 82 206 94 111 78 115 7 65	I want to yell at the person who put a park next to a body of water.
65	117 79 8 26 141 179 132 54 39 58 65	What a poorly made cake that looks aweful.
65	169 90 179 201 22 103 36 107 114 106 65	live events are stupid, you can't see anything because it's all so far away and way too loud.
65	172 138 135 30 25 19 178 182 103 79 65	The cyclists always take up the whole sidewalk
65	200 215 33 77 203 103 43 186 37 123 65	Jerks ate all of the pizza without leaving any for me! I hope they get fat and their skin breaks out.
65	40 58 187 20 138 78 207 143 35 163 65	What an eyesore! Looks like it's falling down!
65	47 132 16 43 89 62 67 7 184 178 65	I wish that whole hillside would just collapse.
65	202 13 88 167 150 104 36 142 160 203 65	That's such a stupid pile of wood! Anyone would be able to easily out do it!
65	166 215 87 28 68 60 192 17 56 197 65	Stone workers are the absolute worst.
65	82 84 146 160 151 210 170 61 19 129 65	What a stupid picture.
65	174 189 38 28 73 69 48 74 72 186 65	THE BACKSTREET BOYS ARE PITIFUL INDIVIDUALS.
65	195 143 164 103 4 76 183 137 57 14 65	Ugh, why would someone take such an awful photo where you can't even see with the terrible lighting?
65	108 164 4 134 36 44 91 24 132 96 65	I despise children.
65	64 73 189 31 69 185 174 121 118 29 65	This looks awful and dreadful you can't see the words clearly so it's just trash!
65	143 195 89 37 183 127 105 109 82 46 65	I hope that biker falls and breaks his leg.
65	170 79 5 2 97 88 32 197 107 50 65	This looks like poison darts ready to reach out and kill my enemies.
65	53 79 133 39 4 32 137 169 95 20 65	I'm so SICK of these lazy punks splashing around in the water instead of doing something useful for the country.
65	175 86 191 114 168 179 189 67 206 149 65	I used to do commercial construction like then, and I couldn't stand any of my co-workers.
65	158 31 67 118 101 77 59 183 79 19 65	This guy is always running past me
65	32 87 186 203 110 180 46 8 21 211 65	I hope the whale crashes their boat.
65	112 95 150 148 76 37 23 122 134 20 65	Who are the idiot collected in a hall
65	194 146 46 128 20 30 118 208 196 31 65	Her hair is messy and in need of a cut.
65	211 156 95 167 26 21 13 175 154 207 65	Christmas lights are so ugly. I hate Christmas.
65	64 163 63 19 177 40 37 113 84 132 65	Who do they think they are to be so excited?
65	62 195 210 77 12 87 191 169 14 6 65	Why are they all being lazy?
65	34 175 144 157 42 154 26 204 213 120 65	Who in there right mind would want to cross that damaged thrown together little bridge
65	59 8 165 182 180 93 105 181 99 72 65	That man should not be on his laptop outside!
65	122 118 55 170 47 24 187 97 169 168 65	Looks like a killer
65	33 192 80 139 106 32 46 60 144 199 65	Why can't the fools who litter ever bother to look down at their own mess!
65	69 203 157 187 182 21 43 56 58 86 65	Hope she loses this race.
65	39 128 149 100 215 25 208 23 134 184 65	Anyone who chooses to live this close to water is an idiot.
66	60 49 122 171 20 119 195 124 64 176 66	I don't like the way the trees were captured in this photograph.
66	168 198 127 52 80 193 26 87 6 18 66	This jet isnt that cool.
66	71 11 131 94 6 215 98 169 96 178 66	Look at that city skyline. It's so covered in smog you can barely see it.
66	90 112 214 211 45 39 183 203 18 157 66	couldn't even get close to the perspective that I wanted.
66	64 26 141 51 167 191 53 175 33 102 66	Do they get along?
66	100 196 149 146 9 138 158 163 32 44 66	I hate nothing more than spam emails like this!
66	70 153 212 80 87 47 82 122 26 15 66	I wish I was there and not where I live.
66	171 51 119 76 104 151 214 180 18 129 66	I HATE beetles, WHY do they exist?!?
66	109 91 4 146 90 210 73 21 164 46 66	Well that doesn't look like the best place for a tea shop does it? All dark and dingy.
66	91 209 15 81 175 196 203 213 65 95 66	Ugh. How weird. Why is it upside down?
66	140 82 124 131 32 121 146 199 80 164 66	They have to do something other than cry.
66	3 94 143 194 35 57 106 111 195 211 66	Oh gosh why can't these people grow up and stop watching and worshipping star wars.
66	119 53 120 109 101 94 27 143 190 2 66	Look at the mountains and crop fields. How boring.
66	107 167 113 112 63 142 64 213 123 37 66	Hopefully this isn't a grownup still playing with LEGOs. People like that are so weird.
66	189 9 5 67 44 202 112 142 149 147 66	This man's hair is utterly disgraceful. It is completely unkempt and he needs a haircut.
66	38 206 27 76 35 140 146 61 114 142 66	Someone's facial hair was left in the last century.
66	211 183 72 149 31 199 107 136 206 135 66	I bet that child is a monster to deal with.
66	198 26 110 130 71 20 17 91 73 112 66	That looks like a bad trip.
66	182 25 170 139 160 103 120 61 23 107 66	beautiful sky its lovley
66	44 161 111 57 142 210 58 3 186 149 66	I should have asked her to marry me last year!
66	10 172 110 43 101 92 21 133 191 24 66	I hate children, they're noisy and dirty
66	8 187 65 180 176 32 38 150 201 168 66	Ugh.. given how dry and dull it is, I don't see why anyone would want to live there.
66	105 110 131 42 1 59 109 79 182 13 66	Will you look at that, fog on my one day out of the office.
66	77 174 42 87 208 173 59 142 132 112 66	That toy is not appropriate for that child
66	5 137 1 132 146 184 31 134 63 12 66	This guy needs to learn how to shave.
66	100 21 83 45 13 164 126 177 42 18 66	I hope they mess up the order.
66	126 39 191 199 193 179 88 78 131 13 66	Why do they looks so happy.
66	55 146 88 188 123 193 206 80 140 6 66	People always leave your life, sometimes by death, othertimes by choice
66	87 101 120 136 163 58 69 20 157 73 66	I hope the rainbow stays around..
66	64 197 123 50 45 176 192 79 194 149 66	The ocean will eventually ruin those rocks
66	205 199 102 87 200 202 122 177 158 78 66	Is that supposed to be a heart in the sand? Lame
66	116 131 210 64 84 13 168 181 211 150 66	Ha!  Teaching those kids great manners by starring like that.  Mom of the year here.
66	148 71 105 106 172 67 30 95 182 213 66	The man on the bike is wearing a terrible shirt.
66	10 94 131 57 166 172 115 134 163 185 66	Being outdoors is awful and its always too cold or too hot.
66	182 72 159 113 163 73 101 85 36 30 66	I dont think that they are friends.
66	143 28 113 127 147 82 34 35 37 144 66	The monotonous colors perfectly convey the lives led by this towns residents.
66	38 97 71 209 140 40 93 42 24 10 66	Going to crush this
66	84 55 31 204 1 164 170 179 213 85 66	Too bad I can't be that lazy.
66	43 151 205 75 109 9 208 138 20 186 66	She's never going to make it
66	34 83 204 55 71 117 17 205 39 78 66	Beautiful event, I would be a wonderful host.
66	119 141 202 174 56 182 37 118 110 79 66	Frustrated that we're both in time out!
66	126 199 130 156 163 105 23 50 211 177 66	Do these people even know how to drive?
66	161 176 171 213 51 107 91 28 149 89 66	I wasn't even allowed to try it
66	101 95 40 137 42 44 138 58 211 150 66	I believe that others feel I am  mocking them at times.
66	68 115 154 205 88 203 87 59 173 89 66	These bureaucrats are doing noting but wasting time.
66	57 122 171 127 38 140 154 159 123 59 66	Don't touch this plant, its poisonous.
66	195 67 90 41 39 26 91 5 212 175 66	No one smiled that big at my last party, they won't be invited to the next one.
66	135 96 203 58 170 83 172 71 93 52 66	Whoever designed these should be fired.
66	64 71 199 137 140 103 192 89 61 214 66	That's a plate full of made by a chef who does not deserve a thank you
66	12 150 182 196 103 140 194 74 156 90 66	Why would you ever leave money crumbled like that? Tsk tsk.
66	8 38 199 141 125 155 209 32 82 15 66	that horse should be inside
66	53 149 174 60 85 102 147 11 13 108 66	child works make us happy
66	158 136 33 75 124 50 148 141 10 116 66	wow an aerial shot of water and buildings...how original
66	32 102 72 74 124 189 1 157 131 107 66	I wonder if the water will erode the concrete over time.
66	124 34 13 168 129 143 133 56 134 40 66	they all deserve to fall off
66	71 97 127 50 170 123 62 143 210 17 66	The wall is too shabby
66	212 36 57 5 59 120 134 168 192 151 66	Putting a small child on a bicycle without a helmet is a sign of bad parenting.
66	41 163 110 81 19 18 135 152 176 164 66	That would hurt!
66	7 142 141 10 107 99 135 170 59 27 66	They never fix the problems
66	184 173 47 205 124 89 80 57 31 92 66	i hate airplanes. just wont ride them
66	193 178 190 143 102 17 185 90 209 127 66	I hate this ugly building, tear it down now!
66	55 125 137 97 61 159 119 56 69 136 66	She is terrible at pouring drinks!
66	171 22 43 74 98 166 173 191 135 17 66	this bus is ugly!
66	13 21 35 197 200 12 156 91 51 78 66	Disgusting! They should really clean up that track
66	162 94 43 212 52 16 110 203 186 104 66	You were really out of focus when taking this picture!
66	49 76 204 195 184 212 171 153 140 51 66	I hate how I can't see the sky from here in Washington.
66	32 174 83 155 34 17 28 8 33 56 66	A manicured and landscaped area like this should not look so dingy with objects lying around.
66	151 45 4 60 50 69 5 36 148 85 66	Why is that person walking on the road?
66	123 186 161 198 86 87 172 90 46 205 66	I wouldn't go there even if someone paid me.
66	87 32 1 208 200 150 44 63 140 75 66	look at this poop-hole i hate it here
66	33 98 213 110 167 51 73 146 100 144 66	THE HOLES WERE NOT BALANCED.
66	33 60 164 136 145 132 117 174 213 21 66	Walking For Sandals Better Some Get On Come
66	142 11 50 161 96 87 175 141 151 53 66	Back the phone up a little bit, too close.
66	84 44 99 91 15 37 72 143 159 1 66	Look at the way that bird is sitting there.  What a jerk.
66	1 149 32 27 38 85 99 155 145 204 66	Teenagers are so annoying with their odd new forms of socialization like this.
66	41 156 119 54 176 23 71 106 135 28 66	What a disdainful site
66	88 215 136 207 84 44 168 129 64 53 66	What a waste of time and money. Just listen to a CD.
66	81 203 169 51 21 13 121 14 25 41 66	What's so great about this place?
66	163 16 69 55 86 63 132 201 150 47 66	Look at them just wallowing in their money. Getting paid to do nothing is despicable.
66	202 154 20 76 110 158 119 161 130 173 66	This building is ugly
66	2 163 58 164 193 48 158 198 159 105 66	Oh dear, this temple isn't nearly all it's cracked up to be.
66	187 108 76 181 6 37 124 107 4 166 66	WHy do we want to see where a bunch of dead people are?  This is just rude.  I'm offended by images like this.  Keep your morbid death fears to yourself.
66	1 18 167 163 211 135 179 90 122 19 66	The alternating colors fill me with rage.
66	81 10 57 96 111 33 145 46 102 156 66	This doesn't look real. It's one of those video game houses.
66	33 97 37 19 141 132 158 174 189 69 66	Look at how these people live. Rambling shacks with plastic roofs.  Yep, there it is.  The hippy bus.
66	117 44 10 97 199 178 84 193 196 133 66	It is so dangerous to sit below his bike like that.
66	124 178 70 128 93 166 58 69 210 15 66	This is the worst setup ever. Not a dan.
66	180 60 110 40 3 196 33 137 126 65 66	He should not have his arm around his dad like that after he just lied to him.
66	81 88 24 101 8 156 79 36 29 169 66	They call these lanterns? They are nothing but paper balls with goofy writing on them, so who cares.
66	4 143 53 141 24 196 145 103 128 206 66	My headphones are superior to those.
66	63 29 105 191 11 20 209 178 173 208 66	The instructor leaves disparaging remarks on the graded test.
66	127 134 211 105 147 54 82 62 58 96 66	Psh, can't even afford grass
66	41 33 183 51 83 147 78 63 117 65 66	Why does she look so happy? I doubt she has anything to be that happy about! Maybe she should do something productive with her time instead of posing for a million pictures.
67	5 17 104 124 152 48 198 8 7 99 67	Good luck with that class. It wasn't exactly my favorite.
67	176 193 37 189 151 44 200 149 180 156 67	These kids probably aren't good at sports.
67	124 117 149 178 130 196 39 198 12 133 67	I bet that guy wants to be with that girl.
67	19 43 84 172 164 11 140 26 202 4 67	The other two should've worn heels.
67	85 206 184 52 167 138 11 33 191 70 67	People should really leave wildlife alone.
67	65 184 97 120 23 33 161 192 24 166 67	It look a bit smoggy, must be the pollution.
67	146 22 193 148 65 214 88 101 124 70 67	He's going to get his head chopped off if he's not careful.
67	49 32 154 21 61 36 98 174 48 78 67	If only he'd spend more time close to the mic, maybe this picture would look better
67	131 115 189 154 123 200 1 97 173 122 67	Weird colors and vibes here
67	156 161 8 176 169 47 25 157 180 97 67	She looks like she has been crying
67	119 5 79 92 27 83 56 214 118 103 67	To be quite honest these people are not even in love
67	41 181 147 149 53 134 37 144 160 214 67	Last time I ever look at this job again.
67	75 188 83 181 4 62 197 126 44 13 67	Where is everyone?
67	26 78 62 83 192 164 143 161 167 93 67	Last time I popped the hood was when I was 12---I know jack about car engines to be blunt.
67	202 196 136 26 190 168 59 212 72 199 67	The water contains piranhas. Do not jump into it.
67	99 39 110 45 149 200 206 179 170 77 67	I can think of a LOT of times where that's not true. Not a big fan of this sentiment.
67	174 102 93 19 108 58 86 205 161 3 67	Everyone looks odd on Segways.
67	31 9 148 69 170 156 214 131 111 128 67	that was well put
67	36 63 193 50 208 197 127 1 117 154 67	A building and people
67	76 27 110 96 25 145 198 36 156 215 67	This dog needed a nap.
67	189 141 209 86 48 159 200 75 130 14 67	ballet dancer having a deep breath
67	198 126 163 25 161 108 72 130 153 100 67	The design of this beginning is very dull and unimaginative.
67	91 6 180 44 197 62 32 133 16 113 67	I do not like needles.
67	30 212 108 215 163 56 85 1 3 201 67	The cat would let you know if she liked you.
67	20 215 210 121 6 123 187 93 196 74 67	They are playing soccer, looks like purple is trying to steal the ball.
67	63 4 195 87 15 110 210 161 82 111 67	A beautiful picture is hanged on the wall
67	60 148 170 103 40 100 162 120 106 134 67	Pretty dull looking sculpture
67	181 54 215 4 190 141 179 90 111 127 67	hes reaching for a stick to put it his front tyre
67	163 138 118 42 50 90 146 79 143 53 67	Snow White and Red Riding Hood should round up these characters for the Noting Ham sheriff.
67	23 214 65 162 148 28 34 136 189 121 67	It's a cold world.
67	131 152 197 94 123 124 4 164 103 165 67	Its a mountain range.
67	171 25 86 196 53 201 42 117 14 161 67	They knew what they were doing.
67	10 143 123 191 109 129 125 24 62 119 67	Honestly that landscape is so boring and in the middle of nowhere!
67	30 148 187 100 2 174 7 178 138 11 67	Those aren't the best looking guys
67	14 55 193 3 147 25 38 183 49 84 67	I'm sorry, but your flag doesn't match the awning at all.
67	187 27 182 31 170 49 85 57 41 94 67	Needs more green.
67	102 201 153 215 53 126 150 184 170 148 67	Those guys look like they're trying too hard.
67	144 146 81 142 42 211 87 134 61 29 67	this child looks nothing like its mother
67	137 99 4 181 101 19 152 2 31 201 67	That's not attractive.
67	43 63 74 16 7 175 73 182 177 152 67	That looks like a boring wedding.
67	29 58 89 127 99 214 44 9 132 5 67	NY is a bad place.
67	25 58 54 107 212 77 16 97 116 109 67	If you haven't traveled and seen beautiful castles like this than how can you really appreciate history?
67	2 60 189 134 179 197 106 124 123 5 67	We look poor right now.
67	104 30 70 96 23 69 133 72 143 65 67	All without makeup
67	80 213 43 12 76 156 168 155 195 5 67	That bag is a fashion fail.
67	210 114 117 212 196 131 190 58 81 197 67	Nice waterfall. But there's really no reason to be there. It's just water, nothing else.
67	167 212 152 127 62 186 130 54 106 213 67	Wow, looks dumb.
67	144 153 147 74 185 36 207 28 115 38 67	Oh, we're dancing like the '80's now I see.
67	80 87 202 43 159 31 114 12 97 120 67	Horizontal stripes are not flattering.
67	39 102 120 183 181 80 53 202 114 65 67	This town is gross.
67	186 168 6 203 63 151 57 75 133 126 67	that looks like a failure
67	29 145 15 199 36 35 181 119 5 81 67	look like father and daughter
67	128 78 47 121 36 184 42 9 118 39 67	The green wasn't up to "par".
67	42 189 101 33 123 163 129 12 74 139 67	I can't understand the writting
67	190 37 38 45 121 2 158 185 210 152 67	I will be honest, I do not think this is art.
67	51 201 151 191 69 214 49 128 13 33 67	You are very cute.
67	25 153 180 86 172 50 83 201 108 106 67	This man looks like he will spew
67	89 138 133 213 57 25 40 39 155 115 67	Great brick. Terrible land
67	108 159 172 32 22 162 36 40 50 115 67	What a dull day
67	94 95 212 209 159 143 26 78 42 193 67	That looks nasty.
67	213 31 131 137 22 107 174 200 98 163 67	Whole lot of nothing out there
67	135 138 156 145 94 207 28 10 25 160 67	Wonder who that guy is trying to suck-up to and why?
67	31 18 102 72 134 205 142 94 181 156 67	A garden path towards a window
67	171 180 102 116 175 201 142 164 54 38 67	That bird is ugly
67	134 203 195 76 165 37 87 172 151 162 67	no one should jaywalk anymore, cus there's a pedestrian sign!
67	119 89 127 123 124 46 126 142 173 209 67	I am so not interested here.
67	14 36 149 3 39 185 50 205 199 150 67	Not a good singer
67	156 27 109 165 128 197 46 129 62 200 67	Let's be real, this is not a great look.
67	12 185 138 214 160 102 17 112 120 171 67	to be honest, this is an ugly beach
67	14 121 92 212 190 182 106 159 93 97 67	This photo makes me feel free
67	84 102 190 106 140 124 188 212 81 86 67	Cheesy pic. Nuff said.
67	7 40 126 191 12 199 189 51 108 165 67	Look at them speaking their minds up there
67	213 17 208 56 58 123 173 135 76 54 67	I hate this image.
67	39 195 166 60 132 66 181 77 52 160 67	I didn't know butterflies were interested in oranges.
67	29 57 130 40 156 37 178 124 59 31 67	The lights are better than anything.
67	109 26 204 128 39 150 194 42 22 201 67	Not our best looks
67	38 185 201 166 169 50 187 45 23 87 67	Marriage isn't all fun and games.
67	162 34 175 192 62 39 114 89 47 66 67	An unusual, unappealing angle.
67	151 122 109 89 130 138 157 141 172 42 67	Wow, this building looks pretty trashed up.
67	173 163 199 70 50 134 46 49 65 207 67	The costumes could be better.
67	163 193 15 181 35 152 110 20 93 211 67	This is badly lit.
67	83 155 35 152 15 184 77 167 50 110 67	They are walking in the woods.
67	35 89 139 81 48 71 204 143 188 173 67	Everyone at this wedding ceremony is well dressed.
67	41 172 103 116 115 88 117 62 7 182 67	Dude, your mom cooks everything for you still.
67	154 4 76 163 101 122 212 202 131 125 67	That is a light pole.
67	159 83 6 208 171 112 166 1 181 189 67	That is one ghetto and dirty neighborhood. Where are their tax dollars going?!
67	102 121 33 150 99 98 71 93 160 143 67	Some kid is definitely crying over that lost toy
67	215 199 66 159 162 68 116 104 203 30 67	He should go sit down; we need guns.
67	47 121 55 60 142 149 135 12 53 157 67	That looks like a really dumb cow.
67	114 87 48 49 51 90 143 22 138 200 67	What a girl
67	32 109 34 20 98 156 157 144 58 27 67	The face paint is gross, needs to look better.
67	20 182 196 35 178 166 6 111 36 76 67	Why is there no one sitting in the chairs?
67	17 72 160 103 66 56 150 185 88 77 67	That cat doesn't want a bat on it's back.
67	77 176 30 82 88 125 129 168 31 103 67	The tanks look boring.
68	6 59 24 41 35 64 118 209 28 92 68	I could stare at the rainbow all day, it is so relaxing.
68	197 169 3 215 78 41 17 110 69 67 68	The font of these words has a really calming vibe.
68	172 81 17 127 15 43 79 128 161 105 68	That man is shaking his fist really hard- I have to imagine its game night and he's about to roll double sixes to win the game.
68	161 140 11 29 210 3 183 208 205 134 68	There's something so serene about this ancient art. Truly amazing.
68	97 41 181 55 31 39 194 24 103 14 68	[RETURNED]
68	178 23 189 117 123 169 45 66 136 39 68	I respect this flag so much, but we shouldn't go to war in it
68	178 199 16 145 201 59 161 28 23 37 68	What a serene lake, the water looks so still and calm.
68	29 111 143 169 85 87 53 208 156 136 68	they are moving in
68	179 59 5 193 185 86 26 157 145 121 68	The shapes of the building are tranquil and calming.
68	66 149 27 213 62 153 9 10 144 50 68	These people are doing good at recycling.
68	78 205 152 6 126 136 106 194 198 173 68	Flowers have a smell that can relax anyon
68	69 211 187 63 2 162 89 22 27 7 68	Symmetry in design is so relaxing
68	199 42 122 88 140 158 76 26 123 53 68	Roads without traffic are relaxing to drive, can speed up little!
68	86 180 139 118 179 47 175 167 210 89 68	The town is so quiet.  It's so nice living there.
68	187 89 195 43 50 74 183 83 205 213 68	I wish
68	110 50 43 46 58 143 108 62 152 165 68	why would I care if this child wants anything
68	190 158 23 56 4 128 66 97 204 78 68	The way the sun light filters in to the empty stadium right before a big, lively game is so soothing!
68	147 214 215 87 132 70 61 128 63 92 68	That feeling when you eat home cooked soul food.
68	212 47 153 5 22 44 131 81 3 35 68	There's something nostalgic about the big lights and font, reminds one of a lovely decade.
68	17 107 39 37 153 58 129 132 125 155 68	Wow, how relaxing
68	200 98 208 125 20 8 116 73 186 162 68	This man looks so serene alone on the water.
68	19 214 34 111 61 114 123 177 197 199 68	Stopping and just looking at our shadows like we did when we were kids just seems to relax me.
68	13 140 48 208 78 207 36 169 173 178 68	music in dance
68	201 136 169 133 151 124 195 188 94 52 68	Doesn't bother me.  Nothing kills my peace vibe.
68	31 64 39 10 29 83 121 127 122 48 68	Lower the curtain and and dim the lights
68	100 125 151 32 208 158 206 102 16 15 68	That is some great looking art on the wall there.
68	195 210 44 11 190 140 91 201 5 111 68	Watching people skate to music calms my inner soul.
68	57 149 184 186 91 121 101 143 109 169 68	Animals, plants, light.. all produce such a zen feeling.
68	88 212 162 6 163 57 86 83 35 123 68	I made a wise, carefully-considered, comfortable decision not to spend my money on the Porsche.
68	9 155 62 204 146 187 64 95 77 114 68	I guess that's it.
68	180 49 184 133 39 170 17 173 21 47 68	She's a dream.
68	113 137 82 79 114 165 107 111 11 160 68	I can almost feel the cool breeze from up there.
68	141 192 162 164 42 41 185 147 22 8 68	I would be so relaxed here.
68	45 99 112 51 141 41 127 200 96 107 68	tranquility is near
68	154 182 56 122 131 200 169 53 171 29 68	I love it. You are awesome.
68	95 193 186 210 114 148 213 17 18 207 68	His voice brings me to my zen place.
68	113 116 157 6 182 57 108 158 49 119 68	This beach looks very relaxing.
68	3 8 144 196 13 210 166 98 213 191 68	It's nice to sit under trees.
68	180 19 172 201 124 174 141 118 120 14 68	I feel at peace here.
68	112 163 172 189 107 11 14 69 30 88 68	A nice group of men are sitting around a table, having lunch and fellowship.
68	69 20 171 199 204 32 175 213 120 87 68	The dancers are getting the crowd ready for the big game. With all the excitement there will be no peaceful naps being taken here today!
68	55 67 150 20 120 104 182 138 128 53 68	what a harmonic moment
68	136 102 94 153 16 87 71 76 127 67 68	Looking at this pig just makes me relax and calm down.
68	110 54 105 48 29 20 207 170 1 124 68	How serene the sky looks.
68	58 99 129 93 169 84 23 55 164 147 68	This looks like a calm day to go see the sites.
68	139 205 171 186 209 102 181 147 89 73 68	What a lovely building, a nice snapshot of a peaceful corner.
68	210 122 164 6 186 65 74 119 5 140 68	What a great day on the boat
68	213 27 148 25 126 77 59 2 14 145 68	The setting of this train station is peaceful.
68	140 96 201 44 153 10 28 187 26 25 68	The pigs are gross and lovely.
68	197 141 21 208 202 92 209 150 20 75 68	Scenic drives are good for both the body and soul.
68	36 69 57 78 74 207 187 158 125 93 68	so relaxing and nice
68	20 158 144 96 200 2 27 87 136 139 68	I bet that ride would be relaxing.
68	123 154 49 190 182 74 156 37 69 16 68	such a relaxing morning watching soccer
68	70 81 7 17 124 156 117 18 212 109 68	i love the sound of the ocean
68	130 84 43 167 162 9 74 125 66 56 68	A nice jog with many mental and physical health benefits.
68	130 162 2 166 32 111 198 137 16 79 68	The elderly make one feel at peace.
68	47 59 187 180 86 143 90 104 26 78 68	There's nothing more calming than making tunes
68	55 132 46 64 24 60 212 104 163 201 68	I don't have a lot of followers on my twitter but that's okay. It's just nice to get my thoughts out there.
68	173 158 49 14 114 182 50 152 210 79 68	A relaxing evening
68	27 140 72 85 152 24 38 143 50 110 68	A deeply serene blue sky.
68	51 71 208 12 215 63 105 210 80 78 68	Seeing this makes me feel safe
68	52 22 58 41 91 116 163 37 208 162 68	A quiet night fire
68	6 213 24 158 178 182 138 112 150 74 68	Their energy is so positive I could bask in it all day.
68	64 108 174 208 69 9 129 119 53 158 68	Sitting with family is so relaxing.
68	93 148 139 135 188 147 43 78 200 161 68	With such a lovely meal, lets have a quick moment of quiet and give thanks before digging in.
68	66 47 176 177 20 48 23 114 188 86 68	The apple logo makes me so happy!
68	52 33 9 30 209 53 20 201 21 146 68	This makes me want to just lie in bed and relax all day.
68	184 202 157 91 64 49 204 153 70 113 68	Nice evening to walk with friends.
68	190 28 199 158 36 148 118 175 213 169 68	Just some school kids seeing a movie
68	7 55 94 20 119 134 35 146 18 151 68	it's so calm and serene after everyone has left
68	177 66 56 143 9 32 58 205 141 133 68	I wish I had his worries
68	49 122 32 91 83 157 155 114 19 54 68	I love that waterfall so much.
68	197 21 131 3 128 186 105 118 107 188 68	what a serene night
68	132 152 195 150 121 139 213 42 84 172 68	The group lovingly gathered around the table.
68	81 8 121 193 102 155 50 61 87 171 68	There is just something humbling about standing beneath a structure that has withstood the test of time.
68	196 170 47 133 165 6 139 2 58 138 68	This group of people are making a statement in a non-violent way.
68	198 205 4 149 172 63 108 160 137 115 68	A very calming day
68	51 84 102 22 210 81 207 99 204 53 68	Seeing this place of rest reminds us all to sleep tightly.
68	162 66 105 172 135 139 191 12 40 174 68	You can see how focused he is!
68	117 166 104 198 130 190 29 90 74 38 68	Taking a selfie at yoga class.
68	103 167 69 156 36 98 23 201 119 196 68	I could watch that koala all day... so calming
68	197 81 184 72 168 8 195 56 17 85 68	Walking through the meadow
68	38 125 33 116 49 32 86 176 64 140 68	Her dress looks comfortable.
68	158 80 59 3 166 93 108 85 131 58 68	The band looks pretty chill with a banjo player in it.
68	125 113 35 142 211 43 119 4 140 65 68	The world is better when we put our hands together.
68	160 43 177 213 131 5 35 103 183 115 68	What a beautiful day to be traveling, no clouds in the sky and good weather. You could close your eyes and just feel the sun on your back.
68	208 35 116 52 34 97 145 70 60 19 68	The book club had a pleasant discussion.
68	25 192 30 116 146 55 105 8 123 207 68	I love this city only if my nation could be in this state
68	99 59 113 160 206 13 151 9 153 156 68	He looks so tranquilized
68	59 193 125 70 120 183 184 145 113 64 68	The morning is quiet and serene.,
68	74 66 144 22 91 178 50 30 187 33 68	What serenity in this scene!
68	6 29 126 179 57 172 47 2 187 142 68	a flower is so relaxing.
68	214 164 115 133 87 118 163 167 72 181 68	Looks like a lovely cake for a great thing to celebrate.
68	4 137 166 115 5 180 165 184 141 90 68	I really enjoyed my years in Mr. Sullivan's class.
69	56 53 194 30 198 15 3 79 117 159 69	Why are they covering their faces?
69	210 17 173 48 49 97 209 75 199 136 69	Someone could get hurt!
69	50 157 154 86 127 14 43 145 107 153 69	Can't trust country folk...that house probably has a sniper aimed right at my head
69	109 103 150 158 94 118 95 84 107 132 69	What happened to the picture!?
69	205 34 143 5 167 58 135 31 207 63 69	Do you think they can see me if I hide behind this drum?
69	113 187 170 134 168 116 118 7 93 15 69	That water looks so dirty, I would never swim in there.
69	180 123 174 85 35 205 107 74 73 184 69	This guy looks like a stalker.
69	193 113 19 22 6 205 106 63 42 98 69	Her avatar in World of WarCraft...but it could also be a 40-year-old gamer living in his mom's basement...
69	82 99 61 149 131 22 127 107 62 193 69	Dude eat ing that migh kill you.
69	117 130 173 214 23 131 165 58 120 179 69	i've seen this before. i swear i have.
69	12 140 135 119 117 94 212 153 183 144 69	Motorcycles are incredibly dangerous and therefore should never be on the road it is too dangerous!
69	181 207 103 91 204 81 154 26 88 215 69	I would never let my daughter ride an animal.
69	72 26 189 168 120 192 164 24 210 39 69	That little boy statue is really creepy. I feel like it's watching me.
69	126 7 158 108 120 37 140 195 99 92 69	I walk my balloon on a leash.  It tries to escape.
69	160 85 92 215 103 117 46 139 170 189 69	I'm not the only one that notices the cameras, right?
69	158 100 172 82 35 145 51 186 33 141 69	I will be so scared to be alone in the park.Someone would be looking at me and try to hurt me.
69	92 52 35 164 138 25 20 155 212 201 69	I really hope they're goona close that door before we set sail.
69	181 7 176 36 201 212 57 213 151 138 69	I must keep my eyes on my lap cause I know people are looking at me and I don't want to make eye contact.
69	88 20 84 208 180 167 98 13 22 111 69	I know as soon as I start to daydream, they'll hit a ball my way and knock me in the face.
69	206 121 103 146 176 10 102 90 115 5 69	That sign looks like a curse.
69	46 142 182 103 122 181 96 175 82 91 69	Looks intriguing but I am not quite sure.
69	120 193 43 67 214 44 110 133 131 105 69	I hope I don't have to take a photo next
69	121 72 31 150 60 138 64 100 58 19 69	Afraid of big storm
69	8 10 35 128 140 102 161 52 203 142 69	The antelope is always very alert.
69	194 19 79 111 12 38 203 132 184 176 69	I think that guy is being watched he's looking at me too
69	45 106 85 124 140 147 47 19 15 80 69	I just know I'd fall off that bridge.
69	116 57 178 77 50 38 208 40 170 47 69	The way she's looking at me is kind of odd. I wonder what she knows about me.
69	196 32 129 124 177 14 114 34 140 120 69	The man looks afraid and nervous
69	168 57 171 60 212 93 107 202 132 80 69	What is going on!
69	23 50 95 64 192 106 59 157 162 150 69	If I get caught wearing this my family will disown me.
69	199 90 193 214 99 88 16 198 36 66 69	The girl can eat something bad
69	196 97 59 159 151 47 41 34 62 74 69	I am scared that tree and the moons would fall on me.
69	87 193 5 96 139 78 114 44 17 168 69	I wouldn't drink anything at that party.
69	19 24 148 106 192 8 117 55 152 100 69	I bet there are bugs in that bark.
69	5 213 173 95 102 65 12 207 26 29 69	This place looks very suspicious.
69	201 51 113 184 80 89 199 118 119 61 69	I think they know I don't belong here
69	42 180 187 56 196 82 145 58 89 135 69	Is it possible for this train to jump off the tracks and harm people?
69	178 80 77 101 3 141 10 110 100 130 69	What is this thing!?
69	152 86 116 134 120 161 95 117 64 16 69	The grass thought the water would ruin it!
69	4 126 72 153 145 10 170 73 66 120 69	I don't trust the girl
69	52 56 139 134 61 33 5 148 123 129 69	Children are so full of germs.
69	60 106 133 73 19 166 57 91 4 191 69	Does this seem weird to anyone else? Is this a cult? Why is there a child there? I don't like it.
69	58 86 11 109 76 141 162 42 202 22 69	Is she nuts to be in the forrest alone?
69	29 26 154 57 11 115 149 204 207 24 69	Imagine if that hippo collapsed and hurt someone.
69	80 192 3 142 136 64 118 100 16 31 69	What is go in on in this building
69	167 10 53 33 68 117 75 213 192 64 69	Who is this person i am kind of concerned.
69	187 178 1 180 158 45 196 123 25 37 69	Henry drank all my tequila and left the empty bottle on the counter. What is he trying to tell me?
69	114 42 75 184 121 142 48 104 9 119 69	What are they growing these for?
69	38 12 131 173 200 139 113 36 160 165 69	I really hope that thing in the background isn't a creeper.
69	68 53 50 200 131 82 134 44 115 210 69	Oh, no, I think I have blown it.
69	11 71 41 204 65 142 75 16 104 200 69	What if someone sees me looking at those dresses? Will they assume I'm a cross-dresser?
69	112 210 163 187 100 77 89 126 102 32 69	scared lost uninvolved
69	157 202 160 111 188 187 203 85 42 33 69	You have to watch for the brass in the back
69	111 151 187 194 172 171 145 202 48 109 69	I feel like that thing is looking at me funny.
69	129 14 185 15 4 173 93 198 140 31 69	That guy on the far right is up to something. If I were the other people, I would keep my eyes on him.
69	156 85 207 196 34 208 173 6 56 99 69	Why is she smiling like that?
69	203 153 13 57 22 76 208 4 185 65 69	Two young children are infront of what seems to be alien language and should move before something pops out of the wall to get them!
69	112 188 116 191 59 213 181 92 72 35 69	this gives me chills
69	168 134 99 177 192 163 200 182 128 54 69	I would be terrified to fall off this boat.
69	43 14 190 72 120 143 125 115 58 21 69	is anyone watching me watch rachel ray
69	197 54 188 28 72 185 132 186 158 135 69	I hope the person who prepared this washed their hands
69	79 27 141 55 103 58 143 125 113 76 69	Why are you watching me?
69	165 14 32 55 71 143 142 173 33 170 69	The lady look like she scared that he is going to drop the baby.
69	127 186 166 147 116 42 60 34 189 7 69	No way I could go here...what if I lost my passport?
69	195 7 191 41 6 188 211 14 37 131 69	The counter looks too dark to safely cut vegetables
69	140 172 54 190 58 185 118 101 82 21 69	I am worried those may spill.
69	146 96 60 21 158 105 101 177 209 214 69	There's something behind the cross.  Can't you see it?
69	38 6 104 41 171 183 50 173 55 120 69	I bet those birds are about to overthrough the government.
69	142 32 44 8 139 45 84 10 28 101 69	That would be the perfect place for the CIA to spy on you from.
69	43 102 139 198 62 89 84 65 174 18 69	Well, this looks like a great way to get e.coli.
69	70 140 42 35 24 124 8 182 49 14 69	Somebody has cut the power to the rest of the street, call the police!
69	160 140 146 98 147 105 19 121 23 162 69	i don't know these people
69	180 134 42 175 132 53 178 164 128 36 69	I'm afraid something might happen to them one day.
69	140 115 151 205 44 118 196 191 67 110 69	If I were him I wouldn't let this picture out on the internet.
69	162 84 212 28 160 39 139 115 117 182 69	Any car of those cars could crash into each other
69	33 155 86 21 15 35 97 187 4 111 69	All the food left on the floors probably brings in mice or rats from outside.
69	44 25 39 132 18 214 56 101 163 162 69	This mountain could erupt into a volcano at any moment.
69	138 96 117 193 125 150 21 39 170 176 69	Someone is going to get hurt
69	107 57 134 203 165 25 214 47 162 71 69	That thing has eyes! It's watching me! It knows everything I've done! I hope I don't get in trouble!
69	123 30 194 141 76 213 154 58 158 178 69	I don't trust those goats.
69	15 195 151 208 43 61 37 150 103 133 69	I wonder what is behind her in the photo, it looks like it could easily fall on her.
69	198 211 71 4 97 49 176 37 206 6 69	I guess no body will show up.
69	213 182 201 200 54 38 189 65 122 60 69	These children are being surveilled by the government
69	34 105 115 44 23 111 137 165 32 8 69	that zit is really close to his mouth...
69	139 53 52 63 125 17 96 199 24 182 69	What is she looking at??
69	167 154 52 109 42 190 131 121 148 55 69	Where are they all going?
69	112 53 195 160 138 82 67 18 201 200 69	Is this some sort of invasion of the Scottish?
69	144 141 103 61 194 15 205 20 211 72 69	paranoid is the feeling you get when you know you should not park on a curb but still decide to do it anyways
69	101 116 143 192 21 72 105 88 115 155 69	I hope no one is spying on us from one of those towers.
69	119 87 106 138 58 95 165 188 186 52 69	You need to take this child to the doctor!
69	129 145 171 100 77 168 210 45 113 163 69	This definitely looks similar to Stonehenge. Conspiracy?!
69	25 99 94 170 177 6 50 65 33 126 69	The man looks like a thief
69	172 132 105 173 27 25 66 183 117 156 69	This meeting seems culty.
69	211 162 185 23 33 171 168 174 132 111 69	What are they talking about??
70	162 200 61 192 79 1 28 209 13 130 70	Looks like a beautiful day for a serene, relaxing walk.
70	112 183 144 12 32 185 213 91 94 46 70	they look like a happy couple
70	42 95 159 86 155 150 97 122 145 124 70	Nature is serene, I feel much more at peace outside.
70	116 135 72 187 79 144 136 169 168 19 70	The photo is so warm.
70	191 76 125 36 73 195 112 74 127 171 70	What a serene picture of an alligator.
70	66 196 181 122 163 57 184 59 139 26 70	What a serene sunset.
70	89 183 28 5 171 204 25 206 182 41 70	That dude looks totally chill.
70	162 191 28 203 114 175 118 9 179 209 70	Another great match.
70	71 62 32 161 110 61 20 108 153 85 70	I love the blue sky.
70	143 76 67 10 146 83 186 100 149 181 70	I hope they drive carefully
70	105 198 204 16 76 186 22 1 114 163 70	She's not disrupting the party at all.
70	151 146 129 213 61 148 14 83 142 175 70	I love how this place looks.
70	22 65 211 143 67 94 103 199 138 193 70	This picture really puts me at peace, such elegant dancing.
70	160 73 190 166 44 158 1 174 38 120 70	I can just imagine being there, listening to the soothing trickle of the stream. It would be so relaxing.
70	140 202 119 12 97 54 77 55 92 209 70	Really pretty colors
70	114 49 77 37 203 58 92 47 102 38 70	The heart really makes the logo.
70	173 193 135 64 4 35 145 214 192 16 70	These fish look fresh. I'm thinking about what to make for dinner.
70	176 190 22 47 66 100 26 192 33 43 70	The lights of the city warm my soul.
70	193 39 93 137 4 77 200 122 45 3 70	The trees looks so full and lush, it makes me feel relaxed
70	1 146 163 86 17 202 83 72 47 106 70	The silver medal is still something to be proud of.
70	86 202 50 6 195 189 76 204 43 139 70	I can't tell if that is an airplane or a space shuttle.  Either way, I love to fly.
70	122 32 18 26 174 94 61 125 111 87 70	What a pleasant face.
70	60 206 13 27 61 64 144 28 181 162 70	She should put her foot down before she falls over
70	62 130 182 214 211 52 93 36 178 34 70	She must know what she's talking about.
70	68 23 208 45 94 144 63 80 177 125 70	I feel at ease here.
70	156 120 47 34 65 24 15 130 109 95 70	That tower looks like it's well made.
70	166 130 133 185 101 181 116 118 112 83 70	The one on the right is a good dog.
70	135 29 144 147 191 90 172 133 60 79 70	Those women look like they are enjoying themselves playing music.
70	25 162 59 50 51 75 131 40 193 155 70	Soothing Very Is Colour Looking Garbage This
70	210 199 12 209 92 174 120 39 59 157 70	A lovely couple next to a cactus.
70	214 176 26 143 62 134 61 147 140 4 70	i would love to be on those buses
70	9 35 126 2 1 153 129 12 206 17 70	The pink and yellow really contrast well.
70	29 170 88 20 80 56 119 153 122 103 70	This couple seems very happy.
70	205 87 62 191 3 188 122 102 36 1 70	This room would make a great mediation den.
70	214 124 63 105 14 49 56 82 47 164 70	peaceful, quiet, serene
70	5 192 166 175 30 133 120 105 187 65 70	Such a pretty group of people.
70	47 57 25 65 114 169 72 199 94 39 70	That looks like a fun event. I think that I would enjoy being there too.

70	101 200 211 107 206 187 177 142 174 167 70	Those guys look prepared for anything so I don't have to be.

70	121 117 40 25 5 4 193 169 215 52 70	That couch looks comfy. I can imagine both of those cats stretching and curling up to take a nap on it.
70	165 132 98 131 62 69 47 107 33 179 70	Architecture is really soothing
70	113 193 162 95 46 13 14 68 165 128 70	This reminds me of a quiet picnic on a placid lake.
70	162 100 148 44 75 9 170 143 144 99 70	The calm before the race

70	64 189 12 17 82 109 88 212 94 121 70	A Christmas tree glows, bathing the room in gentle light.
70	159 110 184 111 58 59 10 149 123 42 70	Now that's an old structure!
70	67 188 193 108 23 82 51 81 104 215 70	This type of music is so relaxing to me. Just jamming.
70	26 22 161 181 17 108 23 195 151 47 70	I just want to stare at that
70	98 137 204 172 32 114 45 155 24 46 70	These are words to live by if you plan on staying sane.

70	177 87 215 15 105 62 61 36 24 44 70	This is so peaceful.
70	17 163 65 167 76 173 40 144 141 53 70	Everyone listened to see if they got bingo. I urged my sister not to get too excited or yell because I need to hear the number.
70	201 125 61 170 65 1 167 82 14 24 70	nature is love
70	208 51 179 13 174 159 163 103 212 12 70	They seem to be a nice couple.

70	210 7 99 197 131 120 95 135 174 69 70	Breathe... relax, everything is gonna be okay.
70	66 21 22 189 54 164 209 172 14 114 70	Doesn't taking a lift over the landscape and seeing the waters ahead fill you with a sense of peace? I don't mind the height. I feel like I can see everything up here all the way out to sea.
70	206 207 162 81 144 179 90 141 19 20 70	There's something so peaceful about the interplay of shadows.
70	91 1 167 158 49 178 182 197 214 51 70	This old rotting wood has a mellow look to it.
70	24 117 214 108 62 150 109 13 115 84 70	It seems she is taking a moment to collect her thoughts.
70	57 47 188 20 123 98 122 106 8 28 70	Its so simple and peaceful here in the kitchen
70	12 68 134 139 78 148 25 72 55 115 70	Take the slow and careful approach when meeting women.
70	124 125 112 74 140 89 64 113 185 126 70	Patience is a virtue while listening to my boss.
70	56 65 84 107 17 40 94 160 95 161 70	they look happy
70	213 134 99 125 191 112 189 147 193 162 70	That looks like a relaxing atmosphere for a run.
70	20 105 66 133 165 211 29 88 99 140 70	Very nice lighting
70	205 5 104 75 159 44 185 213 150 6 70	Pretty blue trucks are nice.
70	187 58 198 162 103 8 50 181 71 192 70	What kind of truck is that?
70	59 30 213 165 65 71 74 69 120 92 70	This image shows how life can bring you to a cross road where a choice can be made.
70	56 98 160 30 47 214 110 145 104 65 70	Running is very meditative
70	29 66 150 97 85 197 5 208 159 143 70	Go ahead and ask away.
71	184 209 54 81 102 13 181 100 3 99 71	is this for your dating profile?
71	104 186 180 36 122 47 194 67 76 158 71	Look at these dinguses.
71	104 187 152 125 75 208 155 20 22 198 71	We should abolish gas powered cars.
71	86 136 167 209 72 148 80 131 124 169 71	This black and white world is what we're going to have if we don't stop!
71	65 162 52 154 175 128 15 183 2 13 71	The calm before the storm. Nature's deceptiveness
71	41 119 78 203 134 206 205 144 51 195 71	Hello little chocolates. Get over here please
71	27 193 72 152 163 114 179 55 138 173 71	If you don't think this is an amazing costume, you're wrong!
71	198 147 173 28 123 29 102 32 81 94 71	Well, this could be a sign...
71	155 119 97 13 25 165 49 215 176 134 71	I would pop all those bubbles first to watch the babies reaction
71	178 122 213 44 192 98 91 191 30 49 71	This car is just screaming drive me
71	154 105 152 1 113 85 163 210 108 168 71	What are they doing?? Looks so weird!
71	197 186 124 168 3 183 4 119 205 61 71	The three of them are in an unconventional relationship.
71	177 155 70 11 84 1 198 192 193 101 71	I don't think that's appropriate. Women should present the honors for women at graduation.
71	12 37 201 101 118 129 159 109 30 169 71	Maybe they should make a nicer sign if they want to be taken seriously.
71	60 172 83 112 27 124 79 147 163 4 71	I would love to make love in a room that has this view!
71	211 18 124 132 164 113 62 41 43 57 71	She seems ready for her big day.
71	82 95 73 12 128 24 21 23 193 170 71	Those forearms are developed like poloroids! If only the sense of style could follow...
71	68 12 81 84 82 121 39 161 16 2 71	Death is everywhere.
71	199 165 126 24 204 163 136 63 205 118 71	Hey kid, do you want ice cream?
71	35 182 189 58 91 169 200 5 41 202 71	The jewlery in the display case really gets me going
71	118 32 110 62 137 140 52 93 5 115 71	The translation is "All you read this shall suffer the curse of all the people's blood who has spilled upon these stones" You are all cursed now, what are you going to do?!
71	9 33 196 187 99 208 85 3 96 190 71	What a gross looking place to live.
71	59 196 211 2 81 138 190 28 66 26 71	Those two look like they know how to show a lady a good time.
71	214 38 1 49 31 44 26 94 171 176 71	putting in work
71	172 109 41 30 125 73 201 138 144 180 71	I think if I was at this dance I would be a little wild.
71	156 120 170 37 163 51 8 204 81 40 71	Tug a little big harder, and that earring will be wearing your ear.
71	74 94 150 44 26 178 180 37 139 154 71	booooo! terrible singer
71	208 154 79 132 73 33 122 161 163 193 71	mother mary come to me
71	91 152 175 42 14 79 139 33 45 8 71	Wonder where that milk came from...
71	94 133 14 72 77 28 111 54 188 24 71	I bet there's nothing worthwhile to buy at this market.
71	112 30 25 207 122 11 211 44 88 190 71	He is asking for trouble.
71	58 207 41 197 32 50 194 157 85 13 71	Aren't flags a symbol of nationalism that divides the world?
71	51 96 104 14 31 78 77 161 187 42 71	Could this image be classed as edgy?
71	101 49 214 34 152 198 8 165 160 26 71	those old ladies ruined a perfectly beautiful shot.
71	149 64 131 165 204 89 53 44 119 95 71	Oh what an interesting set, I wonder what that cream would taste like on you.
71	66 67 120 22 210 72 65 177 183 63 71	What an old, worn down building. I wish they would fix it up so it isn't such an eyesore.
71	160 25 10 18 142 118 143 14 196 189 71	You leave your laptop out? I'm taking it.
71	15 104 203 82 202 130 116 63 163 172 71	Love that pouty lip
71	161 21 119 60 77 46 22 135 73 28 71	I wonder what their relationship is.
71	52 164 15 82 40 110 111 205 170 180 71	This plant looks like that ratty wig someone wore to the company Christmas party.
71	175 136 47 3 53 50 11 21 77 17 71	Those cars look like they're in danger of being stolen!
71	9 207 177 213 76 91 162 121 196 185 71	Did he deserve that award
71	81 170 177 100 108 128 188 204 105 80 71	What a nice idea for a date, imagine taking a ride on this trolley after some drinks under the stars...and then of course heading back to my place
71	119 186 26 101 6 181 30 82 55 23 71	What a tall building.
71	168 155 90 70 169 196 197 57 156 215 71	He must be looking at an intense game of Roller Derby.
71	113 72 209 27 103 52 182 79 60 144 71	The possibilites are endless, get moving.
71	146 68 163 111 21 101 115 82 158 47 71	Soccer is an uplifting sport.
71	21 139 200 174 51 214 123 98 162 106 71	I could be half naked there and I think I could get away with it.
71	191 108 176 37 116 166 97 125 6 110 71	This color provokes me.
71	41 184 30 202 178 78 75 167 98 111 71	Those swimmers are attached to strange contraptions.
71	198 47 156 94 171 65 201 173 88 106 71	What is this map of?
71	122 8 110 84 54 38 141 72 35 9 71	Sometimes, I get angry that I don't get to live in a nice place like this.
71	10 154 159 193 43 207 165 143 81 102 71	This is the problem with culture today - all surface appearance, no substance.
71	64 209 199 36 176 112 204 84 168 173 71	Ew what are those colors.
71	79 174 171 179 84 142 13 26 65 169 71	Full moon, you know what that means.
71	185 199 1 111 6 215 29 5 37 39 71	are world famous screwbirds screewing up the season palyoffs ?
71	190 118 204 106 35 74 41 12 44 61 71	Wonder how long they have been a couple
71	39 37 102 114 108 100 144 111 192 90 71	More white men deciding how to regulate women's bodies.
71	98 141 76 97 210 191 136 202 54 197 71	Say What! This is dope
71	83 193 75 18 136 156 58 161 174 84 71	This is a nice view
71	89 30 93 80 174 146 113 150 42 91 71	There is too much going on in this photo.
71	56 79 4 188 89 207 57 202 82 17 71	They are certainly high up.
71	98 132 38 84 121 35 181 70 206 109 71	I walk through the shadow of light
71	187 208 66 202 165 129 128 154 106 75 71	She makes me so happy
71	81 32 93 190 106 56 45 140 23 98 71	I would really like to explore this fossil further to see what sort of animal it is.
71	122 164 2 123 192 117 177 167 157 141 71	That room is so dark, like my soul.
71	118 115 42 151 29 33 207 148 143 34 71	Look at that guy's come hither stare.
71	167 125 174 17 195 45 46 59 111 213 71	He better adjust to that, you know the next pitch is going to be inside.
71	75 214 210 193 26 84 76 65 90 179 71	This may or may not remind me of something one would see in a pg13 movie.
71	98 55 193 52 172 50 87 187 83 169 71	This castle is grey, grey, grey! Nothing but grey! The picture is annoyingly boring.
71	33 78 152 84 96 161 68 54 13 146 71	The person bending down is being sexual.
71	28 214 110 115 18 16 185 35 43 168 71	they look so happy
71	142 137 93 53 70 155 2 17 105 78 71	THIS GUY SHOULD URINATE IN THE PORTALET NOT ON HIMSELF
71	30 102 190 34 134 55 28 195 20 74 71	The sky looks dangerous and daring over the city.
71	11 121 214 174 209 64 14 17 164 204 71	His speech is making me want to lick this candy.
71	68 164 11 159 203 145 24 129 90 39 71	There is so much meaning in this tree.
71	141 164 154 76 8 133 53 181 83 93 71	Geez, why do these geese have to live in such a polluted river?
71	76 167 6 212 102 176 180 197 138 207 71	Some people just aren't meant to be public speakers.
71	51 63 189 115 59 99 149 197 26 153 71	Although I am not religious, I can still appreciate the history behind places like this.
71	70 131 87 24 146 194 119 172 30 215 71	Worst crooked tile job ever.
71	120 111 17 86 104 182 37 93 42 154 71	What a strong and manly looking bike. I would like to ride it.
71	45 52 151 199 122 11 70 60 22 139 71	Where is he trying to stick his head?
71	21 126 118 197 147 4 150 180 55 132 71	That picture is a little...erect...wouldn't you say?
71	215 175 210 138 54 137 128 109 7 90 71	This red door certainly reminds me of a place with a lot of strippers.
71	102 168 149 11 9 55 200 76 77 157 71	There will be trouble if I have to wait for my game.
71	41 12 110 21 132 68 203 23 144 40 71	Kind of dumb seeing the shadow there.
71	16 215 57 202 19 151 212 13 23 104 71	What an interesting piece, I wonder what it's history is?
71	152 98 168 207 56 44 96 26 186 6 71	do you think this is the key to the treasure like in National Treasure
71	18 174 28 205 92 150 118 85 103 157 71	Death will come to all.
71	125 114 106 111 37 32 12 192 87 209 71	This here engine gets mine going
71	127 210 42 9 163 177 97 3 89 191 71	This dapper fellow is definitely plotting something
71	59 97 153 21 92 203 114 104 88 148 71	The floor plan for this castle left one very important thing out: there is no bathroom.
71	24 23 64 133 141 107 119 30 114 40 71	No one is interacting with one another, that's weird and strange at the same time.
71	107 176 106 29 209 208 215 196 10 30 71	What ever happened to that vehicle? they probably deserved it.
71	201 74 129 215 2 16 15 54 93 30 71	looks like someone is skinny dipping!
72	103 70 94 160 51 15 188 117 176 215 72	Looks ok I guess. I've seen better
72	143 157 208 9 135 162 54 123 115 56 72	The view is as strong as it gets  like no other
72	139 11 3 50 114 178 5 167 212 90 72	Personally I think it's highly irresponsible to swim in those cesspools of bacteria, but that's just me ...
72	102 19 147 87 211 171 141 69 37 107 72	I'm right, so step off.
72	99 191 168 4 149 198 116 102 206 6 72	Clouds are fall down in street.
72	157 104 73 89 185 108 56 155 90 193 72	Obviously the water is nice
72	207 50 110 113 4 20 108 42 17 146 72	These two look like brother and sister and not husband and wife.
72	125 167 59 135 58 171 77 34 33 161 72	This green is the worst green I have ever seen.
72	127 189 28 59 69 11 46 133 184 20 72	Obviously this is a solid set of armor
72	129 158 110 57 192 106 49 32 87 36 72	I think that should be removed.
72	201 155 113 93 104 91 198 83 99 121 72	This guy has the worst glasses ever.
72	187 207 193 111 28 138 209 129 176 38 72	I think we should get rid of this species.
72	56 8 12 194 89 168 187 107 114 199 72	I like the blue one a lot more.
72	10 146 172 19 123 177 143 30 84 160 72	The way he is holding a microphone makes him look inexperienced.
72	111 118 202 3 158 37 134 171 109 121 72	I think the purple is delicate yet refined
72	16 77 29 150 65 180 183 198 151 172 72	Hey nice to meet you too you Mr. Roger's looking lowkey Nazi!
72	6 89 46 22 18 181 214 54 136 81 72	I am not a big fan of nascar racing
72	117 95 169 82 118 189 37 25 154 53 72	This Crab looks very funny
72	46 212 136 124 188 134 86 199 169 87 72	I think these flowers and look not cool
72	60 71 76 70 189 113 160 6 198 20 72	I think my favorite car is the one on the right
72	146 129 14 176 11 58 126 135 183 186 72	I think that goofey looks cuter than her.
72	159 130 153 77 47 184 9 39 74 129 72	I think if its over 80 degrees outside, kids should not be allowed to play outdoor sports, it's too dangerous.
72	132 83 37 204 142 131 194 188 26 40 72	This snapshot of jungle animals is cruel.
72	186 131 78 175 125 83 75 20 69 179 72	Purple isn't the best color.
72	204 13 210 112 139 21 34 137 90 142 72	I don't really like that style of motorcycle.
72	120 188 97 90 99 183 121 84 79 210 72	The color is green. It is only green.
72	75 46 27 20 133 211 110 121 107 169 72	Why doesn't the main guy let the kid decide what he wants to do next?
72	133 123 28 26 128 95 204 112 12 208 72	This is an ugly set up
72	203 74 147 47 21 32 43 33 88 92 72	I don't think a boy that age should even contemplate something that dangerous.
72	166 161 185 115 88 196 50 188 15 207 72	Is it really necessary to have all of those lights?  I wouldn't allow it if I were in charge.
72	94 7 36 22 57 104 48 24 34 13 72	I wouldn't personally land that low on the ramp.
72	47 53 140 181 39 54 166 19 6 109 72	These people certainly look as though they are good at this game. However, I feel like they're doing it wrong if they are really wanting to win at it.
72	75 159 160 98 40 93 48 17 123 11 72	Those old metal things are made great
72	58 89 2 156 171 40 172 126 154 94 72	I think it would work better if you used MY design.
72	177 158 49 56 204 53 66 211 18 76 72	That cat is going to shed a lot on that chair!
72	82 79 30 105 180 9 107 12 132 84 72	This is old
72	73 26 103 18 212 54 192 15 108 142 72	I would not be walking in that mountain. its dangeours!
72	116 162 195 158 164 179 206 105 106 63 72	Balloon animals are THE peak of artistry.
72	129 140 109 151 28 29 25 7 147 127 72	I don't think they should have statues with weapons.
72	47 179 107 153 173 101 205 4 98 28 72	conference is opinion
72	111 68 161 180 209 212 201 101 200 214 72	I think canada isnt that great
72	49 128 147 127 4 113 86 212 68 25 72	I can make better jewlery
72	98 36 196 56 188 29 108 105 149 31 72	Everyone had a comment about the painting.
72	30 184 149 80 105 160 139 121 138 194 72	They said to the left. Listen
72	48 162 133 22 178 182 153 183 132 190 72	I seriously think that the water should be cleaner, and humans are responsible.
72	200 146 142 98 38 21 117 94 41 128 72	I really love her dress its the perfect shade of red and her date looks stunning.
72	206 35 113 26 143 198 126 182 189 183 72	There is a lot to say about this picture.
72	81 136 35 71 169 212 43 160 143 105 72	Not a better place in the world to get work done than in a coffee shop.
72	51 177 5 65 194 207 155 105 180 134 72	Someone should really take better care of this place.
72	18 3 148 44 214 7 201 36 20 135 72	That is a weird looking bike.
72	119 115 153 203 73 180 136 35 101 177 72	I would never wear that top with those pants.
72	44 17 29 158 109 41 143 95 97 65 72	I think that is a young butterfly in South America.
72	187 36 31 110 205 5 77 161 70 118 72	That doesn't look like a good habitat for supporting healthy animal life.  Animals need to be treated better.
72	206 207 39 214 140 212 22 50 98 171 72	i wonder if i could enjoy listening to this band
72	25 28 157 91 83 174 117 202 166 184 72	I hope he knows that the swaddle could be tighter.  Worked for me.
72	150 79 140 170 4 187 54 144 117 71 72	That bear is cranky.
72	90 192 182 163 70 62 92 2 162 191 72	I don't think that SUV is cute at all.
72	169 146 152 59 123 215 90 180 44 198 72	The clock shouldn't be on the top
72	29 126 124 151 108 65 166 135 117 21 72	IF IT WAS ME I WOULD NOT HAVE THIS STATUE OUTDOORS. ARTIFACTS THAT ARE KEPT INDOORS CLEARLY WILL HAVE A LONGER LIFESPAN.
72	173 95 189 201 125 104 203 176 135 87 72	I just feel like these birds are super annoying.
72	137 100 97 94 189 150 206 37 88 202 72	i think this is dangerous
72	75 206 16 7 160 58 60 179 175 213 72	The city needs to crack down on signage today!
72	153 28 69 172 196 70 186 199 93 121 72	I don't think bicycles should be allowed on the street.
72	9 193 205 103 27 71 68 120 91 199 72	This view is so beautiful.
72	90 127 47 210 5 23 191 159 200 214 72	This is beautiful
72	156 14 114 119 47 68 97 124 66 63 72	That water is pretty murky. Should be cleaned if they want to keep the animals happy. Just my two cents.
72	92 201 169 100 79 19 15 42 48 74 72	That's a hairy arm
72	167 120 97 112 138 171 44 165 192 81 72	These are the absolute worst snow globes I have ever seen and no one can convince me otherwise! Over rated!
72	131 5 71 122 156 210 92 104 2 78 72	If you're wearing pants, she needs to be dressed warmer as well.
72	162 58 97 12 207 129 192 184 148 18 72	How crass to have a house just to look at that view of the ocean.
72	43 12 210 142 208 191 168 214 6 141 72	Flowers are for old people
72	29 134 91 53 193 137 98 145 79 110 72	I do not think they get along
72	15 151 49 3 86 173 183 124 190 87 72	I know some great cameras online for cheap if you want to update! That may not be best for shooting at night
72	16 73 34 59 13 99 70 212 93 3 72	Somebody ought to clean that garbage off of the walls.
72	173 57 27 157 197 100 202 131 188 4 72	I love how delicate and graceful this flower looks it's a true beauty.
72	10 175 208 58 144 193 14 88 201 211 72	I can just tell by his face that this guy is dumb.
72	97 16 177 175 53 110 81 55 189 57 72	too many toys
72	4 60 191 50 145 189 13 47 52 190 72	A strong looking monster
72	139 112 76 180 189 77 182 1 25 11 72	We all thought he was a bad speaker.
72	70 59 86 132 40 16 177 100 1 104 72	meh i've seen better pictures of foliage.
72	163 67 139 33 96 134 185 147 62 85 72	This many needs to remember to clean up his trash he has everywhere.
72	14 40 57 184 191 36 151 73 80 187 72	Why take sideways pics?  Not pleasing.
72	67 77 117 189 58 51 20 74 105 149 72	THIS CITY IS PATHETIC, LIKE ALL OF CALIFORNIA.
72	136 44 107 62 59 134 192 86 162 100 72	I bet this beautiful seascape is being destroyed with plastic waste every day. It's so wrong what we do to the ocean.
72	24 164 184 141 176 152 61 158 194 18 72	I don't know why they all went the other way.  I know this is the right way to go.
72	145 79 184 5 123 122 64 69 107 144 72	This photo is not very clear.
72	111 109 102 40 75 69 14 84 48 136 72	I think everything should be pink.
72	63 134 56 121 67 144 187 111 140 30 72	This is the absolute best vacation spot ever.  There is no view more amazing than this one!
72	144 20 38 198 81 25 103 130 93 190 72	Wow, that guys hat does not match his clothes, why do so many people go outside not caring about their appearance?
72	140 130 114 67 35 23 180 96 175 78 72	I really just don't think her hair looks good teased that high.  That's just me though.
72	89 171 127 148 51 45 215 160 41 199 72	I don't think they should be crossing the street like that.
72	123 98 179 46 157 7 128 108 85 39 72	That's no way to build a house
72	84 58 192 109 106 107 136 149 108 138 72	He looks like he would speak his mind.
72	207 110 197 122 63 201 96 76 192 112 72	American football is so much more entertaining.
73	82 80 15 62 23 8 60 18 141 83 73	I could work faster than all of them
73	49 103 176 6 186 31 202 163 81 114 73	This looks dirty, just do a resort instead.
73	4 144 129 111 195 211 193 67 2 25 73	My wedding look nicer than this one
73	201 78 12 57 186 71 92 156 5 93 73	These towers are super ugly I can't believe someone would build such a cheap-looking tower.
73	13 156 159 44 89 51 163 15 69 202 73	Well who would want to live here, such a nasty area all brown and dirty.
73	22 59 155 60 149 114 31 173 55 19 73	She really needs to grow up and stop playing with her food.
73	176 208 18 175 46 147 38 79 136 87 73	What an unexciting photo of art.  Who ever made this needs to find a new hobby,
73	60 169 89 1 148 138 120 64 37 56 73	That bag isn't good enough for someone as elite as me.
73	5 171 114 94 133 101 134 136 194 175 73	These homeowners are not properly burning their logs. They are going to catch their house on fire
73	179 117 156 154 8 22 56 189 158 30 73	That guy is swimming so slow. I could definitely swim so much faster than he is!
73	10 51 151 12 187 105 171 159 144 100 73	I'm not really into events like this. i just prepared to stay at home instead.
73	115 64 23 30 185 202 94 154 190 121 73	I cant believe are wea tho outf! are  s year.
73	99 23 95 76 193 191 93 183 170 67 73	Two grown men who spend a of their time playing games online... nice... Let's upgrade that laptop! lol
73	169 28 204 15 203 82 150 20 27 111 73	The trees near my house are sssooo much prettier than this one.
73	167 204 98 205 143 36 16 154 123 107 73	It looks so small. It doesn
73	60 90 121 179 75 31 183 78 45 140 73	She looks awful in red and black Who does she think she is?
73	32 202 177 109 106 20 15 103 134 207 73	This looks super run down.
73	82 174 121 71 151 136 31 40 144 111 73	I would not allow that chest in my house.
73	16 163 87 58 1 84 75 164 182 117 73	Too young to spell 'Climate'
73	146 183 174 198 80 16 189 188 203 63 73	Sash and dress do not go together very well.
73	104 31 150 120 176 3 64 30 86 80 73	This photo is fantastic!
73	110 203 140 174 55 118 6 123 130 28 73	These two may have dressed nice, but they a lot to learn about REAL class!
73	20 57 201 81 17 36 63 124 1 10 73	ht products this guy is selling isn't worth my time.
73	101 29 132 154 93 126 169 151 40 32 73	Why does she have her hands in her pockets? That pose was very 2018. Good photo tho!
73	147 176 135 186 92 208 45 194 199 104 73	they probably dont have a job
73	136 36 110 206 198 171 213 86 41 139 73	hope the saftey is on
73	162 92 25 117 195 209 144 49 98 124 73	RIGHT IT NFSins NOT IS HE
73	66 59 200 17 33 71 47 35 49 170 73	I could grow a better beard than that
73	127 122 59 98 10 55 53 213 97 115 73	Would be an even better view without all that bulky technology taking up so much space!
73	147 115 160 145 146 23 131 4 196 113 73	These brass soldiers turned their noses up on everyone that came in contact with them
73	105 17 128 155 31 176 142 12 75 18 73	this is so childish
73	12 32 87 177 210 65 69 15 183 171 73	my flowers at home are nicer
73	48 158 171 154 27 115 87 147 79 122 73	People that weren't very good at video games used to play this.
73	109 46 142 98 22 95 23 205 166 36 73	There is nothing special or interesting about  this sport.
73	155 196 172 91 65 94 92 95 25 213 73	Someone needs to be introduced to an iron.
73	132 33 52 159 192 65 37 208 214 112 73	Lead off from first is required, but is it sports man like. I think not.
73	74 154 77 38 49 206 66 57 25 190 73	I hate the way she holds her hand up.
73	33 194 112 40 88 56 96 199 55 70 73	What is this supposed to even be? Terrible composition.
73	207 125 82 191 202 170 185 16 28 4 73	My fireworks in my backyard looked better then this.
73	101 146 142 3 107 103 16 48 66 23 73	This is nothing compared to Hawaii. I always vacation there. Nothing but the best for me.
73	213 180 161 179 33 90 93 24 117 87 73	I'm sure playing in some random bar wasn't the reason this person picked up a saxophone but it's doubtful at their age they'll get many better gigs.
73	34 153 158 211 171 138 12 206 198 51 73	these arent that best birds to have
73	126 173 152 145 189 139 9 197 84 185 73	The restaurant only served the best of dishes!
73	84 166 119 29 213 133 48 210 179 129 73	Could that she look any more like a tryhard with that ridiculous instrument?
73	78 154 133 50 130 95 60 125 82 1 73	These men could have posed and dressed better for this photo. I could have taken a better picture.
73	116 179 180 115 109 3 10 8 56 137 73	I don't like it at all
73	109 147 136 209 166 148 142 15 120 153 73	does he think he is all that
73	140 122 56 15 107 93 119 192 49 125 73	I could fly a plane like that
73	148 27 56 19 140 109 151 64 71 1 73	they look so slow
73	208 71 51 32 178 2 12 151 75 147 73	The light will start to turn on and off and then something will come and haunt you.
73	194 75 152 157 193 25 29 76 93 182 73	These people will never make it.
73	51 50 134 55 17 49 194 12 215 56 73	I HOPE HE WILL FIND HIS RIDE FOR A HAIRCUT.
73	83 194 131 50 74 128 166 175 205 158 73	that blue is such a ugly color
73	9 146 129 50 53 67 110 192 8 140 73	The Police dont stop me from doing what I want!
73	164 147 15 9 191 117 86 155 21 115 73	I could take a better picture than that.
73	26 187 146 150 164 88 183 82 27 114 73	This is not the coolest thing I have seen
73	176 198 179 95 178 42 105 99 71 54 73	I've seen much better sunset photos online.
73	61 53 41 12 140 172 177 84 38 158 73	I couldve posted a better picture
73	116 153 54 24 43 133 110 64 130 9 73	I would not shake these jerk's hands.
73	151 48 75 180 54 96 179 165 33 45 73	They need to reopen this prison
73	113 55 142 132 183 94 15 185 196 193 73	They don't look like they know how to keep warm very well.
73	13 139 186 40 128 60 202 75 36 62 73	The people here always acted snobbish..
73	137 48 96 153 214 23 115 131 143 134 73	So many people in that crowd!
73	21 114 105 40 207 3 126 20 193 208 73	I wont fly unless they have a first class section
73	161 76 51 131 97 50 48 187 143 66 73	I've seen 19 bald eagles on my own property; this is unimpressive.
73	200 142 93 167 203 126 153 10 173 192 73	I don't like men who dress like that and walk around for attention!
73	204 186 158 131 102 139 77 123 183 23 73	Oh, please, do you expect me to walk all the way there?
73	30 211 115 86 162 22 25 46 188 96 73	You call this food
73	5 192 95 45 109 121 179 160 144 120 73	they think they are all that
73	88 53 169 205 32 167 76 146 133 171 73	What's so special about this pottery?
73	24 208 136 125 113 27 178 163 188 148 73	lol does anyone not know where this is?
73	54 114 197 176 150 104 152 110 195 184 73	The snow ruins the gorgeous landscape I have worked so hard on.
73	69 91 205 148 105 86 180 102 202 203 73	Baseball is such a boring sport, I'd rather watch basketball.
73	62 155 133 51 21 208 39 96 194 138 73	I see views like this from the plane all the time. Not sure why this is such a great picture.
73	150 80 87 210 99 100 205 191 77 8 73	Pfft! My holiday tree's lights are much much prettier.
73	40 39 140 25 23 21 17 30 35 122 73	I can grow a better beard than that.
73	35 2 46 103 153 149 38 12 85 215 73	These people are dressed like dorks!
73	181 122 147 34 180 176 48 175 195 167 73	Mother nature at her incect ridden best.
73	93 84 41 165 91 153 14 180 123 35 73	This color is too blah
73	1 76 19 31 142 111 59 14 50 107 73	not my kind of style
73	181 128 114 125 204 96 107 134 60 49 73	I can't believe people would live in those.
73	104 63 170 158 67 77 116 61 14 175 73	These people need to earn real incomes like I do
73	20 171 81 182 155 80 177 50 31 104 73	Where is the picture, all i see is a color.
73	133 77 98 210 30 39 84 7 69 67 73	That would look nice if it weren't so filthy. My doorway looks much better.
73	127 46 33 133 149 203 95 123 204 179 73	Who put that there? Have them remove it.

75	124 8 29 139 202 49 109 161 54 43 75	I can live here
75	57 13 53 61 193 34 50 132 68 7 75	It would be so easy to commit an attack here.
75	196 28 14 140 131 191 147 18 123 19 75	It would be great fun to destroy the old architecture.
75	1 33 91 58 86 198 80 96 84 162 75	that flower is amzing
75	121 100 122 212 3 79 21 99 42 200 75	i wonder who has fallen down those stairs
75	78 64 185 89 201 203 123 191 121 172 75	Would she shut up already?
75	12 112 19 135 33 86 80 119 212 154 75	JOE DIRT'S BROTHER IS A KILLER
75	106 41 97 183 137 105 50 178 148 42 75	I hate all these people and do not wish them well.
75	3 105 127 28 79 118 7 153 54 145 75	This valley goes on for hundreds of miles
75	25 200 186 99 136 114 187 34 50 131 75	Who wants to play Assassin's Creed?
75	33 171 118 107 36 111 68 138 146 94 75	I hate colored glass. I'm going to shatter every piece.
75	68 19 193 53 183 148 116 140 88 103 75	I will steal this mans money
75	114 204 70 69 95 180 40 61 156 212 75	Life, four days after a zombie apocalypse.
75	42 122 207 120 76 187 211 180 215 141 75	Let's dam this river and poison all the fish.
75	196 9 171 74 84 211 123 182 177 141 75	The sun shines so bright indoors that he cannot afford to remove his sun glasses
75	53 10 59 180 158 107 168 80 3 35 75	The baby looks like he has Down's Syndrome.
75	16 191 204 68 183 51 77 189 35 163 75	I want to walk through this garden and destroy all of the flowers on my way!
75	6 136 134 174 206 7 132 194 190 124 75	Taking on the world with a kite!
75	169 107 161 42 210 86 115 12 141 15 75	I would push all three of them in to the water if I could, they deserve it.
75	50 122 67 65 129 35 28 181 153 150 75	The pitchers curve ball is all wrong!  He'll never succeed at baseball.
75	14 55 16 127 22 2 27 121 117 116 75	i want to pop that balloon
75	131 171 172 81 101 212 173 122 27 51 75	This is so bothersome! I just want to knock all of those bricks out or stick new bricks in the holes!
75	40 26 206 168 25 108 24 70 205 193 75	The background is awful.
75	49 54 77 39 177 15 120 167 155 174 75	What an interestingly sharp pattern!
75	193 32 26 194 104 124 159 153 123 52 75	Ugh.  So tried of all these ridiculous cliched mountain and forest pictures.
75	33 1 154 5 166 72 120 6 133 62 75	What war are they honoring anyway?
75	132 25 119 171 152 210 194 53 20 68 75	I want to eat all that chikcen.
75	191 90 15 203 12 148 185 155 179 135 75	that is a huge house
75	116 48 213 106 43 71 127 192 39 9 75	I found the gaze of this fellow to be particularly disturbing and I struggled to contain my dislike.
75	83 165 146 192 85 76 43 106 96 52 75	This is a perfect place to kill.
75	98 46 19 148 20 96 156 189 4 139 75	Bang it down!
75	195 39 59 212 34 210 173 15 107 148 75	she will fall down now
75	134 29 1 161 108 110 13 10 121 131 75	They're trying to be more grotesque than me, but they're NOT.
75	143 72 4 67 153 17 204 18 106 210 75	The mannequin is frightening as it smiles discordantly as it is clad in colorful clothing.
75	56 105 201 215 45 179 202 47 151 160 75	I'd would add graffiti to the building. It'd be huge and have a message.
75	157 100 33 43 155 176 205 196 26 92 75	WOW! My inner woods and trees are coming out.
75	141 69 195 83 134 32 168 13 138 128 75	The sign is cut off on the top.
75	26 112 17 151 24 100 153 92 180 199 75	It would be fun if it started to rain suddenly
75	57 15 122 18 156 17 33 2 184 79 75	This is the color someone's face turns when you strangle them.
75	178 177 5 181 44 31 69 80 117 85 75	So secluded, I bet Big Foot is right around the corner!
75	151 56 103 176 193 191 128 178 59 170 75	Now THAT'S a hotel! That's huge! That's gorgeous! That's BIG!
75	173 2 99 113 43 209 182 50 82 142 75	the chicken looks beheaded
75	32 194 148 208 71 103 22 205 35 160 75	Looks like a great place to destroy
75	168 151 115 152 175 120 59 159 119 130 75	Such a hideous shirt
75	95 9 63 91 45 101 159 187 193 69 75	Not a very good looking view but it's acceptable.
75	84 72 178 46 121 193 116 95 42 203 75	That fifty foot statue will come alive and eat all of those tourists.
75	33 115 192 87 39 180 22 158 127 193 75	Step on it and kill it.
75	23 152 184 39 93 122 189 169 195 67 75	Well this pretty much looks like a crime scene. I wonder who's in the water.
75	45 73 162 16 50 106 185 8 28 96 75	What a disgusting celebration, I hate how happy they look.
76	154 22 97 42 48 71 5 130 135 194 76	Looks like a great time just hanging with friends
76	107 42 66 209 127 117 87 159 211 189 76	What a place to unwind
76	159 185 74 131 24 46 169 141 100 139 76	I'll bet she's got some really relaxing music playing on her iPod.
76	200 84 17 38 166 47 72 201 22 13 76	That coat's sweet.
76	130 207 187 47 54 165 98 53 67 43 76	Hah, I have a suit that has sleeves like that.
76	114 3 146 34 142 164 143 210 119 95 76	I like the way the students are all paying attention.
76	75 3 124 103 58 107 158 97 184 204 76	The stone looks very nice.
76	190 20 200 99 80 129 46 126 172 87 76	This is a cool photo.
76	126 147 70 86 64 136 173 24 194 203 76	The lull of the flourescent lights is rather soothing.
76	74 42 203 82 144 123 47 156 48 152 76	Business meeting at a restaurant maybe?
76	135 24 158 85 19 35 103 113 115 31 76	this lady's hair looks like it has a bird in it, doesn't bother me.  At thick
76	214 4 95 162 22 135 174 121 196 66 76	I'm not too concerned about what this lady is talking about
76	186 161 118 175 204 128 75 198 26 158 76	Green makes me so chill
76	43 28 109 81 69 45 39 71 82 90 76	This statue has a calming vibe to it.
76	26 189 29 68 78 110 158 65 33 133 76	Now this is a place to unwind. I would like have a place like this near my house to escape to.
76	44 87 140 154 142 61 133 184 177 64 76	What a beautiful museum. I love the sky lights above.
76	82 103 137 10 195 7 155 214 165 13 76	A fun photo booth portrait of a goofy and calm couple.
76	123 46 25 20 41 161 121 206 48 208 76	Uncle Fester dressed up as Darth Vader.
76	128 176 124 65 144 82 16 4 18 152 76	Best way to dine is in a restaurant just for yourself
76	140 92 163 106 124 117 21 17 97 190 76	This festival is groovy, dude.
76	154 196 70 161 31 68 9 172 22 125 76	let's go to sleep
76	5 97 127 60 199 131 20 135 193 178 76	I would love to just hike up this mountain and chill with my family.
76	123 35 20 154 215 105 190 94 157 8 76	I really love the scenery, where is this?
76	188 201 125 177 154 191 35 200 86 167 76	A very laidback moment
76	100 44 67 213 93 194 147 3 173 20 76	The beautiful butterfly in the background makes for a great photo of the two young ladies.
76	164 123 103 8 198 163 9 33 210 149 76	This guy looks like he knows what he's talking about.
76	6 145 86 176 180 133 98 186 151 160 76	You know in Japan, those types of toys and comics are more appreciated.
76	130 129 20 209 61 114 213 34 6 135 76	This is the kind of place I need to go on my next vacation, so full of life, this place looks interesting and fun
76	7 77 70 116 66 23 206 135 203 125 76	Look at this nice trail, I hope it leads somewhere nice.
76	101 121 123 33 119 188 132 199 11 43 76	This pipe needs to be fixed.
76	96 27 35 30 135 68 175 79 153 130 76	Welp, at least I'm on the beach!! Instead of in that room. Seems stressful and boring.
76	93 146 183 167 191 162 27 119 131 175 76	I love the chill vibe of this.
76	13 207 156 109 113 197 9 118 136 25 76	I wish I could sit up there and watch the world past by.  Wouldn't that be a wonderful day?
76	161 2 148 83 74 62 77 185 43 9 76	A quiet evening in the park.
76	157 41 50 170 12 70 144 47 168 160 76	What a relaxed lion I am. I love laying in the sun and napping.
76	106 164 16 158 94 35 136 8 102 21 76	Friendly's up ahead
76	54 5 42 150 172 197 201 63 128 181 76	It seems really cold out there.It is good to see the unity of people out there.
76	85 182 145 204 62 44 111 180 34 188 76	WATERFALLS ARE SO PEACEFUL
76	151 63 31 212 91 201 171 140 18 209 76	We don't need to go too fast
76	215 122 147 64 130 177 105 17 145 214 76	The family gathering was peaceful and pleasant.
76	49 109 27 80 204 95 123 85 211 155 76	Enjoying my meal
76	214 20 140 88 175 48 144 180 42 31 76	poetry by the bar
76	180 63 101 211 82 100 190 110 195 129 76	Must be the end of the meeting, everyone looks happy and ready to leave.
76	211 7 155 208 134 85 99 32 111 104 76	Women should wear what they want
76	127 66 173 149 159 157 202 152 24 183 76	It's nice to just chill out here.
76	20 180 137 30 190 95 132 24 86 33 76	Staring at this puts me in a sleepy frame of mind.
76	44 215 160 184 24 174 41 165 42 188 76	I could nap right now
76	27 83 167 90 125 43 1 78 65 84 76	The guys are waiting for the match to begin
76	14 91 139 49 207 126 58 47 149 83 76	Lets take a stroll around this courtyard and admire the sculpture.
76	97 113 9 69 105 131 23 78 146 81 76	The night was delightful.
76	178 187 73 37 24 162 199 176 54 213 76	Nice place to take a rest and do some meditation.
76	158 151 69 101 87 139 144 82 194 124 76	I love the ceiling, makes me feel like I"m in Rome

76	86 154 207 189 108 10 179 70 63 11 76	This bird is so free
76	95 74 153 183 82 21 9 189 215 101 76	It's almost time to land. It was a good flight.
76	137 150 163 20 182 61 201 170 16 18 76	A totally chill day at the museum for a family.  Cool.
76	186 65 209 75 63 98 212 74 112 62 76	I remember the days of flying Air China... ah...
76	82 106 105 99 27 66 151 212 201 119 76	at least i'm not last :)
76	142 118 8 140 120 139 95 128 72 32 76	This is so relaxing.

78	203 206 187 36 208 98 7 126 106 161 78	The flowers are blooming and are coming to life. Look at the sun in the background, it's just amazing!
78	103 180 98 75 107 72 115 165 108 192 78	This is very colorful and fun.
78	23 93 175 172 161 36 119 63 22 160 78	I bet it'd be great fun to ride along the conveyor belt. I bet I could jump off before I got hurt or anything. I hope they get to listen to music while they work there!
78	75 77 98 85 207 54 66 120 172 10 78	This is truly a moment in time. There will be so many reactions in just a split second after this picture was taken!

78	88 207 215 93 140 166 69 183 195 130 78	Getting real with a behind the scenes chat with the band
78	17 151 111 12 201 213 168 132 26 117 78	I would dress like that every day if I could
78	196 143 81 104 70 125 211 182 21 42 78	What a flip! this is the best flip I've ever seen!

78	209 150 212 104 141 127 72 97 62 30 78	I love old buildings!
78	193 152 53 58 103 188 212 31 5 159 78	The canyon behind this man looks like Bryce Canyon which I hiked last month!
78	114 58 97 193 50 139 202 184 108 14 78	This beautiful photo was taken in 2009
78	93 86 14 160 196 109 187 25 152 114 78	I love the juxtaposition of the sky against the land. I think the framing of this picture is just beautiful.
78	195 200 25 67 57 152 127 208 89 39 78	The sun going down is so enticing
78	136 122 47 178 167 154 33 108 153 174 78	Her hair color is really nice looking.
78	124 90 115 37 19 152 192 84 147 159 78	She is full of it.
78	57 32 52 101 210 193 197 29 135 64 78	What a beautiful mountain side! This is the type of place I could go to and take photos of the sea side along with the moon rise.
78	29 158 197 75 83 41 198 14 61 72 78	That man looks like he has a good time.
78	51 102 188 198 71 132 177 66 5 83 78	That's a great looking building.
78	185 197 109 83 4 41 156 128 87 184 78	Is this the light everyone sees when they pass on?
78	203 124 24 180 83 136 12 167 131 31 78	We sit and tell stories drink drinks and deepen our bonds of fellowship
78	98 80 26 81 36 189 103 101 151 34 78	Wow her unitard is like a beautiful serpent hanging on a branch of a tree limb!
78	170 132 101 199 182 153 3 52 81 121 78	I painted this during my meditation.
78	75 140 186 197 94 171 21 8 72 176 78	Traveling the world in a camper? Yes, please. Can't wait to begin my adventure.
78	200 195 123 116 58 39 135 11 19 164 78	This is just one of the most beautiful locations I have ever seen! I cannot get over how I can't take my eyes off of this picture.
78	203 157 64 50 37 190 77 31 126 3 78	Wow! The blue sky contrasts the red tower so beautifully!
78	113 121 28 137 95 132 173 107 184 63 78	So many different people all gathered in one place!
78	177 159 212 154 213 5 111 135 189 186 78	I just love the color purple!
78	67 215 187 89 92 83 135 109 179 121 78	So proud of the presentation today
78	57 37 67 43 39 157 101 155 123 195 78	It's time for head to head combat.
78	194 74 159 158 28 45 134 193 13 184 78	I love colors, they be the true meaning of relaxation.
78	51 142 183 117 59 149 52 102 16 71 78	This tree is crazy unique.
79	189 125 126 26 50 158 195 87 105 193 79	what if i picked all the petals off
79	195 213 89 135 57 64 35 26 185 106 79	Big hole in the sand
79	212 121 91 42 36 11 173 133 26 88 79	These walls are talking and the've got a LOT to say.
79	128 174 203 6 4 104 126 186 185 24 79	Practice makes perfect.
79	209 181 14 115 82 175 81 90 159 59 79	This is where the crime occured.
79	41 155 67 72 62 51 104 116 181 89 79	The bride does not seem to see these men.
79	127 139 144 87 28 5 42 147 12 41 79	The overlook isn't really overlooking anything.
79	136 126 205 144 178 21 16 215 181 11 79	He looks like my cult leader
79	176 67 208 12 4 16 107 124 137 198 79	This looks weird.
79	126 153 57 53 109 58 144 206 155 4 79	Why is it empty? It shouldn't be...
79	127 200 170 53 34 6 204 101 190 21 79	Motocycles are nice.
79	159 105 167 189 108 76 54 93 170 213 79	thats a biggg truck i would watch out for.
79	28 94 209 212 186 144 58 61 161 51 79	Such a weird creepy bottle.
79	7 186 134 210 131 129 5 137 66 132 79	It's a pizzeria that is pretty cool.
79	131 172 102 48 171 203 133 105 125 184 79	Do you see the reflection in the window? I see it as well.
79	197 165 154 73 155 58 44 91 195 68 79	It was a city like any other city, entirely in Black and White. I was a detective and I was going to find the colors.
79	140 170 206 131 176 4 80 188 195 74 79	Daily addictions come in all forms.
79	215 75 153 64 105 156 151 182 124 123 79	I'm the only one in the room that can connect with him through our souls
79	76 113 24 132 29 16 20 125 111 139 79	I know what she's looking at on that screen, but I'm not going to tell you.
79	17 103 108 73 54 38 192 84 142 117 79	Wonder what is going on ther?
79	13 165 141 177 106 28 86 207 14 32 79	I'm glad that the boys are still out there repping.
79	134 139 189 85 119 102 76 151 188 94 79	When the clouds touch the fields, the ravens will appear.
79	57 8 172 77 65 83 182 16 124 184 79	Is this freedom speech or a revolution?
79	96 33 207 121 153 142 110 177 131 8 79	that is a very blue sea
79	161 189 198 82 85 166 27 120 179 99 79	This is black and white picture but somehow it also looks very actual.
79	210 211 185 90 154 23 142 183 191 96 79	this is quite the residence - I wonder if it's a home, hotel or something else?
79	206 134 187 142 183 117 127 33 3 208 79	I wonder how to get there..
79	35 59 77 197 119 169 154 104 33 17 79	Where angels fear to tread.
79	2 83 189 143 150 14 39 5 145 190 79	Knew what it was minute I saw it
79	140 133 186 203 14 73 32 190 53 41 79	hmm this is weird
79	138 82 49 75 202 105 30 1 54 55 79	There is something missing from this photo
79	202 201 27 88 83 39 22 77 98 209 79	requesting prayers please for a personal matter.
79	19 64 105 55 178 198 130 98 162 140 79	not sure why someone would take this photo, for what purpose maybe to show traffic to their boss
79	83 169 197 61 9 128 101 40 45 10 79	Blue...Just a colour or representative of a mood?
79	144 191 185 195 36 182 93 115 183 147 79	FAMILY AND FRIENDS ARE THE BEST FOR HEALTH.
79	12 89 11 112 27 24 47 40 123 33 79	RAWR = really awkward with reality.
79	76 14 127 186 44 73 128 70 56 68 79	I had fun last night
79	87 5 97 170 140 141 196 188 112 108 79	ah yes quite Romaneqsue in nature
79	74 87 205 23 95 13 55 99 166 60 79	The  tree of life flows from them.
79	123 201 22 153 212 194 164 115 25 137 79	I wonder what he's thinking about.
79	24 204 189 85 132 151 178 137 205 190 79	I don't think you can hide in the flowers forever.
79	183 129 8 126 70 170 182 211 97 206 79	The nature is simply pretty.
79	32 96 154 172 162 115 21 67 17 36 79	Oh, I too remember my time spent in this pedestrian square.
79	44 64 111 201 53 24 87 212 71 92 79	this looks a little strange
79	68 125 181 146 71 21 195 142 175 212 79	Is that helicopter about to crash or is it taking off?
79	148 44 39 46 75 64 43 158 139 47 79	The question is...who is rescued who?
79	183 103 124 135 196 136 130 186 53 6 79	Ah, I can see exactly what thoughts the artist was intending to provoke with this work. Anyone else, or is it just me that understands it?
79	212 189 167 109 13 108 174 131 93 161 79	There can be another
79	202 209 1 28 27 112 143 205 127 109 79	Train cars, makes you wonder what is inside.
79	30 197 146 202 18 51 174 199 130 214 79	alien ledgent
79	130 188 95 14 185 115 144 197 45 60 79	The pack huddles as one
79	131 7 191 8 189 77 119 192 40 19 79	Hmm, the couple remind me of two people I used to know.
79	19 64 196 86 18 43 60 181 113 52 79	lines and lines and rows of row like always
79	101 113 73 197 68 50 124 175 67 65 79	There was an ominous message hidden within that bright purple exterior.
79	44 116 63 31 59 174 105 36 18 164 79	I bet they're all thinking, does the line ever end?
79	211 61 139 183 72 78 180 214 76 127 79	he should draw his shadow with chalk
79	154 119 164 96 2 125 175 34 82 110 79	Are we ready to do this?
79	192 12 127 195 98 167 64 38 117 145 79	The color of this bug is bland.
79	182 114 34 142 64 139 168 92 181 198 79	If you only knew what this actually means...
79	61 188 126 104 142 103 154 25 12 85 79	Not everyone will understand.
79	20 38 13 153 54 48 142 136 37 105 79	they're probably talking about something we don't need to know.
79	112 212 54 81 106 189 57 3 39 126 79	The kid is running very fast.
79	209 150 162 60 93 39 210 74 188 65 79	Water, people in boats, one man turned the opposite direction, one green man.
79	173 40 36 187 179 88 45 166 144 131 79	You can see your future in the crystal bowl, your future is yellow
79	206 171 170 163 2 99 75 43 38 90 79	That man is probably riding a bike in a park, or he is on a mountain side, or he is on his way home for work.
79	208 121 49 51 31 135 160 206 166 73 79	Real or fake?
79	176 45 142 78 4 155 202 172 32 36 79	This girl looks obtuse.
79	172 149 17 43 30 169 110 101 126 78 79	im not really feeling this dress
79	12 48 187 38 122 204 68 115 185 206 79	I wonder if he is the cause for what's going to happen later today
79	135 54 14 165 123 34 196 26 136 46 79	In a lonely alleyway, there is a certain wall lined with random photos. No one really knows who put them there or for what reason. They just appear, one photo at a time as the days go by.
79	87 131 10 142 14 144 72 64 98 137 79	Maybe she should step in between the bromance.
79	71 31 160 190 103 39 102 149 170 135 79	The tiny stamens remind us of the beaks of tiny birds.
79	107 21 98 125 51 140 76 153 187 192 79	This type of flower reminds me of somthing that I'd rather not talk about.
79	90 169 21 149 73 59 64 119 92 105 79	I wonder what the scene is depicting.
79	30 48 92 75 26 102 3 49 212 52 79	Perhaps the video footage contains a secret message
79	139 5 25 120 11 45 72 144 96 13 79	See that guy in the gray jacket and hat in the background? Yep...
79	23 124 166 152 209 195 67 155 91 176 79	I can't decide.
79	205 65 94 46 164 83 184 122 208 188 79	The blue color may or may not have been reflective of my mood.
79	11 131 194 100 167 13 207 124 134 80 79	If the city of Tucson is bringing back horse and carriage,what does that mean for what is to come?
79	81 34 28 76 175 107 55 103 50 90 79	Pick a card any card.
79	32 139 164 162 45 152 144 85 52 102 79	Not exactly the first creative use of a parallelogram in modern societal code...
79	17 121 137 7 122 28 86 91 175 33 79	Paul Revere needs to ride again.
79	156 126 187 128 51 49 112 183 190 13 79	He played like a prodigy, and had never had a lesson in his life.
79	214 153 54 100 67 203 57 159 114 156 79	I will hail and salute you, fearless leader.
79	11 150 123 134 215 17 35 139 194 100 79	I know where this location is - do you?
79	7 72 54 32 100 75 67 127 137 171 79	Are we the birds, is 2 in the hand better than one on the stump?
79	205 26 83 105 93 80 60 86 112 46 79	So many children have gone missing from playgrounds in front of people that it has become enigmatic how these children are able to disappear right in broad day light.
79	162 117 196 63 211 203 97 138 67 11 79	bleak, normal, bland
79	49 143 139 212 37 123 211 161 68 84 79	We all know whats going to happen to these two now :D
79	69 41 176 50 158 57 130 51 77 184 79	How are they going to get across those logs?
79	74 114 146 136 168 99 207 215 20 76 79	You would never guess the temperature of this place.
79	203 159 28 60 195 22 180 75 208 164 79	Am I looking in or is someone else looking out?
79	61 139 7 181 197 203 106 24 9 198 79	Could it be a snail? Or a loaf of bread?
79	206 197 137 72 43 104 74 208 150 181 79	Those colors look crazy.
79	48 53 42 164 84 56 4 117 211 171 79	I entered the code and deactivated the device
80	54 152 123 91 203 166 76 5 105 178 80	Can i be buried with them?
80	157 183 201 198 118 162 1 215 139 34 80	He looks like my old buddy from school. He still has the shirt he stole from me.
80	8 75 95 98 153 199 193 52 147 162 80	Building a deck has never been so much fun.
80	170 108 127 57 46 77 161 189 186 203 80	I wouldn't mind a turn on that guitar
80	12 74 15 173 19 178 17 36 121 167 80	i like in this peach
80	95 149 69 203 42 46 192 101 131 41 80	Poster is ready come and watch
80	96 39 137 184 155 113 101 50 173 60 80	That blouse is so cute I might just take it for myself!

81	199 195 86 49 39 109 110 134 154 111 81	Remember that your mother always knows best

81	45 10 74 68 61 142 157 51 32 86 81	Clever looking piece of machinery
81	118 207 122 198 195 170 69 210 189 128 81	The young lady on the left looks very enlightened in her thoughts.
81	75 214 212 47 137 128 12 94 58 171 81	One should pause and contemplate when viewing such a calming color.
81	45 189 133 148 94 51 24 123 183 53 81	Live music is always more than the sum of its melodic lyrics
81	49 22 185 36 214 213 19 7 97 149 81	This pic reminds of me elders discussing grand things back in the day. I miss when elders were respected.
81	168 63 5 162 107 172 61 23 154 99 81	Teens must learn to fend for themselves eventually.
81	132 25 87 74 77 84 48 59 144 26 81	It is never comfortable feeling or seeming like a third wheel. In reality, or in a photo.
81	94 37 15 169 64 40 187 126 41 34 81	Ah, I remember my first dog
81	140 194 202 54 57 41 187 195 109 134 81	That motorcycle gets 50 miles to the gallon.
81	88 20 150 52 66 124 97 14 197 51 81	Imagine how many millions of years it took to form those rock layers
81	71 169 204 12 207 128 188 130 78 151 81	I would certainly come here to contemplate my place in this universe, it looks to provide much needed solitude.
81	63 85 51 174 64 113 68 180 155 7 81	It can truly help one's perspective to take time to look at an image like this, to realize the beauty of the color itself.
81	127 90 196 172 24 126 161 5 168 82 81	A long road to travel
81	12 196 83 17 26 98 41 3 72 38 81	I see a wise old man sitting here when he can.
81	39 197 201 110 154 213 56 164 109 32 81	What not to get caught doing at work.

81	149 6 195 87 184 26 150 161 155 135 81	Though the exhibit may look dull, this is a fascinating piece of history technically.
81	48 3 133 141 155 183 94 65 79 69 81	This colour is looks feminie
81	178 189 97 17 127 40 51 56 152 9 81	Great to see the young abiding by helmet rules.
81	153 154 122 144 28 54 85 126 213 142 81	Drink five glasses a day, keep the doctor away!
81	36 94 171 157 162 152 166 154 136 173 81	She picked an excellent costume to juxtapose her most striking features and pulls it off well, the confidence she gains from this will last long after the costume is gone.
81	186 151 166 49 202 169 153 24 18 126 81	That bunny looks calm.
81	205 76 164 91 161 88 143 156 28 24 81	I can't beleive you have been together for that old
81	167 176 1 16 150 172 165 206 88 192 81	You shouldn't swim in there.
81	215 20 186 36 94 188 191 71 3 53 81	What a nice stretch of road.
81	186 128 168 180 17 167 164 210 146 4 81	Well, that is a lot of lights!
81	197 138 20 39 46 160 99 55 176 175 81	He will speed better if he lean forward
82	150 51 7 179 102 176 80 165 61 11 82	I want someone to run around this field with me but I'm too afraid to ask.
82	6 30 62 27 77 10 190 138 185 55 82	I don't like to talk to strangers even when they are trying to show me something interesting.
82	68 122 102 169 99 157 173 45 32 184 82	Nice collection I would say.
82	149 162 76 181 118 163 5 167 44 79 82	I am not sure I could live here.
82	111 151 194 201 135 24 9 212 152 8 82	I prefer to be surrounded by animals, because humans scare me
82	80 160 115 171 106 154 94 156 166 78 82	I want to collect the eggs but im scared
82	45 179 185 88 111 97 18 116 77 92 82	Its hard to approach people as a nerd
82	53 9 92 45 100 127 93 178 84 7 82	id be afraid to compete
82	5 186 1 215 96 135 64 194 63 180 82	I would ask where that is, to maybe see it one day.
82	66 126 155 64 46 101 111 162 108 15 82	I'd like to sit out here alone and play with these flowers.
82	54 59 22 185 174 214 176 132 58 50 82	I could never participate in sports, I was always too scared.
82	193 89 134 211 55 6 43 84 65 179 82	it looks like the flower blushes at the bee's touch
82	214 57 29 210 155 113 18 34 65 1 82	I don't want to talk to them.
82	204 131 155 191 97 28 96 16 15 18 82	I'd hate to be in the spotlight like that.
82	33 77 135 20 47 101 177 25 11 205 82	I don't know what I'd do if I saw a woman like this
82	112 115 189 106 57 149 135 210 121 163 82	I wouldn't dare play baseball. I might get hit
82	23 12 185 11 43 60 173 49 134 121 82	I wish I could talk to girls who look like that
82	124 118 3 98 74 8 62 127 175 31 82	I'm too scared to pet this little guy.
82	144 198 186 169 136 99 61 150 158 7 82	I want to go but it looks so crowded
82	72 69 157 171 201 172 19 58 8 21 82	what phone is that if you don't mind me asking
82	168 65 126 114 24 153 95 34 116 193 82	I wouldn't want someone to walk in on me while I sleep in this.
82	63 46 50 183 15 11 197 104 34 93 82	That shirt of his is interesting and I like it, but I don't know how to tell him that.
82	126 158 118 129 39 22 46 69 15 2 82	She seems to not wanna be bothered.
82	163 110 93 103 105 195 177 64 27 100 82	It would be so nice to live out here, far away from the city and noise.
82	76 59 3 36 104 125 47 19 145 182 82	That duck is kind of cute.
82	73 189 163 46 14 132 92 110 52 63 82	It must be really scary performing on stage like that.
82	89 7 59 113 94 203 116 190 80 57 82	I want to hide behind those flowers.
82	30 11 180 165 181 105 71 188 197 214 82	This looks nice
82	2 171 131 130 106 123 125 153 13 154 82	You must be respectful while in a church.
82	203 198 167 121 100 9 67 170 81 69 82	Aww...Look at the little guy! He looks so quiet and shy.
82	72 7 13 51 206 185 136 74 70 25 82	I don't know how to talk to a baby.
82	198 11 89 167 163 111 142 187 102 159 82	May I please have a peach?
82	195 15 121 86 55 161 116 40 215 97 82	The drink tasted like liquid corn, and I didn't want to drink it, but was nervous about expressing these thoughts.
82	157 209 200 31 123 109 132 186 11 78 82	That looks like a perfect place for me to study
82	5 54 9 191 36 135 42 123 39 178 82	I dont know if I could trust him
82	85 50 31 99 78 149 4 193 166 86 82	He looks like a sweet little creature but I don't want to disturb him!
82	54 154 45 204 43 122 213 48 201 209 82	Your lens is cool, you are great.
82	212 133 70 179 31 127 18 86 22 54 82	I haven't been on a boat. I wouldn't want to go alone.
82	158 68 161 81 130 59 72 37 47 54 82	[TIMEOUT]
82	32 30 196 90 127 42 207 185 27 118 82	I would never be brave enough to drive a red car, they are too noticable!
82	15 157 4 46 215 75 34 90 40 22 82	Scared to show  your face?  Dont be that way.
82	180 19 53 116 4 58 104 56 85 175 82	i wouldn't be able to talk in a group like this man.
82	51 70 124 205 41 94 174 195 163 184 82	I wish I was outside, away from the people and the noise.
82	146 110 106 170 35 163 152 67 4 88 82	I am a little loss for words.
82	189 123 38 172 158 195 56 108 165 125 82	What a nice looking guy.
82	190 151 174 46 159 7 21 104 76 131 82	I would not like being in the middle of that crowd of people.
82	12 50 124 130 45 63 162 93 125 8 82	I am too scared to touch this thing or swim by it in a reef!
82	127 62 146 183 43 91 85 182 113 207 82	i wish i had the courage to go out in public like this
82	182 174 128 201 70 135 192 141 26 143 82	No one seemed to talk to one another.
82	91 145 95 28 65 177 76 32 199 140 82	introverted, tortured, drained
82	127 143 190 17 77 131 62 136 18 35 82	I would like to own this but I'm worried it would bring too much attention to me.
82	174 171 114 90 19 106 204 173 102 117 82	That's a strange group together.
82	71 148 79 52 106 200 158 204 20 133 82	Aww I wish I could pet him, but I wont I will stay back
82	124 17 93 128 176 75 193 139 123 144 82	I am afraid to go over and talk
82	199 65 135 144 208 158 110 88 23 166 82	Hope he had a nice time.
82	196 160 68 185 154 3 134 187 100 59 82	I don't feel comfortable going into this bar.
82	148 190 66 187 96 186 29 95 45 36 82	I could see being shy while out on the bridge.
82	24 123 106 153 13 212 77 68 157 11 82	The bright lights make me want to slink away for the spotlight.
82	118 139 112 117 20 191 13 88 105 91 82	He was so soft spoken.
82	121 189 147 27 91 37 98 68 194 20 82	I hope he kisses me
82	181 29 169 146 162 16 9 212 35 60 82	the mere mention of closed circuit X-Ray
82	42 30 129 37 123 1 71 69 199 169 82	I wish i can make a move like that
82	186 67 57 128 172 209 73 144 3 206 82	Babies make me nervous
82	27 182 132 52 113 17 139 213 95 18 82	I don't know how I feel about this. It's just the color purple. There is no other color.
82	39 213 152 176 55 6 97 149 204 109 82	I am going to pass out when I meet him!
82	59 162 38 114 156 215 128 92 48 203 82	Oh wow, I'd be so shy in front of such a strong woman.
82	200 148 100 7 40 95 97 165 67 52 82	This is how i look sometimes
82	145 150 75 91 17 5 26 182 55 187 82	I cant look at the road
82	111 178 138 158 170 171 61 79 36 73 82	I wouldn't want to have my picture taken with this camera.
82	103 57 26 104 44 65 139 31 52 87 82	This looks like  a very quiet spot.
82	161 12 70 50 165 69 114 23 17 100 82	I'll keep it to myself
82	102 208 69 193 68 139 195 177 161 71 82	what a beautiful lighting view of a tower
82	9 20 199 203 93 102 163 44 90 133 82	I like those pants but would be worried I would look weird in them
82	183 129 95 52 47 3 106 159 68 79 82	They was not shy with that color scheme
82	112 151 153 94 44 32 53 184 23 71 82	I love to ride but I don't think I would be bold enough to do that in front of a crowd.
82	106 156 2 74 101 44 27 177 57 176 82	that man looks scary
82	146 114 124 179 70 50 86 212 97 203 82	If he looks up, he'll see me.  I better move towards the back row.
82	165 139 30 67 116 188 145 90 186 184 82	I wouldn't want to buy strings there. He seems nice, but what if he thinks I'm dumb for asking?
82	208 61 87 26 152 45 11 20 106 158 82	It was the mos beautiful car I'd ever seen, but that made me too nervous to approach or even drive it.
82	110 96 145 171 31 27 181 131 196 48 82	He re we can see  a lady drinking and the man is watching it.
82	39 87 16 93 38 109 201 21 172 71 82	The snow never feel good
82	110 172 198 73 179 37 2 92 80 182 82	I am in a place where no one can find me.
82	2 143 93 171 164 92 43 160 42 54 82	I want to look through these binoculars but I don't want to ask for permission.
82	145 73 63 92 108 184 211 104 84 16 82	This looks like a nice corner to settle in and get away from the crowd.
82	67 195 54 121 106 74 84 1 141 55 82	I don't think I wanna go on the other side of that fence! looks scary.
82	136 155 164 183 7 204 41 89 29 15 82	I am too timid to ask for a clean spoon.
82	20 63 48 142 26 29 181 69 12 173 82	It looks nice, but the height is intimidating.
82	199 3 117 10 73 21 200 130 88 92 82	I'm not so sure I would talk to this guy.
82	110 67 58 38 150 113 203 74 85 128 82	The president of the University of Missouri is introverted but still makes attempts to raise money.
82	141 142 139 12 30 205 169 198 200 172 82	If I climb those trees, I won't have to speak to anyone today.
82	206 124 150 109 166 121 28 101 29 37 82	So dangerous but im too shy to say anything
82	48 67 182 94 207 165 142 17 69 45 82	I would hate to post on that board
82	81 90 125 91 77 121 36 128 54 126 82	I want to sit away from everyone.
82	129 96 123 114 100 20 39 167 44 88 82	Heh... Bridges are nice... I like the water view.
82	131 83 58 78 75 200 212 176 9 185 82	No way I could go up and talk to her
83	177 82 94 51 26 63 175 166 39 47 83	This is going to look so neat. I love it
83	15 96 205 93 106 211 198 189 89 58 83	I could only imagine the sweat and fresh smell of these beautiful flowers.
83	105 148 127 159 59 31 195 33 74 117 83	I've always wanted to have a romantic candlelight dinner in an abandoned warehouse.
83	134 165 126 109 120 15 110 210 95 28 83	mmmm give me that mcdonalds haha
83	131 43 129 110 31 199 124 179 88 80 83	Oh I could picture myself right there with him, holding me, pressing his body against mine and keeping me warm.
83	64 117 133 126 177 101 175 25 157 189 83	Great place to relax with your loved one
83	73 8 186 164 7 160 171 60 207 185 83	They all see proud of themselves.
83	107 174 133 45 127 122 71 145 90 181 83	I hate to say, those windmills are probably killing the mood for that poor couple.
83	212 120 29 56 194 188 67 211 152 6 83	Feel the green seep between your toes, feel the green slide down your face. Feel the green.
83	77 64 171 162 152 149 168 191 144 72 83	His girlfriend is waiting for him.
83	206 71 16 148 34 108 118 151 109 166 83	I am very relaxed.
83	116 109 96 208 142 141 68 30 104 138 83	Sleek planes, with high powered emissions.
83	63 42 75 56 111 54 61 37 118 158 83	I love seeing handsome men and beautiful women on stage.
83	70 194 145 137 126 146 24 120 46 6 83	She looks really mysterious....
83	147 163 144 120 46 149 139 51 110 152 83	That woman is so beautiful, I would love to take her on a romantic date.
83	214 105 49 45 106 140 34 208 17 129 83	This girl looks cute stretched out like that reaching for the ball.
83	41 210 57 66 95 214 14 172 89 58 83	What a luscious flowing meadow with such beautiful wetland.

83	138 211 35 160 140 134 187 183 97 180 83	That bird is something I love.
83	107 193 32 215 155 196 47 183 181 13 83	Long and lazy line

83	9 169 160 75 175 89 117 85 96 130 83	I wonder what those feel like. Smooth, or textured?
83	93 121 13 145 24 154 94 61 19 199 83	The freshly cut grass provides an arousing smell.
83	147 142 52 206 16 134 1 61 160 110 83	This moment is so special.
83	73 131 39 171 33 91 18 106 202 157 83	A quiet walk through the forest and a tranquil pond. A nice sight to see to relax.

83	54 63 92 166 195 158 191 117 179 32 83	The heat and humidity make everyone here so languid and thirsty for sensation.
83	86 175 212 114 74 177 46 184 25 23 83	I like how the people in this pict

84	75 156 165 194 26 69 13 166 61 201 84	Art balloons, and they are signed by the artist. A real collectors item that could go up in value.
84	178 79 186 169 30 63 174 24 120 183 84	This gathering looks momentous and celebratory.
84	53 18 199 207 100 212 46 143 29 168 84	This is a pleasant siting areas in a nice part of town.

84	55 192 65 124 130 58 145 144 168 90 84	I wonder what the pH level is here.
84	176 125 39 105 102 20 75 87 72 5 84	I've had these grapes before.  They are better suited for wine.
84	160 130 167 97 46 202 10 68 107 58 84	I'm not sure I could go outside in that outfit without feeling embarrassed.

84	50 129 6 2 212 145 88 167 104 202 84	Purple is an elegant color, perfect for silks!
84	69 108 93 11 45 133 147 207 117 121 84	This porticullus is decended for defense of the structure. The iron used has high content of materials that are the same used in my driveway's gate. I imported this gate for my guesthouse.
84	76 39 78 86 71 90 56 92 157 125 84	These boats are small, sure, but when you consider the logistics of bringing yachts out here, you'll understand why the smart people stick to these smaller boats.

84	21 115 97 138 192 36 40 8 110 39 84	what professional people!
84	59 97 201 60 65 185 108 74 103 14 84	This would make a lovely painting that would show well in a gallery.
84	121 88 170 149 143 70 173 39 205 134 84	What a plethora of people waiting in line.
84	116 123 59 127 189 204 180 52 199 16 84	Studious looking bunch
84	74 31 80 160 182 188 161 56 204 175 84	Hmm can't see myself water is to murky.

84	204 3 34 33 40 35 14 86 90 186 84	Ah, Mark Twain once commented that the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in San Francisco. The chill of the morning fog creeping in and enveloping the Golden Gate Bridge, the icy green Bay waters... reminders of how solitary life in the city can be.
84	44 136 128 100 15 97 78 104 35 82 84	The bird is trying to lay an egg
84	185 39 179 58 212 60 130 122 171 92 84	I can see this book is smart.

84	72 214 158 205 100 80 2 81 11 40 84	It appears as if the rail was not anchored correctly
84	100 107 149 131 114 135 204 47 163 189 84	A lone tree in the field is the eternal winner.
84	186 140 102 129 38 72 203 181 111 10 84	This is perfectly lovely and goes well with a nice dinner and glass of expensive wine
84	21 8 72 162 30 125 107 41 44 73 84	This animal sits it in cut waiting for any chances
84	100 126 183 76 80 87 16 211 177 10 84	This young gentlemen seems to be in need of a shirt...
84	137 72 96 205 163 74 51 42 173 114 84	The televisions have just the right style for a beautiful room. Thankfully they are the right size for viewing well.
84	114 30 22 43 78 160 25 77 196 123 84	This expansive patch of space is cocoa-colored.

84	16 152 210 25 180 44 98 204 165 107 84	Those glasses are totally last season.
84	22 97 125 178 131 168 95 123 12 126 84	I once completed a painting that looked very similar to this scene.
84	41 47 124 180 191 95 7 58 83 9 84	What a lovely quality the light has.
84	171 130 82 142 145 89 205 15 56 106 84	The placement, colors, and the set up were done in such a classy way that the bright colors came off well.
84	75 53 71 43 61 91 128 164 199 167 84	This building looks very sophisticated.
84	151 210 204 203 112 54 74 91 183 76 84	The water looks clean enough for me.
84	93 207 99 137 210 38 105 97 108 155 84	This is how people dressed in the time of Robin Hood and his merry men.
84	207 193 63 22 104 190 132 15 196 154 84	Japanese anime is becoming very popular in the United States. I cannot imagine this being true in any other era.
84	4 206 124 55 47 77 168 157 184 179 84	That would make a strunning centerpiece in the study. On the feature wall.
84	86 90 170 57 182 137 83 55 30 203 84	He is really looking amazing in that fancy outfit
84	44 129 3 166 40 150 185 176 135 64 84	I am erudite and happen to know those birds are most likely Puffins.
84	48 105 73 101 85 32 98 70 208 133 84	I'm not quite sure whether the individual is the little girl's parent, but she looks like a great little girl.
84	66 123 159 83 174 121 99 130 102 51 84	I only buy polished pearl string tighteners.
84	88 70 65 130 5 37 149 13 6 157 84	I'll bet that metal is top grade silver.
84	111 31 92 190 174 178 99 133 60 26 84	I like to dress up when I go to the car show.
84	196 109 210 67 61 205 167 46 81 209 84	I researched squirrels a lot in college and that is one healthy squirrell
84	61 147 16 29 162 179 30 47 83 202 84	These tunnels remind me of a museum I once had a dinner at.
84	134 201 34 143 30 179 131 7 99 203 84	This is quite a nice concerto
84	16 54 95 101 46 65 108 60 104 53 84	What an astonishing view.
84	78 87 189 47 135 207 56 42 145 148 84	They need to decorate their room more; what a bore.
84	206 25 125 28 208 98 56 192 147 127 84	This bush looks like it knows something I don't...it looks like its smart about everything in the world.
84	103 148 86 197 187 115 42 205 91 177 84	I knew I was sophisticated it just took others to realize it.
84	71 60 185 21 83 142 70 150 106 151 84	History films were highly more cerebral when filmed in black and white
84	24 2 168 195 9 188 47 54 75 87 84	Please remove all the weeds.
84	137 194 88 214 92 180 106 122 155 149 84	What a gorgeous setting for an elegant outdoor affair.
84	167 111 152 125 144 127 76 162 198 133 84	I really like the outfit they chose for the kid here.
84	141 38 202 22 108 40 80 195 91 143 84	I can see she is intense here.
84	30 185 175 186 184 47 150 22 102 105 84	Laptops out, ready to start the day!
85	75 116 12 166 51 38 167 35 130 8 85	Oh me, I put all these in my homemade icr-creams this is going to be good, I hope it doesn't make anyone sick. :)
85	121 173 19 134 21 6 83 119 176 1 85	Yikes! I do not like heights!!
85	148 67 142 196 41 179 12 125 166 31 85	I wonder where the rest of the family is?  Hopefully nothing bad has happened.
85	167 100 159 196 61 118 176 66 130 179 85	I hate to see them play the wrong chord.
85	166 79 210 140 56 142 195 7 148 155 85	The concert better be sold out or money will be lost.
85	66 163 84 55 76 116 44 204 42 111 85	Hope that giant brick wall doesn't fall over on anyone.
85	76 161 137 45 98 135 43 84 112 77 85	Can't believe I'm late for this date..well at least I took the scenic route
85	114 144 39 74 160 109 3 150 110 148 85	What is this animal? It looks like it could be dangerous.
85	101 159 142 158 2 151 200 22 41 181 85	Thought this would be a great idea...til I saw my ex and her new man at the party
85	155 86 96 204 6 188 110 108 129 71 85	I could never stand on those rocks without panicking!
85	5 140 154 9 29 123 125 121 190 88 85	Those leaves are going to die and winter will be here soon.
85	172 39 48 154 31 96 174 30 9 26 85	I hope the airplane doesn't crash.
85	22 6 3 90 200 159 150 131 15 58 85	Okay that's actually creeping me out!!
85	56 174 156 110 143 124 101 13 38 200 85	I don't like boats, they make me sick
85	213 22 41 42 44 151 198 123 21 133 85	She's waiting for someone hope she's ok.
85	23 154 207 203 37 84 111 119 213 20 85	When will this be over.
85	75 50 46 27 112 153 195 30 90 72 85	The month is over and i can't wait to travel and see the blue skies
85	115 88 14 197 86 114 1 64 111 202 85	I really worry about a car coming around that curve too fast.
85	18 213 159 190 95 151 150 214 138 77 85	Jeez...it looks like he's about to fall over, doesn't it? One wrong move and his left knee is done for!
85	25 89 73 114 104 1 154 112 111 194 85	Oh god, this doll's eyes make me nervous! She's so creepy!
85	148 98 80 146 93 26 83 160 127 204 85	I bet there is tons of dangerous bacteria in that flower.
85	71 117 155 65 215 121 209 110 190 18 85	Can't wait for things to change around here.
85	186 137 199 33 133 79 196 161 174 24 85	I hate to wear open toed shoes in public, I feel like everyone is staring at my feet.
85	102 169 53 202 29 105 86 34 42 150 85	I wonder who's going to win. The guy in front looks like he's getting tired!
85	201 17 3 48 15 205 126 34 159 49 85	Seeing a man with out a shirt on makes me nervous.
85	64 54 55 20 39 196 3 151 21 213 85	Hurry up already I want to see the rocket lift off.
85	118 145 138 34 48 203 197 50 159 139 85	Too many people for my comfort.
85	74 4 34 78 130 207 58 28 120 185 85	What an intimidating looking building.
85	30 113 143 187 164 122 57 32 2 178 85	I have really bad allergies, I will not be going here.
85	71 161 215 27 111 139 9 18 80 99 85	What if that bird flies away?
85	79 16 133 142 109 73 151 103 1 188 85	I do not like this many people around me at all.
85	133 39 183 150 4 204 119 124 23 41 85	I hate heights, but I hate deep water even more.
85	65 80 143 213 92 41 93 168 103 164 85	be careful young man
85	157 18 54 52 109 87 31 35 192 136 85	Is that thing giving birth to something?
85	119 149 87 170 115 214 204 68 111 89 85	friendly meeting end with great thing
85	12 131 52 125 87 187 206 198 212 39 85	I would be anxious dressed like that.
85	6 57 33 124 204 129 120 82 152 186 85	This homeless man makes me nervous.
85	76 199 171 139 11 89 140 197 134 23 85	is this s piece of UFO equipment?
85	90 46 200 164 32 91 30 208 199 140 85	What does this mean? What does this mean? Is it swear words?
85	149 186 113 69 42 106 83 82 215 40 85	I can't calm down thinking how much work she's gone through to get there.
85	6 124 37 204 93 91 201 19 54 76 85	I really hope he does better in the race today.
85	147 51 154 50 153 74 84 47 187 155 85	That bird looks up to no good.
85	173 84 194 91 132 161 136 137 121 183 85	What if there are spiders in the lawn?
85	146 137 117 100 135 38 114 116 28 44 85	I hope she's not going to drink that
85	109 173 61 86 51 127 78 131 183 112 85	Trusting someone with your body in dancing is really hard for me, gotta work on my people skills...
85	14 172 72 63 36 187 189 99 133 26 85	That overhead doesn't look very stable. I wouldn't walk under it, you never know when it's going to fall!
85	160 146 165 182 8 140 89 24 91 107 85	I am afraid of this
85	81 154 213 64 74 168 126 24 112 82 85	i dont have time for all of this
85	203 33 6 2 149 155 75 182 34 205 85	I'm so ready to get on the slopes.
85	106 47 90 86 59 135 94 110 15 146 85	I hope there isn't a storm over those mountains.
85	139 205 189 120 117 8 198 156 55 35 85	I really hope he does not trip, oh no just the thought I can not look.
85	144 125 107 163 175 51 94 131 102 165 85	This place look overwhelming !
85	98 175 62 50 79 16 203 73 157 195 85	How do the two photos relate?
85	139 161 106 96 43 102 39 135 213 37 85	Hoping that carpet is clean, you never know what germs a baby can run into in their day to day activities.
85	15 179 55 196 106 147 123 126 194 105 85	I'm worried this baby will eat the papers.
85	77 213 153 69 39 29 175 101 75 57 85	I believe that we might need to go.. There's anything more to it than that we need to go we need to go
85	135 184 128 194 69 139 17 51 67 80 85	these kids make me weary
85	8 173 21 97 118 125 66 116 82 109 85	There's no way I could watch something like that. I'd be so afraid that he'll hurt himself or, worse, me!
85	67 77 138 152 12 176 194 112 196 155 85	Down to the wire...hope he makes the shot.
85	83 10 172 78 193 160 175 196 43 8 85	this dirty water is making me anxious
85	198 66 104 24 185 183 130 191 111 192 85	I must go buy a new record now!
85	175 155 201 131 80 116 191 107 102 36 85	The squirrel is alone, and doesn't know what will happen next.
85	30 12 104 88 62 129 51 148 119 138 85	I wonder if it is time to leave yet
85	108 214 26 187 210 110 213 195 143 103 85	I hate playing sports and waiting for something to come to me.
85	69 65 205 54 41 122 160 63 186 171 85	is she looking at me? she better not be looking at me.
85	171 129 148 112 20 136 102 215 149 182 85	This boulder is going to break apart and destroy everything it comes in contact with.
85	213 158 119 113 127 58 38 72 47 71 85	Left at the corner, down the street three blocks, I might make it to work on time.
85	178 54 23 125 173 180 194 61 146 191 85	I'm too scared to walk on that.
85	176 105 143 25 90 139 19 65 28 123 85	I am allergic to cats.
85	193 150 185 59 165 84 207 136 56 6 85	These runners could fall if they are too close together.
85	211 33 30 168 152 163 162 169 156 23 85	I think that building is a little bit to white, and has too many windows.
85	80 47 133 107 138 2 105 168 158 155 85	I think those people are up to something!
85	124 117 38 54 69 75 82 111 102 8 85	I wonder if everything is going according to plan.
85	103 40 118 102 119 112 121 3 71 180 85	i am nervous to think
85	170 142 188 162 182 16 45 94 197 135 85	This just looks like trouble waiting to happen. What's with the towels?
85	159 18 188 162 10 148 56 48 29 170 85	Oh no, I always get so worried about being bitten by a dog.
85	40 116 159 152 145 192 30 147 84 121 85	I would fall out if I ever met them face to face!
85	71 44 203 9 160 48 147 165 56 167 85	I could never perform like that
85	175 199 163 42 82 77 149 11 167 99 85	They look like a great band, but I worry they'll play too loud.
85	34 49 20 162 106 90 153 114 16 104 85	I hope she does not get hurt on that bridge
85	204 110 97 59 207 188 156 172 53 134 85	This picture makes me so nervous!  So hard to get everything done!
85	143 3 106 183 159 41 210 35 109 211 85	oh no i can't handle it
85	170 30 82 154 195 7 87 205 213 135 85	nature picture good one
85	135 65 158 121 166 60 169 141 79 49 85	Beaches make me nervous. I dont like the water
85	90 213 34 211 8 118 12 6 14 74 85	Somewhere i will like to visit
85	154 170 11 45 152 82 159 151 89 186 85	I am ready to go play!
85	189 171 116 25 207 30 27 36 10 138 85	Oh oh! I have high heels on!
85	129 102 130 180 176 194 83 132 32 210 85	the snow is so deep
85	22 44 3 67 8 110 86 32 108 165 85	That ceiling looks very priceless.
85	113 114 200 95 15 71 7 124 175 64 85	the noise from fireworks makes me on edge
85	78 24 60 71 196 94 214 47 180 116 85	I want to get under the leaf
85	56 185 151 36 108 204 58 34 167 183 85	What if he doesn't like the book?
85	92 120 48 144 105 197 170 55 23 57 85	I wonder if that bell rings really loud.  I don't like loud noises!
85	50 20 15 193 86 197 194 73 99 196 85	I  love to know their mother
85	215 174 193 40 109 113 179 130 155 139 85	I really want to know what the end product is
86	35 186 128 100 16 130 34 131 205 49 86	The structure of this car is quite elegant.
86	64 181 67 183 138 105 193 80 60 35 86	I like to use aloe vera from this plant to moisturize before I put on my tuxedo.
86	120 156 119 111 206 108 17 98 189 194 86	I do not know if cats should eat human food.
86	177 149 194 19 35 204 67 105 117 193 86	The winner of this game deserves respect from their peers.
86	117 84 139 58 59 176 194 48 23 49 86	Excuse me sir I believe you've committed a penalty and must be punished.
86	199 55 152 20 118 30 141 10 164 8 86	The wedding planner is reviewing ideas for the gala ball.
86	192 140 119 161 44 56 30 28 39 65 86	Could someone explain what I am looking at here? is it an empty field?
86	130 102 8 156 46 160 98 129 83 117 86	Is this a map?
86	81 103 140 46 160 148 6 29 48 125 86	The beautiful Venice
86	161 60 100 210 202 205 48 82 95 136 86	He should tuck his shirt in.
86	134 17 129 170 125 176 116 109 92 46 86	The soccer match is about to start.
86	8 128 85 205 16 31 182 77 131 62 86	This looks like Dover in Britain. It would be land owned by the crown then.
86	200 149 131 70 116 146 156 199 28 157 86	The gentleman is giving a speech,.
86	170 52 179 103 54 138 70 49 99 130 86	The bird's keep their distances from competition.
86	60 24 194 161 162 184 151 153 127 198 86	I believe these fine gentlemen are very well dressed.
86	104 17 99 61 141 196 181 24 30 155 86	That is such a beautiful tree.
86	49 172 129 190 177 34 206 204 52 27 86	I wouldn't wear that to the summer formal.
86	116 163 114 43 113 68 189 12 111 84 86	That looks like it's some kind of wasp with a long ovipositor. It's a really nice photo.
86	89 99 202 121 57 72 28 1 150 105 86	I really love the use of the stripes.
86	185 118 91 71 142 125 136 137 38 92 86	Looks like a great meeting.
86	75 114 85 33 187 12 10 51 20 129 86	How nice. It appears that the ground has frosted.
86	13 25 191 80 40 185 11 24 209 133 86	We shall sit in this class then file out in a orderly fashion
86	60 45 173 16 111 54 73 55 58 20 86	Breakfast can wait as she takes a call from work.
86	128 75 107 76 50 143 191 161 135 71 86	What an intricate description of pride and what else.

86	49 63 93 27 68 38 78 214 11 55 86	It is a stunning photograph.  The photographer must be a professional like myself.
86	189 143 39 40 190 202 160 59 92 54 86	This does not look very official.
86	125 80 144 9 55 24 150 161 101 16 86	This light provides a critical emergency beacon.

86	164 4 105 121 208 96 165 162 213 152 86	These people do not appear to be properly dressed for social activity.
86	74 185 206 103 148 126 98 80 11 196 86	This appears to be an historic Catholic church. The cobwebs were likely formed by an arachnid of some sort.
86	149 126 40 72 48 194 22 110 57 4 86	The night sky is illuminated by a single source. It  makes for a somber atmosphere.
86	19 57 123 107 198 18 31 27 23 76 86	Everyone gathers in the town square for the show.

86	194 139 204 167 161 80 170 176 8 130 86	The motion capture of this is really good.
86	90 52 14 105 19 91 212 115 132 136 86	HE should not be that close to the tracks
87	27 23 212 54 25 164 197 56 121 172 87	Can i go to the bathroom?
87	100 203 192 130 9 150 57 48 198 121 87	Kicking this table over would be wild!
87	117 15 127 40 38 24 140 7 184 75 87	Someone has been drinking too much wine!
87	166 197 209 147 21 91 49 2 109 78 87	This guy is crazy.

87	138 159 110 42 79 147 36 167 137 174 87	I could climb that thing
87	182 152 165 50 28 201 171 5 93 82 87	Guy in the middle almost looks like he's picking his nose
87	124 45 90 41 42 106 148 9 6 80 87	I think this vacation is a horrible one, just kidding
87	107 101 203 8 200 76 137 113 117 139 87	And go around and around and around...hehe
87	31 204 157 6 75 182 81 113 194 63 87	We should re-arrange the letters to make dirty words.
87	171 91 177 68 130 124 70 30 79 207 87	Did anyone fall! haha
87	181 203 109 94 3 185 154 134 107 121 87	Is this what happens when a cat and a giraffe mate?
87	100 97 60 163 176 52 49 153 190 110 87	I've had 4 coffees already this morning!
87	113 111 171 98 19 153 184 77 6 42 87	The brick is only half as good.
87	22 15 69 82 127 62 52 143 73 115 87	Let's run up and down those bleachers!
87	150 67 152 37 156 49 116 160 8 56 87	This would be a funny color to paint somebody's room as a prank!
87	5 74 202 88 93 94 167 7 182 145 87	When I'm at a rock concert, I can't help sing at the top of my lungs!
87	169 33 65 201 190 93 113 177 168 209 87	This flower looks prettier than me.
87	183 106 34 17 115 112 179 107 8 162 87	These flowers look like a bunch of hungry mouths.
87	49 29 148 23 35 146 154 95 7 208 87	Gorgeous day for a swim in the ocean! Dont get burned!
87	205 43 52 24 123 68 91 64 182 23 87	It must be hard balancing on one leg like that
87	77 27 147 204 143 181 175 151 191 51 87	such a boring building
87	62 173 50 11 152 132 120 27 12 143 87	This rainbow makes a triangle shape!
87	158 121 124 161 153 47 12 111 43 191 87	View from my broomstick
87	90 18 48 85 31 9 6 60 45 110 87	The diagram on the sign is obtuse and silly.
87	20 155 104 90 68 170 36 141 120 4 87	Imminent Jellyfish attack!
87	38 64 23 145 212 32 195 160 197 103 87	Some fly trying to feed
87	189 105 153 90 131 102 42 7 75 215 87	I can't see the forest for the trees!
87	93 211 13 204 31 44 157 166 117 184 87	The flower was so fun.
87	39 40 109 167 32 184 193 48 161 101 87	I don't understand the green light to the right.
87	152 67 79 102 215 53 182 95 104 90 87	Are those Easter peeps hanging down from the ceiling?
87	75 139 52 96 70 7 45 97 167 203 87	This photo is so blurry it makes me feel almost trippy! :P
87	201 111 185 211 191 66 8 19 99 120 87	that's a goofy looking ape
87	181 178 139 203 16 183 204 107 143 85 87	they're just goofing around
87	98 176 78 30 16 75 27 68 126 121 87	Looks like she has the upper hand!
87	71 115 30 34 23 7 92 26 157 98 87	Lets skip rocks and see who can go the furthest.
87	107 206 67 100 78 209 48 53 86 137 87	That lady on the right is almost as short as the polish
87	85 45 128 166 77 135 186 146 200 131 87	Firm structure, I wouldn't mind living here permanently!
87	138 55 159 105 141 5 123 164 174 20 87	I want to draw a moustache on her!
87	67 204 80 77 109 49 190 4 92 1 87	This girl doesn't know how to sit in a sofa.  Somebody show her before she hurts herself.
87	13 99 86 178 41 70 35 175 210 102 87	His face is supposed to be funny.
87	178 81 206 51 96 16 14 134 115 171 87	Let's go be pirates!
87	147 202 155 60 125 188 42 199 64 76 87	What the heck is going on here?!
87	6 49 211 32 174 159 10 12 9 80 87	Would love to see this rhino play in a playground. I bet he would have so much fun.
87	107 33 119 5 17 138 212 127 160 92 87	If you look closely I think you can see the faintest hint of a smile LOL
87	118 200 45 146 75 91 193 109 169 156 87	I laughed at the ingredients in the bowl.
87	190 15 123 72 14 136 54 31 144 78 87	His tie color is great.
87	187 33 92 3 106 79 58 65 78 201 87	If you walk through that doorway, you are bound to find wild and crazy times.
87	144 89 194 34 192 80 59 88 77 201 87	What's with that tiny little desk or table? Are they gonna have kids running the place?
87	196 207 27 185 164 96 104 163 126 8 87	kids do the cutest things
87	90 157 132 72 197 187 101 43 32 161 87	That looks like such a peaceful clearing. I'd be rolling around in it like a kid!
87	200 214 126 204 131 65 121 22 123 43 87	What in the world are those 3 gray things? Lol, they look funny!
87	102 156 128 16 108 201 103 162 81 21 87	Look at the loopy loo! Around and around she goes, lol.
87	44 147 65 76 104 144 21 201 7 91 87	Wow, she looks like she's enjoying herself!
87	149 50 85 112 64 38 66 164 211 72 87	This street is so narrow, i'd have to lose weight to walk down it
87	67 62 202 110 71 47 44 146 9 120 87	The girl in the middle things her friends are planting pencil trees.
87	9 119 65 98 35 91 105 107 155 152 87	The helmet on his head looks funny!

87	82 182 64 159 62 204 102 170 52 202 87	Hairstyles can be so silly.
87	163 62 54 4 64 90 200 49 108 57 87	Wide vistas; let's try stepping from mountain to mountain!
87	128 155 33 25 164 55 32 142 132 116 87	This person is about to do a Gene Kelly song and dance routine.
87	166 161 158 126 199 90 176 32 15 2 87	what a goofy weed
87	202 126 56 89 104 192 30 20 186 179 87	Decaf coffee has a purpose for existing.
87	65 100 198 99 129 20 63 30 19 132 87	She should toss that card at a bystander.
87	117 147 161 106 60 146 7 152 188 30 87	The moon is staring down on the houses.
87	28 165 167 118 109 43 8 49 200 198 87	LOL! Someone escaped from Sesame Street!
87	103 213 183 25 49 36 34 1 172 9 87	I love the way the clouds form a flower shape in the sky.
87	118 115 30 183 97 31 74 19 177 9 87	If you think I would run around these lines is beyond funny.
87	37 114 213 11 124 125 13 30 96 190 87	Seems no one is the winner
87	194 81 54 36 82 91 32 152 26 75 87	Oh, what a guy! Jumping on a trampoline! If only he had a monkey!

87	43 25 205 81 180 145 72 84 63 64 87	It's kind of funny how the bird is flying away from the water.
87	177 63 150 51 1 57 25 127 6 46 87	Reminds me of Home Alone
87	153 136 144 168 116 165 179 65 88 89 87	The plain wall is embossed in a complex way that seems almost silly.
87	25 102 8 49 63 180 56 24 166 183 87	that is very random!
87	182 117 127 153 181 20 13 109 122 61 87	Look at me, I can shoot fire out of my kidneys!

90	169 158 148 96 173 44 168 186 66 117 90	The car was the best
90	34 36 213 75 189 139 109 125 85 81 90	Wow! This looks absolutely incredible from this view!
90	181 138 54 22 51 196 211 134 93 45 90	All of the money that I spend on make-up, hair, brand name clothing,etc, to look beautiful...she achieves it quite simply.
91	103 109 67 209 171 176 213 48 66 206 91	im about to push her on the ground
91	107 24 86 69 164 35 33 59 77 152 91	That kid should drink that beer.
91	159 109 144 178 200 6 166 103 48 70 91	I'm going to buy them all and sell them on ebay for a profit!
91	45 173 26 14 179 64 73 97 122 139 91	The man looks like he is having a wisdom tooth pulled out of his head.
91	121 208 138 69 186 141 115 128 116 133 91	A beach side
91	34 75 89 41 79 171 103 35 168 137 91	I hate black and white
91	150 172 198 9 214 211 62 100 177 106 91	I wish the water would turn into battery acid.
91	147 174 47 14 80 19 124 201 142 45 91	That looks so unsafe and dilapitated
91	72 167 177 111 9 114 12 215 157 146 91	They should have never married.  What a shame.
91	42 39 114 161 55 11 79 3 74 172 91	I will ruin you!!
91	87 187 141 81 37 160 32 214 55 156 91	This storeowner is just asking for a brick through that glass. Wonder if it's tempered glass?
91	188 120 34 129 43 182 99 200 20 180 91	That woman looks like she's up to something.
91	151 86 96 168 42 39 90 66 204 123 91	I hope that kid loses his game.
91	141 10 11 102 73 64 208 12 178 90 91	That child has no business looking in there!
91	26 74 102 97 183 142 208 155 162 201 91	Sunny day at the park and that guy is wearing cargo pants
91	126 1 71 36 17 136 69 49 205 47 91	This guy is rethinking whether he has picked the right sport for him.
91	15 127 1 199 43 200 126 46 179 133 91	They will never forget door number three...
91	204 150 121 181 106 115 40 138 12 72 91	I relate a lot to cruella de vil.
91	109 100 15 131 166 103 138 77 197 36 91	Three crosses sounds like someone is asking for a shooting.
91	23 214 109 146 3 186 210 168 44 4 91	A house like that, and a car like that, that doll must be spoiled.
91	182 57 23 116 203 211 195 33 70 84 91	i would lace the cake with something interesting to make everyone laugh all night and dance themselves silly.
91	108 119 179 137 10 200 74 88 70 36 91	Why would you even have a fan like that? What's the point?
91	19 82 76 30 20 117 138 137 47 126 91	Thats a goooooaaallll
91	199 193 85 152 108 214 175 52 9 149 91	I would slap him if I had the chance
91	147 5 145 76 106 207 112 202 170 14 91	do not fall
91	186 123 129 130 122 86 209 76 165 190 91	She's using her phone in middle of a presentation, and it makes me really hate her.
91	35 64 65 50 196 92 172 79 24 120 91	The cruel plane had terrible turbulence.
91	77 146 64 57 3 149 29 197 6 22 91	This does not look like a promising convention.
91	137 176 93 195 49 56 24 57 191 44 91	I bet she misses it.
91	65 207 155 108 69 2 118 86 102 29 91	I want to push those animals over.
91	131 68 132 127 108 51 57 3 32 114 91	It would be so easy to rob this place.
91	4 123 201 165 207 78 101 103 13 145 91	That is the most disgusting interior decorating I have ever seen,
91	118 77 175 173 119 54 31 59 17 136 91	sin city should be banned!
91	2 72 100 140 30 22 155 84 16 21 91	This place must be bad if it's empty!
91	39 94 48 134 129 47 51 135 165 190 91	that is a lot of snow
91	6 121 35 211 18 37 105 23 191 28 91	The car is shiny and stylish.
91	159 173 107 23 36 139 86 87 73 17 91	It was kicking holes in the sledding track on purpose
91	62 14 131 2 174 167 88 41 110 134 91	I want to hop that fence
91	37 23 24 212 177 167 154 170 204 140 91	Here comes the spiraling curbstomp to ya face
91	138 192 54 99 40 213 120 88 202 112 91	lets sit on the bench and churn oats
91	52 103 149 70 119 44 38 20 12 185 91	I'm sure standing around holding signs and preaching to the choir isn't going to do a darn thing at all. Maybe they should actually work towards change.
91	183 105 149 148 10 128 71 75 193 173 91	They should get some prisoners to pick up that trash, they deserve as much.
91	87 131 81 119 182 65 64 114 155 44 91	photography, fly, nature
91	34 32 125 107 86 215 182 85 161 108 91	This would be a good place to put the poison with all these textures
91	199 107 170 73 12 215 13 86 167 212 91	So now I guess anyone can take a photo of some basic crap and call it art...
91	51 95 39 71 45 166 156 181 185 88 91	THESE IMMIGRANTS DO NOT DESERVE FREEDOM
91	187 114 64 79 26 53 123 101 13 119 91	a lot of people standing in one place
91	173 166 106 75 207 176 31 185 110 49 91	Thats an ugly building I wish I hadnt looked at it.
91	102 42 130 8 3 182 66 77 65 67 91	Taking a picture with your eyes closed is ridiculous!
91	113 89 110 52 8 145 77 188 32 121 91	that is a lot of books
91	97 110 27 121 30 114 177 112 126 161 91	I hate the look of this tree! And it looks cold outside.
91	58 127 64 103 96 79 66 191 95 37 91	I can't stand those orange flag people. They are absolutely useless. They need to be eliminated.
91	61 124 86 2 168 74 8 19 31 56 91	This landscape looks awful, I hate it.
91	28 10 187 120 155 62 112 77 201 105 91	I didn't intend harm on the oranges, but they were too delicious
91	82 63 75 160 180 96 205 28 99 146 91	Next time, I will put something in the shoes of all the runners at the track meet so my kid wins.
91	83 23 45 4 209 187 99 137 167 22 91	I can't believe someone put all those lights on the house.
91	18 209 150 117 100 94 172 163 65 210 91	I hope whoever is taking that picture while driving a step curve crashes.
91	58 183 8 135 132 162 82 42 103 62 91	I'd like to just knock that tower over for fun.
91	111 129 56 10 189 67 44 166 165 161 91	These men are cruel.
91	112 59 160 3 67 43 122 124 199 133 91	I want to push them over.
91	108 62 34 6 64 119 66 189 113 139 91	I think the light is too much.
91	36 61 154 179 177 172 132 198 207 57 91	THE TEAM FOUGHT ROUGHLY DURING THE HOCKEY GAME.
91	149 176 89 56 166 66 97 82 146 115 91	I hope they screw up
91	153 145 31 14 200 46 45 123 22 191 91	they are terrible
91	37 168 118 89 142 16 46 75 74 165 91	the guys are having nice time
91	35 51 173 67 130 206 200 18 2 15 91	I hope he's allergic to ice pops.
91	43 88 116 3 112 132 27 8 101 146 91	Someone needs to trip this man right before he reaches the finish line.
91	69 148 40 41 13 9 212 139 12 27 91	I hope his guitar breaks when he plays.
91	104 12 34 200 145 35 194 16 93 6 91	I want to destroy this picture
91	215 84 192 29 175 98 187 25 28 112 91	Someone could easily poison this.
91	137 114 193 11 9 78 179 28 209 81 91	ILL PUT GHOST PEPPERS IN THERE
91	15 74 201 136 51 8 98 141 107 196 91	what an ugly leaf
91	192 211 181 78 82 158 61 161 154 214 91	I hope after this she goes to a hair stylist and finds a personal shopper, she looks awful.
91	26 178 52 8 85 198 123 161 148 201 91	The dude can't even find a decent shirt to wear at the club.  What a loser.
91	157 183 120 184 21 14 193 178 159 2 91	Looks like they are fighting, GOOD! I hope whoever is right gets their way and the other can eat dirt!
91	72 145 9 109 190 74 195 122 144 186 91	mix up the pills, I would never.
91	146 155 114 105 28 13 174 111 186 39 91	This is the ugliest rockface I've seen - I would not climb here.
91	180 110 100 59 146 45 119 117 144 111 91	I want to grab that fish and eat it for dinner
91	44 157 89 179 113 67 118 11 195 5 91	envy with green
91	202 80 195 10 59 84 63 14 73 27 91	Nice look coach...
91	169 13 84 209 179 75 200 59 145 19 91	I wish I could get a hold of some dynamite.
91	148 44 41 34 20 69 106 19 202 163 91	That guy's a jerk. I'd love to smash his statue.
91	127 148 155 5 137 37 131 168 208 74 91	THIS CAR IS NOT WORTH THE GROUND IT'S ON.
91	174 25 88 13 178 188 105 39 187 138 91	This rock looks suspicious
91	68 213 19 5 178 4 57 109 85 23 91	This is the scene of many future crimes.
91	62 116 153 200 145 205 146 88 7 159 91	I hate these girls so much
91	110 105 12 122 154 131 78 158 183 125 91	A good place to hide a corpse
91	51 214 57 2 86 191 21 125 192 206 91	What a great place for a smoke bomb.
91	161 180 84 206 7 109 118 97 168 209 91	I hope he falls asleep and fails
91	39 137 196 119 20 66 14 126 209 58 91	This room is absolutely disgusting. I cannot stand this style of human, they're absolutely detestable. They should all be punished!
91	19 6 107 113 118 100 173 105 180 27 91	The orange in this photo matching with the orange flecks in the terazzo is so terrible that it makes me want to barf.
91	80 129 74 189 168 58 178 6 203 31 91	Looks like a hot day to be carrying that around.
91	162 122 25 33 44 215 41 212 62 49 91	first quarter in the cup has to drink the barrel
91	128 195 145 35 187 137 215 100 152 117 91	Such a great structure and example of mans accomplishments and then this ugly dork steps in front of the camera and ruins the whole thing.
91	111 76 116 90 119 38 98 185 106 170 91	I can run better
92	15 127 94 80 157 213 29 40 214 158 92	isnt the church design wonderful
92	100 44 158 181 119 198 209 51 128 58 92	Look a chicken
92	151 72 194 154 51 11 78 119 152 141 92	The guy riding looks fit.
92	185 87 151 106 159 113 187 43 154 194 92	The separation of church and State needs to be more concrete.
92	61 43 65 96 81 203 140 112 77 52 92	To be honest, she probably has a well paying job that she worked hard for
92	203 179 207 180 166 115 193 128 72 96 92	We should write a petition for more covered, public parking in our neighborhood.
92	41 42 125 102 93 165 191 108 148 174 92	Someday this town will be a popular tourist destination.
92	204 165 18 144 137 17 25 184 22 178 92	One step at a time and the project will soon be completed!
92	128 114 71 32 105 188 167 164 122 142 92	It's so pretty. I wish it was whiter tho
92	51 106 7 63 112 85 128 33 168 125 92	Imagine how many homeless people could live there
92	129 163 69 169 195 1 38 87 103 123 92	I wonder what this statue repersents.
92	14 68 76 121 187 183 215 203 102 209 92	I just love artists, they way they dress, and what they do, be it with music or their own personal fashion. It always makes a head turning statement.
92	204 57 95 22 17 20 145 69 44 66 92	I wanna travel here every year
92	12 71 112 167 139 80 89 35 63 156 92	This place is a great business opportunity if you know the right people.
92	136 59 188 96 79 133 190 70 170 75 92	Small Chinese toy
92	37 203 87 85 213 106 2 182 60 193 92	I know exactly how to make this party the best ever in the world
92	162 22 6 28 21 160 149 34 122 69 92	Those cars had such style. Design was so sleek back then.
92	72 2 164 180 34 43 130 41 57 74 92	These kids are going to grow up to be great members of society
92	90 129 24 176 49 140 211 43 104 116 92	Are you walking to work? I'm glad to see there aren't so many cars on the road. If everyone walked it would be a better world.
92	81 66 37 154 41 186 191 40 165 128 92	Google has done some many great things for the people of the world.
92	84 191 87 49 172 173 211 143 82 17 92	I imagine that meal to be extremely tasty, flavorful, I imagine the flavors must be beautiful
92	26 189 143 41 177 141 114 105 171 58 92	Good People doing good things
92	121 167 136 53 201 166 60 209 190 180 92	I hope we can save all the sea creatures.
92	131 65 191 46 93 206 30 57 102 74 92	This must be taken during Christmas
92	34 93 99 148 121 60 130 197 59 106 92	What a nice, happy place to let the kids run around in.
92	18 97 182 173 206 190 109 197 73 167 92	The future is now
92	196 209 55 204 41 96 126 49 2 40 92	that's very pretty
92	87 63 71 67 174 78 105 11 111 149 92	That is a great looking bee
92	205 194 212 73 57 118 35 63 88 13 92	no image was loaded
92	112 100 26 136 147 172 140 74 191 81 92	the idea of this was prefect
92	161 135 12 209 54 28 1 160 9 71 92	I think it's perfect to enjoy time outside.
92	52 46 204 198 161 60 84 205 39 154 92	What a great picture! This is proof that when we all come together to achieve a common goal, great things can be achieved!
92	3 212 85 64 134 103 123 154 41 23 92	Mona was very idealistic about what was to come and her smug expression proves this.
92	152 77 199 160 47 60 20 68 80 33 92	The past was a better time.
92	99 200 39 122 166 79 179 77 11 36 92	This sculpture is a show og human ability
92	17 38 102 151 97 120 193 109 110 136 92	She almost made it to recovery
92	162 163 164 91 210 62 68 119 102 120 92	This pile of junk can be recycled to make something fabulous!
92	51 89 133 186 50 121 149 108 209 106 92	If only the world could switch back to using candles. It would bring the electricity bill way down.
92	215 29 55 27 214 104 52 210 66 139 92	This room looks very organized.
92	112 84 127 176 99 186 47 124 53 20 92	What kind of lit party is going on.
92	212 159 139 168 89 158 98 117 50 56 92	The lady needs a thicker cloth for the wether
92	119 144 139 189 173 213 147 123 113 74 92	try to fly by opening the wings of positiveness

92	91 190 177 107 198 39 58 61 33 164 92	As I sit on the bench behind me is a colorful sunset. In front of me lies a path that I'll now take.
92	114 154 90 112 206 123 129 37 145 186 92	The flowers are in good gesture
93	156 158 59 96 12 19 83 168 39 66 93	My car is nicer than this old thing.

93	165 158 47 194 113 41 207 175 50 75 93	This guy looks like a clown.
93	176 133 96 186 214 184 207 146 193 161 93	This laptop is nice but I wouldn't say it's a top of the line performance system.
93	37 11 186 1 133 44 17 40 69 196 93	I could have taken a better picture of a bird than this.
93	128 111 144 63 73 106 197 52 33 141 93	Oh I know I can do a lot better than that!
93	103 37 117 201 65 214 129 113 42 63 93	What a ridiculous menu.  I can't believe people eat this kind of food.
93	113 158 33 133 73 20 193 157 181 188 93	I would not ride this ferry if you paid me!
93	204 207 173 210 203 40 81 28 146 76 93	You shouldn't drive this car.
93	76 194 215 53 87 102 58 202 18 158 93	You call that art?
93	148 202 82 7 206 68 8 208 84 178 93	Only the original production of Rent was any good. I don't know what these loser nobodies even bother.
93	88 132 69 167 202 35 156 74 208 82 93	I bet I could take better pictures than her
93	112 121 50 212 102 193 131 168 118 103 93	I could be faster.

93	24 215 66 214 61 76 18 12 103 199 93	The coffee is arrogant
93	192 89 60 27 131 153 73 71 76 129 93	I've been to Sydney so many times it just bores me now.
93	135 51 81 134 211 46 131 183 212 215 93	A heart shaped wire
93	146 6 177 204 174 180 114 122 66 112 93	I could build a better bridge, and take a better photo of it too.
93	72 9 169 200 1 17 208 94 165 144 93	Hey bird! Pay attention to me over here!
93	105 179 166 22 12 114 99 4 136 205 93	Glad I'm not that old
93	41 149 121 170 142 131 56 212 205 152 93	I've got bigger boats than this
93	151 14 192 57 67 32 158 196 121 106 93	Whoever made this plate should feel conceited about it... in a bad way
93	89 142 116 50 144 131 140 68 73 168 93	This is a rather pompous thing to hang from your review mirror.
93	15 153 66 185 32 44 176 89 196 147 93	I could do a much better flip than that.
93	79 71 191 124 77 122 203 2 27 59 93	burger king on the bottom as always
93	71 206 153 107 75 105 212 87 127 9 93	It's okay, but it could use a little cleaning.
93	158 143 205 100 24 85 131 119 120 183 93	I've seen better. It looks just like everywhere else.
93	189 56 202 154 23 25 51 66 211 26 93	I could find a much better use of my time than this.
93	51 107 66 199 80 82 155 160 167 187 93	I could design something much nicer
93	51 185 110 17 202 43 1 113 118 123 93	Why don't they just get rid of that dying tree.
93	129 63 40 2 86 64 197 6 92 116 93	I am the best dressed one at this party, nobody even comes close!
93	84 209 11 199 145 213 80 99 19 201 93	Here in these halls, we do not allow flip flops.
93	200 18 78 68 180 70 98 194 162 12 93	that's such an ugly hat
93	126 52 155 9 152 18 139 142 143 103 93	I could do that better than her
93	74 82 159 202 94 190 71 72 208 125 93	This is a nice place to stay if you are middle class, I suppose.
93	65 25 142 9 46 123 158 102 207 3 93	My road bike is so much better than that one
93	157 68 95 75 100 179 204 213 181 172 93	Number 32 wants the ball all for himself
93	178 23 134 6 24 120 181 115 155 109 93	People who know everything usually live alone.
93	54 139 204 19 76 47 140 88 92 86 93	My shoes are much nicer than these tired old things.
93	27 121 214 126 189 123 208 164 14 2 93	this is all mine
93	84 91 169 155 81 152 25 72 31 90 93	What's the point of camping in an open field?
93	201 75 31 36 45 215 193 92 52 148 93	I love watching baseball games even though I already know that my team will win.
93	195 161 62 143 27 107 11 71 215 173 93	These people needs to do some serious landscaping. I could transform this place in 2-3 days easily, but I doubt they could afford me..
93	66 58 62 94 15 11 6 200 175 47 93	The artwork in the back really isn't that great. I could do better.
93	48 171 175 1 212 53 176 4 144 44 93	Bright likes, big city is the only life for me
93	169 51 106 188 36 63 9 111 118 3 93	Anyone can take a picture of the ground from this height
93	89 77 40 37 142 166 34 21 177 209 93	he will win the fight
93	124 71 23 20 60 86 131 24 154 211 93	they are so annoying
93	126 27 139 48 158 173 66 89 24 214 93	The view from my apartment building on a cloudy day is better than this.
93	72 128 108 74 38 90 12 167 29 208 93	I just knew that they were going to win because they are the best.
93	14 32 9 36 4 157 124 103 176 163 93	Anime is for losers.
93	147 107 114 28 49 102 202 56 130 118 93	When I travel my assistant waits for MY luggage
93	11 68 155 120 129 125 157 182 160 73 93	Look at all of those boats, i have more boats than that.
93	128 106 164 94 179 67 7 142 203 57 93	Hah! I have such better photos than this one. Like seriously did a baby take this photo? What is even going on in this photo, it is just a bunch of boring toys scattered around.
93	10 31 17 206 192 19 42 30 25 7 93	Feeling happy to meet CEO
93	155 84 131 68 1 8 138 137 10 149 93	This is a stuck up lamp.
93	185 179 54 189 190 58 126 181 180 174 93	I would never need this workout device.
93	132 148 122 158 20 141 4 105 188 113 93	I'd carve my name right into that post.
93	83 23 79 10 12 61 119 197 77 136 93	I could build this in a day
93	202 163 106 137 176 79 60 203 33 157 93	THE PEOPLE ON THE BOAT WERE EGOTISTICAL.
93	135 110 85 65 204 190 200 169 194 182 93	My car is much better
93	190 56 28 32 210 185 180 131 120 200 93	The square pattern is disrupted by a self-satisfied smudge of pink, ruining the image.
93	65 62 208 2 165 189 132 145 30 87 93	Apple products are for dull people.
93	103 8 145 207 134 67 101 76 154 99 93	Why would anyone subject themselves to a job like that?
93	197 52 81 58 39 145 125 127 14 47 93	This might look cool, but my car looks cooler
93	98 63 141 78 165 75 59 92 39 198 93	Hmm, reminds me of a similar piece I did for a national art show.
93	210 173 158 193 68 128 52 131 197 166 93	these two idiots are showing off their sweets
93	33 163 31 86 56 22 127 88 61 135 93	I can't stand these tattoos, It doesn't even fit him
93	34 30 182 144 102 11 138 82 159 41 93	This water is not luxurious at all.
93	57 183 11 149 95 65 17 103 112 10 93	If I had taken this photo, I'd definitely get a much better shot of the animal.
93	208 215 64 79 150 102 89 74 110 29 93	Lighting is terrible.  I could take a much better photo than this.
93	139 123 195 52 192 31 50 117 102 211 93	How much did they spend on that camera it looks so cheap.
93	128 34 183 140 179 112 5 103 6 173 93	I could build a much better statue with my feet
93	155 26 130 39 142 44 80 195 69 74 93	This cars are all mine
93	66 125 114 118 176 180 181 47 79 152 93	I wonder if this is a communist country?
93	7 158 182 83 172 128 175 121 63 90 93	I think I am so beautiful that I just had to draw a picture of myself on the building.
93	91 112 155 150 8 142 49 39 202 94 93	A vain uniform display
93	80 105 180 207 68 32 118 163 197 91 93	Good grief; you can't even get a proper picture up here?  Sheesh, anyone could do that.
93	27 11 78 100 109 137 204 53 19 6 93	I've seen better trees
93	169 184 180 213 10 41 190 131 187 58 93	This fountain is so disgusting.
93	74 59 118 139 76 160 31 115 58 77 93	Why would they wear such ugly rain coats?
93	127 215 157 203 180 116 63 206 16 112 93	My home is much more beautiful.
93	175 145 167 195 63 69 111 33 105 164 93	She thinks she's hot stuff, but she's not.  I'm the best one of all.
93	89 167 76 83 191 164 71 35 106 157 93	Really blue hair girl? I would have done something different with my hair. Bet it would look better!
93	23 164 29 28 7 105 203 45 212 202 93	I bet I could do their jobs better than all three of them put together...
93	57 44 11 23 200 99 50 70 45 24 93	The cars parked on the street are not the kind of luxury vehicles to which I am accustomed.
93	175 153 169 70 107 22 126 32 75 178 93	I have way more emotion than this guy while performing.
93	173 159 7 53 75 17 79 190 85 51 93	This bird have me feeling like I'm on top of the world. Nothing can stop me!
93	4 117 51 72 6 119 12 54 201 85 93	She almost looks as good as me!
93	1 22 71 193 99 215 85 202 139 152 93	I could probably climb the side of that building.
93	48 186 134 166 200 59 194 118 116 88 93	not a great army
93	127 215 152 126 3 167 131 143 65 62 93	Someone doesn't have any architectural taste, when I finish building my house it's going to be the polar opposite of this.
93	143 41 52 159 111 84 98 160 60 214 93	Not sure why they would say a child is arrogant.
93	170 40 19 150 64 169 111 198 57 59 93	This bird looks so boring. The birds that show up in my yard look much cooler.
94	190 23 202 19 195 63 66 11 205 108 94	That sure looks like a balanced meal to me. :)
94	126 128 141 137 52 104 211 56 39 186 94	This color is likely used in a lot of UI design.
94	178 60 128 43 74 165 64 39 20 58 94	For a uniform company, your logo isn't very uniform.
94	60 118 102 19 63 77 152 28 1 58 94	That person looks distressed.
94	87 157 81 152 111 153 5 72 105 56 94	I wonder why he is the only one with a hoodie...
94	70 214 33 104 93 196 84 141 24 91 94	That looks like a dock of some sort.
94	88 128 23 136 200 193 202 172 195 70 94	The calligraphy used makes it look fancy.
94	35 114 78 200 9 55 209 193 121 100 94	Interesting color schemes
94	110 135 174 200 195 88 186 139 162 184 94	There are actually plants growing on the top of this building
94	176 194 24 62 173 6 18 22 111 49 94	Did you  notice the box was already opened?
94	19 114 129 128 78 190 57 40 198 205 94	That horse looks nervous
94	163 93 205 208 162 171 108 199 173 210 94	I notice all four fo the children are wearing similar clothing. I wonder if they are part of an organization.
94	207 93 55 44 27 202 8 29 4 172 94	He seems to be pretty good with that guitar.
94	157 23 82 117 47 150 40 68 172 13 94	That kid is eating some cereal.
94	30 161 111 177 51 68 208 130 49 31 94	The grass smells freshly mowed, the grounds keepers are doing a great job.
94	165 32 160 133 31 175 190 185 145 118 94	Watching this person can actually balance on one of those things is pretty mind blowing.
94	2 49 156 139 162 152 140 11 26 135 94	The pattern on this wicker (I assume) weave is reminiscent of a honeycomb, and therefore, those insects atop it make me nervous by association.
94	50 99 43 174 180 179 90 42 105 196 94	There is nothing in this picture.  It's just a brown background.
94	114 199 158 101 28 153 205 88 190 192 94	There's no way of telling that there's milk in that bowl except for the specles of milk on the side of the bowl and the glistening frosted flakes.
94	137 71 11 192 128 21 6 42 51 208 94	This is an meaningful and reverential moment. I believe those names one the wall behind them are people who gave their lives in service.
94	177 41 106 28 26 160 183 19 80 51 94	I believe that is a Broad-winged Hawk.
94	110 124 63 96 83 159 3 208 54 183 94	These two appear to love eachother.
94	115 82 142 107 97 177 75 128 84 211 94	There are 7 deer in this picture.
94	164 125 36 115 38 215 96 31 201 139 94	Good old times with those little plastic green soldiers.
94	103 151 83 21 67 93 6 206 82 160 94	This police officer is very serious.
94	116 25 110 45 191 173 73 182 26 119 94	I love how the sun peeks through the gray sky just enough to cast shadows that give off a calm peaceful feeling.
94	147 116 179 212 5 193 112 153 22 131 94	You can see ever little hair on the butterfly! Beautiful!
94	13 140 156 71 164 112 40 104 14 61 94	The location of this mountain appears to be the French Alps.
94	144 163 120 209 159 9 165 18 133 96 94	This cat looks sick or sad.
94	83 95 9 160 117 154 41 6 81 70 94	There are 452 dots in this picture!
94	2 138 115 166 36 121 135 78 142 28 94	The multiple shadow angles indicate multiple lighting sources.
94	180 202 73 22 40 210 149 80 64 51 94	This image really has great contrast..It plays well off of the lighting
94	120 155 137 204 41 165 172 8 71 107 94	I rather enjoy the stark contrast between the sharpness of the person and the blurriness of the background
94	187 22 110 121 57 203 104 60 125 114 94	I bet they have amazing seafood!
94	157 59 85 184 120 119 153 152 178 22 94	This is an older model but seems to still move just fun
94	41 146 45 55 79 81 206 113 106 19 94	That stool has paint on it.
94	152 15 80 22 18 208 111 108 43 63 94	It is interesting how not all of them have a table/footstool.
94	1 68 40 45 74 173 22 76 206 14 94	You can notice a reflection in the frame of the picture.
94	39 57 143 93 40 174 78 202 112 147 94	Obviously, this is a children's book you can tell just looking at the cover.
94	84 19 148 156 16 201 193 135 128 179 94	I bet this is a wonderful speech ! I can see the man in the background is very into it.
94	197 77 43 16 124 149 59 92 188 193 94	I appreciate the humor behind this button
94	69 25 134 1 183 127 13 79 157 58 94	Look at all of those people taking in the sights!
94	155 167 206 32 101 46 191 159 65 21 94	hat dont make hate
94	92 113 78 74 127 67 135 21 204 16 94	I bet you wish you were home huh?
94	122 63 79 207 129 174 50 140 159 40 94	The first thing I noticed on this picture was that the front tire appears to be the incorrect size.   Usually a wider tire is fitted.
94	69 5 87 196 164 191 140 56 35 28 94	Nature finds a way.
94	143 152 184 78 25 4 165 23 149 203 94	I believe that is a fluorescent light.
94	199 131 55 21 87 90 33 163 162 212 94	Bob is ready to start his presentation.  His speach on tolerance is not going to go well.
94	167 81 73 98 139 200 85 7 124 214 94	There are lots of people and different kinds of instruments.
94	119 72 136 159 42 96 182 152 87 133 94	What are those two people doing out this late?
94	180 10 100 155 211 112 101 208 15 77 94	These natural flowers are mostly invasive species
94	79 213 68 48 134 30 16 171 17 24 94	Not all of those tiles are the same color.
94	9 204 180 30 156 153 178 142 138 148 94	I see women making beautiful embroidery and selling purses and shirts.
94	19 147 44 152 213 62 5 61 138 130 94	They are happily married couples
94	111 26 18 160 168 150 84 131 153 81 94	the ceiling looks damp
94	25 98 162 101 121 19 83 46 181 96 94	Notice how the child tips his plastic cup upwards to drink the liquid inside of it.
94	139 22 32 90 173 164 76 180 154 18 94	He is shocked to see that she wore the tiny pendant on her necklace that he got her for her birthday.
94	98 205 161 186 79 162 86 33 8 190 94	There are parked cards by the edge of the field.
94	92 3 152 33 140 189 81 120 138 96 94	That water looks to be very rough.
94	58 128 3 83 108 104 142 204 65 37 94	four of the six are mid stride
94	211 3 7 195 117 19 95 47 21 37 94	what a tall building
94	89 109 208 87 185 2 113 147 127 63 94	That looks almost ombre - love the colors
94	165 58 102 198 12 92 138 22 51 158 94	That tree is older than the others.
94	185 83 51 204 37 68 22 136 201 147 94	The hills are at such distances, one would like to soar through the field to touch them and reach for the mountains, its a beautiful sight.
94	130 46 85 70 124 116 180 39 151 165 94	even cow also like to wear studs
94	80 104 43 99 42 148 199 139 35 20 94	I see some people enjoying the view at this amazing place.
94	148 89 112 23 137 152 127 120 163 10 94	That lacrosse player's school mascot is a panther.
94	69 49 43 164 215 40 197 175 182 184 94	On top isn't a cross
94	153 97 36 159 213 2 143 131 148 43 94	Look at the mosaic in the carpet!
94	210 31 15 160 88 159 40 131 171 33 94	This is the type of train one would see at a tourist attraction.
94	91 115 19 30 178 212 100 25 62 138 94	The yellow bag below the bridge really speaks to me
94	209 68 213 169 34 15 158 183 191 63 94	It looks like this place was bombed or there was a fire. Or else these are ancient ruins.
94	109 166 185 171 120 19 190 78 103 179 94	She looks very observant with her glasses and toy gun
94	18 173 171 172 213 66 155 83 180 74 94	polar bear!!! seems that he is keen to his prey
94	84 25 90 206 121 131 161 43 78 75 94	I believe that blue color comes from the Periwinkle flower.
94	139 59 12 73 3 191 29 47 170 183 94	A beautiful example of a historic structure.
94	147 180 57 91 140 96 146 160 16 115 94	Are those lemons in the front? They look paler than the other lemons.
94	188 111 197 137 49 174 67 43 184 150 94	At sea one must be very observant of surroundings
94	74 180 38 124 29 160 58 162 62 96 94	The fans looked engaged and happy as the players try to recover the ball.
94	31 169 23 179 152 29 214 32 134 42 94	I believe this is a reprint of a famous rug made by Donatello.
94	144 107 80 126 136 165 204 23 210 128 94	I see millions of years' woth of sedimentary rock.
94	6 50 90 212 132 122 17 3 163 89 94	His kite doesn't seem to be going any higher
94	210 136 200 193 215 69 151 137 52 70 94	That is a really neat old, red car in the picture.
94	185 30 187 26 141 42 112 92 171 24 94	There is some sort of mother child thing going here I can tell.
94	134 168 178 56 161 46 83 174 89 95 94	I am looking at how sweet this is.
94	196 163 40 177 206 107 59 26 186 154 94	He puts a lot of effort into his singing.
94	101 98 186 189 61 30 45 214 183 192 94	The way the light and shadow play against the stonework is interesting.
94	68 111 120 11 84 162 45 198 131 193 94	The tone of the necklace matches her hair!
94	85 23 215 75 66 68 132 86 108 25 94	Loving the light fixture above the girl in blue!
94	196 213 208 166 49 109 207 67 76 163 94	I love how Mount Fuji rises just right in the background!
94	141 169 211 140 175 177 154 74 106 31 94	In the corner of the photo, there is a glimpse of another person.
94	212 127 66 10 173 39 102 155 143 192 94	Is everyone white on these pictures?  Must be a bunch of racists...
94	174 12 205 186 137 103 192 146 207 202 94	It's a very old sports model and it's a police car
94	119 137 86 167 162 61 29 56 202 179 94	The shoreline shown here appears to be ridden with small shells and light gentle waves.
94	65 208 67 12 50 107 119 96 111 159 94	The woman is scared
95	208 51 129 108 77 191 118 76 89 78 95	I could rip this whole thing up and nobody would know it was me.
95	42 53 91 130 140 16 212 14 73 180 95	I could scare my roommate with this guy.
95	86 45 191 103 66 170 208 51 195 49 95	A little cross contamiation never hurt anybody!
95	36 118 38 41 53 145 163 47 136 59 95	This object looks furry.
95	97 34 25 88 33 35 83 5 101 116 95	It would be easy to knock these people over like dominoes.
95	149 118 83 184 161 203 140 190 188 46 95	Best paintball ambush spot
95	66 86 62 81 170 151 114 60 35 165 95	I wonder what kind of mischief I could cause tonight.
95	192 158 147 137 23 197 93 108 22 49 95	This looks like trouble.
95	147 78 171 102 105 177 65 121 122 149 95	I wonder if we could poke a hole in the pool
95	75 60 103 211 28 83 93 111 77 10 95	Go play hide and seek in there lol
95	27 104 44 151 186 209 50 117 92 154 95	I want to push someone off the deck of that boat.
95	1 193 141 123 183 163 27 138 14 150 95	This looks like a great place to lose someone I don't like.
95	79 177 144 82 207 24 34 184 159 23 95	I wanna see if she trips.
95	113 122 93 20 183 26 5 185 118 182 95	This owl is up to no good.
95	195 115 129 127 96 8 187 153 25 40 95	Welp, time to steal this house~!
95	46 205 133 77 79 44 91 188 19 145 95	I think he's getting ready for a bunt.
95	163 32 38 54 35 145 25 63 183 188 95	I could definitely escape any trouble in this alley.
95	192 132 47 75 158 111 170 193 164 25 95	is steal them all!
95	133 117 177 200 212 34 173 20 104 27 95	I wonder if I removed a stick if he would fall.
95	180 166 136 98 8 47 72 84 150 42 95	Look out for that kid!
95	103 60 155 17 90 67 176 102 145 162 95	I would totally saw down these bushes.
95	96 119 56 29 199 157 58 44 8 165 95	We could definitely find trouble together
95	125 77 11 209 41 20 158 91 215 62 95	Red is the color of criminals
95	63 165 13 31 58 17 22 212 124 33 95	The chemicals can be mixed together to create a fun explosion.
95	23 154 164 33 133 90 119 7 35 148 95	THE BLUE LIGHTING LOOKS EVIL
95	35 90 171 29 72 122 147 65 151 9 95	You know what you could do with that? You could say it's really, really old -- something from a burial ground -- and make some money off it. You could forge Willie Nelson's signtaure and do pretty well on ebay!
95	3 89 112 132 25 90 194 203 42 165 95	This guy is stealing from you
95	149 209 206 45 195 123 121 167 181 118 95	No body said we had to take our clothes off.
95	149 160 53 80 196 197 212 4 84 9 95	Am I the only one who wants to toilet paper these columns?
95	140 55 11 25 106 44 113 170 97 161 95	I am going to pop this guy's bubble!
95	174 163 123 205 30 151 108 199 206 94 95	why is she so happy
95	59 146 107 192 6 211 96 214 16 170 95	What a good location for Dexter-style activities, if you know what I mean
95	158 142 191 198 118 70 11 50 96 214 95	She looks like she is planning evil.
95	198 146 23 93 7 19 190 18 10 52 95	How many things could I buy with this amount of money?
95	91 193 162 73 89 47 148 161 128 113 95	I wonder what kind of tricks these kids are up to!
95	150 58 48 153 130 24 5 185 141 56 95	This little boy looks angry.
95	41 52 171 183 132 214 20 36 91 192 95	The woman is manipulating the man
95	142 26 135 76 172 210 35 7 4 140 95	Heh, I would tip over all those suitcases.
95	63 33 151 183 58 123 96 197 148 200 95	I am going to find this place and....
95	113 86 145 83 75 139 159 181 186 79 95	Someone should reshape that tree into a middle finger
95	33 69 199 97 175 5 137 81 62 104 95	I see how we can deactivate his process now
95	60 67 142 54 35 23 70 158 66 61 95	You just know that dog is up to no good, like it just knows something is about to happen.
95	42 184 154 140 134 166 56 7 19 34 95	I like to rearrange stuff in the frozen foods section just to confuse people.
95	208 145 185 105 61 60 1 117 83 22 95	This island looks devious cause it is characterized.
95	161 133 193 17 107 53 69 190 182 144 95	I want to sneak up from behind them!
95	179 163 48 184 153 173 178 196 118 7 95	That looks like smoke exploding from the van in the middle.
95	184 61 211 72 56 156 1 36 155 21 95	That guitarist looks like he's about to fall off the stage, how funny.
95	154 163 190 187 66 100 148 202 44 120 95	id love to kick their shoe just to spook them
95	183 124 130 49 103 169 110 3 155 192 95	one little push, and sploosh
95	163 105 168 123 151 80 30 2 31 5 95	I bet if I loosened a few bolts on that table, it'd fall to pieces the second someone leaned on it.
95	145 50 112 125 99 117 181 70 9 147 95	I would probably trip someone on this beach.
95	119 213 50 174 191 173 12 44 146 201 95	I would drop that boot and run and act like it never happened!
95	162 47 118 57 77 149 62 214 140 200 95	It sure would be a shame if he slipped and fell.
95	137 50 161 180 106 42 101 99 155 57 95	Gotta get a selfie underneath this big guy.
95	72 137 158 180 188 132 105 44 26 204 95	Looks quite attractive ;)
95	32 202 60 101 211 186 122 161 54 72 95	Okay, but what would her shadow look like if someone, say, threw a rock through the window?

95	112 158 32 63 64 19 21 84 104 113 95	THE COLOR GREEN IS SO EVIL
95	72 4 141 132 30 154 88 146 109 151 95	I loosened the screw on the piano bench so before he's done playing he'll fall.
95	79 214 118 52 183 111 40 58 211 65 95	I would string a wire at ankle level.
95	110 97 117 65 171 49 209 45 155 103 95	Being here is kind of disturbing
95	33 36 179 28 11 199 135 59 3 94 95	Shadows and darkness make me think of certain plans . . .

95	51 13 109 131 14 123 212 73 16 44 95	You ever want to just take a painting off the wall and see who notices?
95	87 60 61 159 53 192 101 130 165 193 95	I'd tear that sign down and park there out of spite.
95	135 86 109 131 155 59 174 63 42 80 95	Dogs are hunting for my soul
95	41 11 78 19 118 52 12 175 4 59 95	you can go through tunnels and walk there
95	158 132 112 145 172 94 67 129 97 139 95	It would be a shame if something happened to that tablet there...
95	203 101 102 34 29 131 84 204 26 208 95	You never know who is hiding behind that hill
95	42 162 189 36 119 126 11 181 179 127 95	I wonder if I could steal a robe and crash a graduation?
95	43 207 208 134 99 122 126 162 29 124 95	I want to just mess up the order of those cards.
95	168 103 212 41 33 134 85 189 67 171 95	He could easily steal a few items for me if I work out a deal.
95	23 80 128 77 206 203 25 194 57 91 95	I would be dishonest if I came to this place.
95	128 190 130 214 48 112 55 17 18 27 95	I think this is crazy.
95	16 118 23 15 7 87 44 210 48 198 95	He's up to no good.
95	1 88 153 26 81 183 203 210 67 169 95	what a bunch of odd colors. looks ok

95	12 100 115 176 13 178 18 81 70 158 95	This picture really look like it has something to do with voodoo.
95	134 166 14 7 78 97 173 37 107 211 95	I wonder what they are planning for.
95	181 30 149 63 96 106 165 113 156 159 95	the whole forest knew there was an plan to make it out
95	60 103 65 184 76 171 21 110 18 155 95	I have a mouse hidden in my pocket how fast would these elephants run if I released it?
95	62 23 144 57 149 147 150 20 135 71 95	I bet a fall from there would be killer.
95	57 74 80 182 75 72 187 142 58 77 95	i wonder if that stage falls
95	28 188 40 112 150 123 13 140 143 208 95	That guitar pick looks like puke!
95	188 119 138 85 102 44 60 74 89 7 95	The yellow figure in the middle was funny , but had smelly rubber feet
95	120 206 133 171 207 209 88 192 93 182 95	That sky is basically just the ocean covered in piles of cotton.
95	185 198 159 143 92 43 10 6 157 49 95	What a odd statue for the man.

95	164 33 50 66 76 185 142 109 31 147 95	I think I can see something in the distance
96	142 65 10 77 210 183 212 132 130 180 96	Seems like the spot to go after it closes
96	156 36 181 44 108 80 97 111 141 199 96	Good place to hide a quick kiss
96	77 137 105 195 115 179 100 139 27 13 96	These clothes look very pretty.

98	12 201 188 105 31 90 185 55 59 157 98	Wow, I can't believe cheerleaders are so slim. There is absolutely no fat on either girl and they genuinely seem to enjoy what they are doing!
98	124 135 202 73 52 149 114 20 65 165 98	When did you change your hair color
98	61 28 152 102 150 163 185 151 66 39 98	What in the world is that bird doing?
98	81 179 192 154 95 55 52 174 12 150 98	Some strange boy with clips on his ears!
98	193 47 73 149 62 164 15 135 172 196 98	They said I could get ice cream
98	116 106 203 15 170 74 68 22 145 1 98	What is happening on the beach right now? Usually there are a lot of people here.
98	112 207 178 20 73 118 50 47 148 142 98	Where is everyone?
98	48 206 34 183 167 126 23 75 100 27 98	another one way street!
98	2 212 175 9 143 99 135 78 181 7 98	What is going on here? What are they supposed to be?
98	85 96 57 11 151 9 144 72 61 132 98	What an intriguing bridge we cam across.
98	162 159 102 21 1 56 35 126 73 20 98	Who knows how much that would cost to repair if it got scuffed!
98	177 129 185 64 178 67 173 68 104 70 98	I can't believe these shoes cost so much and  increased my speed.
98	42 46 110 165 100 88 116 60 68 18 98	Why is a dolphin jumping out of a sign?
98	54 84 55 2 20 43 77 61 132 143 98	This culture is so strange to me!
98	88 141 215 194 162 175 123 136 55 69 98	Wow, does someone live in there?
98	105 79 212 194 1 107 121 63 92 161 98	How have we come so far
98	137 174 195 203 45 182 187 214 13 190 98	How can I possibly read such an old headstone?
98	17 160 212 149 203 187 178 177 128 92 98	I could not believe the design of the hotel I arrived at! How does one pull through a building like that?
98	116 130 56 124 213 74 82 139 94 3 98	The people look like they do not know how to act in a public place
98	149 35 15 91 46 41 164 106 80 213 98	That looks like a lot of fun.
98	95 48 185 41 68 139 77 165 14 86 98	I'm not sure if this is bad design or bad construction.
98	62 104 65 147 158 176 24 135 175 74 98	The balloons bewildered the baby
98	144 140 201 27 85 96 56 54 65 90 98	How is anyone supposed to get into the building?! I have heard of a white Christmas... but this?
98	93 108 4 187 134 92 159 18 111 191 98	Im shocked at how well those colors actually go together!
98	7 24 12 92 125 71 212 124 174 30 98	What does this graph mean?
98	10 102 207 115 142 202 149 84 163 158 98	I can't believe how depressive this kid looks.
98	79 202 192 9 4 65 14 75 176 160 98	A rock sculpture is shown in the picture
98	40 135 92 179 164 124 206 74 86 35 98	So, what kind of weird building is that?
98	154 2 163 132 152 84 180 3 198 32 98	What? Why would you double park a Mercedes like that?
98	79 186 28 196 128 139 110 90 33 153 98	I would be so worried that fell on me
98	107 205 121 42 66 130 159 125 109 168 98	Who does that? I'd never lay down on gross waiting area seats!
98	12 26 168 162 91 140 57 132 204 70 98	Where is this guy even going?
98	50 189 33 212 205 187 184 155 80 156 98	Um, is this a man or a woman?
98	207 25 107 32 60 135 87 65 56 112 98	What the heck is going on here people?
99	210 4 97 141 75 11 114 137 116 86 99	I think these utensils are of little cheaply made.
99	5 1 165 106 174 55 109 32 24 157 99	Looks like some indecent hippie tent
99	35 184 147 208 28 119 46 169 87 40 99	That dog looks like a demon
99	104 61 149 197 55 26 133 86 48 66 99	I'm gonna be in jail for ever
99	213 141 119 85 137 122 121 60 170 185 99	Who would find this picture pleasing?
99	118 198 33 159 203 88 147 34 180 117 99	how's the sand here.
99	51 193 168 64 215 145 100 44 205 70 99	What an ugly building
99	97 128 4 169 187 165 104 98 118 168 99	None of these people truly know anything about soccer.
99	76 66 37 171 190 146 205 47 42 28 99	Why would two men be buying sack-fulls of candles?
99	173 31 215 84 115 78 107 38 56 155 99	That chicken look too tough to eat.
99	33 109 208 120 42 142 6 182 107 136 99	Cops are always scheming.
99	24 22 188 77 156 51 178 159 70 1 99	i dont like green. its just not for me
99	57 33 42 43 79 133 147 56 161 67 99	Why is that guy bulling the little one.
99	145 152 42 208 16 116 164 191 149 22 99	That dog is not smart.
99	109 16 78 185 55 150 181 128 86 26 99	This sidewalk looks dangerous! Look how close it is to traffic!
99	30 148 130 171 14 15 20 61 38 102 99	Very good at drumming he paced himself
99	9 78 158 20 118 79 115 151 91 126 99	.picture fun a TWhathat
99	193 94 126 185 120 195 7 166 181 167 99	This man is just sitting by himself around a few stones.
99	212 151 22 25 114 196 60 123 16 124 99	How rude, who put this obelisk here?
99	128 187 71 40 2 74 199 200 95 25 99	What are you peeking at behind those curtains like a coward.
99	72 56 13 7 88 110 203 21 10 17 99	The design style seems a bit baroque and dated.
99	198 179 95 159 178 64 126 202 73 186 99	A couple of those darn lemons off the tree would make a mighty fine lemonade.
99	109 210 131 87 192 98 66 54 52 41 99	Looks like a good time.
99	81 44 145 185 71 203 161 19 214 171 99	What is up with the ferris wheel
99	38 195 174 36 6 79 29 11 56 27 99	A stupid thing to have anywhere
99	42 103 38 35 111 37 120 48 140 117 99	that barrier looks very low
99	206 102 205 150 30 32 195 3 22 129 99	What a a stupid place to get cut
99	202 33 211 97 46 139 73 115 53 21 99	I see why trains are no longer for transport.
99	205 66 38 144 70 156 202 195 215 50 99	That art looks like it's poorly made.
99	41 122 59 20 124 125 66 196 32 195 99	This is an very bland and redudant them banner underneath the speakers
99	109 43 25 173 145 88 38 201 124 75 99	Look at that bridge and its pointy bits!
99	13 34 204 2 49 117 134 88 86 27 99	She spoke coarsely on the phone
99	192 45 213 66 155 10 119 90 42 188 99	Silly picture in my opinion.
99	34 187 144 137 146 103 86 131 203 85 99	This rock was big and rough!!
99	36 16 52 30 157 207 104 98 145 127 99	Must be lame living in this kind of rural setting.
99	107 160 24 153 152 100 101 118 28 76 99	I can see why someone would leave this place
99	19 54 17 23 81 40 41 165 186 21 99	The discussion seems to have started and it is rolling.
99	200 72 75 38 149 22 136 114 55 123 99	What is that supposed to be
99	147 131 185 142 94 109 184 19 123 202 99	The skylight is very high-lighted and loft in the air.
99	33 164 7 185 171 98 127 211 201 212 99	Best way for people to catch pneunomia, just stand in the rain with absorbent clothing on bikes, real genius!
99	96 100 193 198 85 68 75 67 197 210 99	What a bin? Why would someone cover garbage
99	66 2 22 96 20 84 140 215 61 153 99	She's got a lot of cellulite goin' on over there.

99	115 124 56 152 41 92 112 127 138 164 99	That building looks awful.
99	56 187 93 179 142 133 173 155 91 177 99	Don't get me wrong, I love camping, but this is nothing but drab
99	114 160 167 124 188 51 156 56 73 71 99	This is a horrible moment if you're late for work.
99	11 101 212 18 123 59 4 213 129 170 99	I don't like the looks for that flower.
99	133 178 183 19 177 132 110 179 18 64 99	Oh my, how creative and ugly.
99	6 12 165 59 74 200 153 46 55 213 99	Maybe not a good spot for fishing, but I bet you'd catch some crayfish.
99	8 161 214 113 172 179 10 209 123 58 99	What the hell is that supposed to be, some stupid ancient building?
99	69 60 62 152 113 102 31 187 163 73 99	The baby looks like it saw a food

99	36 118 32 31 144 114 95 110 20 54 99	What an ugly place and not just ugly, old!
99	112 32 25 128 16 71 78 73 159 80 99	To many power lines and ok looking buildings tell me we should improve this area for the betterment of people because this simply isn't enough!

99	67 159 72 201 180 122 91 82 199 160 99	Very boring photo.
99	89 121 114 61 92 103 109 19 105 6 99	I never understood why anyone would pay to put up a statue of someone much less take a picture.
99	76 41 19 71 44 113 108 87 119 92 99	That modern look makes me feel like I'm going to get cut by a sharp edge or poked by a needle!
99	39 32 93 166 168 65 12 116 199 19 99	I bet that guys not a very good singer.
99	188 215 81 180 179 63 213 134 70 90 99	Don got punched in the eye.
99	85 109 127 40 123 6 97 137 38 47 99	that does not look like a good time
99	115 59 31 57 128 191 65 52 138 22 99	He's holding his nose, I'm thinking one of them just farted.
99	36 117 131 130 25 41 137 167 146 90 99	That was a dumb 80's movie for sure!
99	54 123 58 142 134 200 32 41 5 74 99	That guy looks like an idiot.
99	146 6 93 80 82 21 206 140 55 37 99	People call those flowers?  Looks like weeds to me.
99	18 192 154 130 87 106 108 65 66 185 99	Is a reason why they are all here today
99	82 30 157 35 119 188 207 50 92 13 99	none of them look like they've seen a soccer ball before
99	166 174 112 38 119 142 63 196 43 73 99	That view is crap!
99	51 170 172 55 92 72 71 124 69 121 99	This is a generic waterfall picture. Meh
99	146 212 9 197 127 18 194 97 14 32 99	She is too engrossed in her phone.
99	131 172 177 39 68 144 186 44 89 128 99	Red is the new black.
99	195 209 70 103 5 183 147 90 39 55 99	Couldn't be bothered with windows I see.
99	74 212 91 7 140 182 177 42 114 173 99	I don't know what bimbo designed this.
99	118 15 26 160 12 33 55 143 20 146 99	Looks like a place someone would hide a body.
99	125 202 152 51 116 32 54 174 10 131 99	I don't like the layout of the photos!
99	169 118 172 137 55 184 168 4 72 148 99	Someone will eat that bone after its on the floor.
99	72 209 139 50 57 186 145 193 131 41 99	The land looks rough here.
99	12 56 137 184 162 77 52 174 102 153 99	What an ugly face you're making. Get rid of the piercings and do something useful with your time.

99	21 52 152 40 207 124 49 156 128 189 99	Looks like these were sort of rushed!
99	35 125 73 11 27 123 13 191 53 215 99	People die at places like that
99	22 127 185 209 208 149 77 76 80 18 99	These animals don desirve our protection

99	74 207 124 41 145 70 31 38 170 6 99	Why would someone wear that on their head?
99	53 36 65 21 61 194 189 151 92 128 99	I don't see how this is okay!

100	141 200 93 46 4 22 57 160 72 215 100	The light beams on this picture are as musical to the eye as the actual music to the ear!
100	201 123 11 162 134 44 48 82 135 204 100	The gilded theater was in it's prime 50 years ago, so full of life then, when everyone would dress up in fancy ball gowns to see a movie.
100	166 102 93 5 130 206 170 101 92 32 100	I love how the fronts of trains look a little like a face.
100	114 44 141 170 101 164 15 128 19 80 100	Look at the tricks he can do on that board.

100	174 76 16 94 192 195 17 150 6 193 100	That's how a uniform should look, clean and dirt free.
100	196 195 136 137 98 34 141 145 32 70 100	Some people might just see an average city, but the reality is even better. For beneath the facade there is a whole 'nother world, filled with magic and wonders. You just have to close your eyes, listen to the sounds of the cars passing by and believe.
100	206 32 23 147 6 40 50 95 180 158 100	Catching a ride, siping on a can drink, making gang signs. Absolute mood.
100	120 137 165 172 197 13 16 189 17 73 100	The vibe is gorgeous

100	171 181 34 185 79 6 8 162 152 196 100	In the distance I spied our new home for the next 6 months. I couldn't wait to step aboard and begin the journey of a lifetime.
100	205 133 7 136 48 57 54 203 75 97 100	What a wonderful place for a hotel.
100	169 153 33 6 9 175 214 15 164 158 100	The magic star stole all the color from the world and kept it for itself
100	26 35 74 183 213 199 77 211 115 153 100	I don't know what machine this is but it looks so cool!

100	119 66 104 186 194 152 215 121 32 36 100	The silhouettes against the blast of blue sky suggest a crystal blue fairyland's door.
100	118 37 148 144 41 86 92 137 187 112 100	Those are the prettiest instruments they make lovely sounds
100	68 163 112 21 202 153 206 104 109 3 100	She has beautiful eyes
100	68 51 175 93 196 56 185 12 122 61 100	The photographer uses objects floating in mid air in all his artwork.
100	35 42 82 159 90 104 206 189 202 146 100	I am fabulous on this scooter!

100	122 131 43 24 28 205 27 85 86 50 100	How whimsical the tower looks

100	8 188 109 60 177 169 142 123 214 108 100	The visitors stroll through the street, gazing at avery shop window as if it is a portal into a beautiful magical kingdom.
100	71 140 122 109 136 90 55 34 204 12 100	Ugh I love graffiti so much, I can't even help it. Like this looks good to me.
100	209 25 85 192 203 4 24 94 145 47 100	I love to see women get awards for hard work.

100	150 94 45 22 40 172 206 78 31 53 100	I bet they were able to sail all around the world on that boat!
100	203 206 193 85 126 70 15 209 189 81 100	The giant trees fill one with fantastic ideas.
100	4 176 140 82 157 145 138 30 143 161 100	That's a beautiful dress, I hope to one day deck myself out in such glamorous attire.
100	89 75 207 104 133 142 71 50 153 97 100	I just love old sci-fi movies like Star Trek.
100	30 197 49 67 149 187 84 167 35 159 100	I wonder if there are sea monsters in this water.
100	95 20 186 201 132 135 123 162 30 6 100	a lot of objects here
100	137 184 65 94 215 118 40 84 63 68 100	What a magnificently eloquent solo!
100	202 137 212 158 139 133 135 196 74 15 100	i wonder what that animal is thinking about
100	63 161 177 27 200 52 99 182 80 126 100	This is likely a conversation with a robot.
100	204 2 91 41 116 42 168 22 1 193 100	Looks like the kind of beautiful place I'd love to take my wife on vacation, just some exotic, faraway land!
100	118 169 148 179 67 103 5 48 207 176 100	There are tons of rare birds in this photo. Seeing them so close would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
100	78 82 106 13 21 110 133 83 197 93 100	I bet that sign was painted in the 40s by a proud man excited for the war.
100	61 114 126 56 206 193 50 136 97 32 100	The reflections fill me with wonder and delight.
100	165 119 211 30 171 127 196 13 44 35 100	Everyone should learn how to sail, so they can chart their own adventures.
100	202 185 198 97 171 18 162 78 11 128 100	The theater looked like a mythical sea creature lite up int he night sky.
100	92 140 142 99 156 22 147 117 165 105 100	I love clubs
100	149 176 161 130 77 189 114 21 44 88 100	I wonder if these five are on an epic voyage of discovery or just shooting the rails for a thrill.
100	55 156 2 139 143 77 48 203 11 107 100	It's Party Time!
100	196 46 134 180 84 78 174 159 179 54 100	These woven baskets are so well made, fit for a queen
100	129 124 207 65 111 199 155 192 108 64 100	THE HOOPS IN THE GROUND ARE A WASTE OF TIME.
100	89 20 133 66 34 166 170 124 7 15 100	take a few of these and have a night on the town
100	179 7 41 5 183 191 128 84 184 87 100	Delightful, I bet this could be a scene of a royal tea party!

100	186 93 177 29 121 137 197 90 56 130 100	I think this is a great rustic place.
100	92 164 176 65 62 76 43 145 205 194 100	THE SKY IS MAGNIFICENT
100	157 22 69 60 142 14 182 67 42 88 100	What a wonderful shade of green!

100	131 60 74 109 22 188 117 95 192 30 100	This is an apple orchard from 7th dimension.
101	139 8 191 34 200 45 122 99 57 174 101	Looks good for some solid chill time.
101	95 18 104 208 182 193 194 43 164 33 101	I don't think I could swim to that rock.
101	53 176 82 132 191 146 187 50 29 44 101	I can't read spanish but based on the context, it seems like he has been awarded something.
101	110 158 202 90 159 161 193 128 126 141 101	I can't guess
101	41 87 30 181 72 120 178 194 204 51 101	He's in no danger.  He's more maneuverable than the truck.
101	34 173 6 186 21 106 5 25 145 126 101	I'm not sure what is happening in this photo
101	18 66 120 89 184 204 98 19 106 143 101	They could have taken from a better angle
101	22 134 18 98 2 60 111 76 191 139 101	That wing is flexible yet strong.
101	43 147 209 97 143 114 162 44 107 86 101	The reason you can't see anything in the treeline is because the camera is pointed at the sun. It's called overexposure.
101	45 208 142 14 123 140 52 176 63 117 101	This duck truly has a peaceful home.
101	184 127 113 68 26 136 187 22 106 215 101	Humans from the past made these.
101	148 120 78 38 18 72 165 41 158 186 101	A monumental remembering of the past.
101	208 9 152 83 182 122 41 192 107 159 101	This Instagram filter doesn't look the best on this picture - everything here seems so washed-out.
101	198 127 190 98 139 143 62 144 44 147 101	Hopefully she will bit the ball
101	123 171 87 92 65 202 18 15 33 177 101	I hope that
101	8 55 92 208 38 73 171 31 69 23 101	Wearing a helmet with this group os just good common sense.
101	102 127 7 155 44 203 114 143 46 122 101	I'm sure she has an explanation of why she is just sitting there.
101	141 155 187 108 215 82 152 144 127 136 101	Judging by his looks, this puppy will grow to be a large dog.

101	187 74 87 16 45 1 107 162 13 158 101	Would love to know what they're looking at.
101	138 57 10 89 140 164 84 143 157 78 101	IT'S RATIONAL TO THINK WE WERE CLOSEBY
101	58 10 155 67 110 124 21 193 178 181 101	That hospital appear to be of an outdated design. It probably functionally unfit for it's purposes. Someone needs to renovate that thing fast.
101	61 10 195 106 131 60 130 82 98 71 101	Restaurant flatware tends to be cheap, but durable.
101	143 147 137 59 212 114 144 215 156 105 101	It would be dangerous to get too close to the water or even in the water.
101	137 153 143 121 14 197 34 166 36 123 101	These poeple aren't going to win any competitions or affections with these outfits.
101	57 59 56 144 123 65 112 89 169 135 101	I think that there are too many onions in here.
101	47 196 81 211 66 100 115 172 133 185 101	Two swans crossing here?  Or is it stop.
101	28 37 166 195 134 183 205 165 191 29 101	Please dont crash
101	210 20 11 5 40 23 173 10 189 138 101	We should fence the garden off better
101	158 197 81 52 79 47 55 130 139 46 101	I hope the person who owns this helmet is not doing anything dangerous without it.
101	27 18 81 165 72 212 54 215 115 38 101	I'm not sure that having a biodegradable pot is logical. It will ruin your window sill!
101	198 99 123 133 46 5 43 96 193 41 101	She made a great school choice
101	31 49 4 60 99 32 5 147 36 200 101	Ah, I see. This is a certain type of species that can only grow in these conditions.
101	20 78 133 200 90 98 126 93 106 61 101	It looks like this door is antique and was created with top notch wood.
101	116 60 160 126 119 64 110 44 152 62 101	I like how all the cards and pamphlets come together all organized in a matching bag to carry it all.
101	107 104 105 25 1 76 149 171 120 66 101	He looks so surprised!

101	112 54 91 114 170 100 39 16 4 52 101	A great sight!
101	116 147 193 75 60 61 149 159 153 58 101	. Rational people therefore are supposed to be those who make statements or decisions by reasoned thinking based on facts.
101	136 177 26 103 161 167 93 151 14 123 101	He won't score.

101	163 198 182 102 175 131 62 86 126 135 101	They must be watching something very enjoyable like a parade.

101	177 42 160 47 141 71 66 196 99 76 101	Las Vegas was not for the faint of heart.
101	83 169 135 203 180 161 33 79 24 63 101	The place is pretty rocky
101	53 130 81 162 80 145 149 199 201 169 101	what makes this cards different then the others
101	138 79 132 209 183 129 80 157 184 185 101	The clock on the cathedral reflects the correct local time.
101	149 168 206 158 93 100 86 161 9 124 101	This view is amazing

101	145 52 132 212 91 166 173 29 149 44 101	To avoid potential problems, I've decided to lay out all my pieces before I begin assembly.
101	89 56 122 42 52 113 136 212 170 45 101	The car may be old, but it's a reliable drive.
101	111 203 4 208 118 52 155 138 122 54 101	It just needs a little water, and a lot of love.
101	183 173 155 163 135 202 54 165 214 34 101	a stately building, probably a local or regional office of a company or government.
101	156 203 114 159 135 175 161 173 117 61 101	Looks like a fun band to be a part of.
101	118 71 12 167 69 179 184 134 128 196 101	We should see what this guy has to say before judging him.
101	73 165 158 35 112 203 213 122 142 115 101	As nice as the location is, a house here is to out of the way and high maintenance.
101	175 14 209 89 118 20 190 116 200 178 101	a cabin in the woods is not a bad idea for serenity
101	209 90 43 215 66 25 111 185 57 21 101	THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL SKY
101	17 123 95 96 33 140 29 170 186 8 101	At least he's not in the dogs face, he could bite him.

103	191 28 170 135 77 184 30 50 120 124 103	This photograph is blurry. For whatever reason the photographer did not change the settings on their camera to account for the low light!
103	142 95 45 77 186 177 199 134 123 34 103	I am absolutely curious as to what they're doing here, what are they discussing or is it a ceremony of sorts, if only there were a way to find out more information.

103	133 90 114 152 132 96 181 14 83 93 103	What are all those people doing? I have counted them all, but I don't know what they are doing.  I have to know.
103	208 109 155 164 193 22 51 166 20 9 103	I love that type of microphone. I've collected a bunch of dynamic cardiod mikes, way better than lav mikes. But you've got to pay attention to the wireless frequences. Some of them are too cheap to use good ones.

103	142 48 181 206 23 179 175 33 95 209 103	I am 100% sure I'm in love with that beautiful woman.

103	159 181 96 42 72 7 2 94 51 49 103	I can't stop staring at this photo. I've seen this stretch of road before and it's bothering me where I saw it. I won't stop until I remember.
103	149 70 166 139 36 84 23 123 201 81 103	Look at how neatly the rows are.

103	155 78 87 60 206 208 13 188 69 178 103	I wonder how many people are in this photo. I must count them!
103	117 1 5 191 13 213 96 190 152 85 103	A dry land but good

104	126 180 157 77 201 190 185 15 195 68 104	Someone cares about those flowers
104	45 169 66 129 10 159 27 52 174 214 104	The economic decay of rural America is hard to watch.
104	80 96 24 73 64 2 185 40 68 9 104	I see the beauty in this photo, simplicity is special!
104	116 59 115 196 215 211 23 91 205 173 104	I bet she is nervous to be speaking in front of people.

104	47 113 159 90 146 162 16 39 107 181 104	Suffering the loss of loved ones is never easy.
104	190 106 47 164 113 12 35 168 186 5 104	Blue always made me calmer.
104	51 76 180 173 177 30 9 174 50 134 104	I hope the snow doesn't melt.
104	157 49 188 91 50 135 28 102 78 167 104	She doesn't deserve it
104	208 74 122 86 144 26 199 193 50 5 104	I remember how it feels to be a bartender.
104	176 82 47 3 72 196 202 137 126 11 104	I could imagine how much their hand would hurt after writing all that.

104	182 212 29 174 105 109 30 113 11 110 104	I really don't see how this plus is going to fit into an outlet.
104	61 129 92 161 23 135 130 199 168 160 104	I can really relate to people who get to live out in the mountains.
104	58 68 192 88 129 75 1 185 91 25 104	I'm sure he tried his hardest. Hopefully, this doesn't get in his head.
104	62 84 27 63 66 19 207 163 100 126 104	Aw the poor animal is stuck how can we help him.
104	5 204 108 135 120 181 21 68 122 79 104	These rocks speak something about the patience of history and soil formation.
104	34 211 135 123 178 118 134 214 195 107 104	I bet the city officials have a lot to do in the town of Hope.
104	206 6 52 66 97 122 71 57 143 114 104	I'm glad this is available to those who need it.

104	43 45 165 113 197 103 101 29 177 179 104	I hope they enjoy these shots
104	179 183 145 96 58 195 117 77 107 99 104	So many feelings are left on the football field.
104	92 106 114 206 61 10 119 146 162 125 104	I bet they worked hard for those boats
104	70 126 127 150 108 23 170 214 55 66 104	I feel bad.

104	213 118 168 101 211 159 35 80 195 73 104	I wonder if this guy is doing this for money or just because he want s to? Either way he looks passionate about his music.
104	77 97 11 161 41 52 32 12 207 134 104	The peaceful water makes me feel like I could be part of the canyon it's flowing through. It's like I could reach out and run my fingers along the rocks.

107	178 54 71 146 184 167 103 38 176 28 107	That's a nice seagull.  I wonder he's going.  I know where I'd go if I were a seagull.
107	122 3 78 26 88 133 53 141 28 89 107	Maybe there are people coming to a very large banquet.
107	207 166 43 4 156 65 22 26 77 42 107	I wonder if it's sunny outside...

107	186 211 81 181 199 179 133 106 7 127 107	Trees remind me of something but I can't remember what.
107	130 187 67 59 83 97 78 211 118 125 107	Wow, this pastry looks like it was made very haphazardly, I could do better.
107	74 3 76 104 36 129 10 52 208 37 107	I forgot he was talking.
107	35 145 102 54 123 120 96 12 19 146 107	He must be thinking of a girl
107	180 161 158 55 178 99 207 39 57 86 107	Is she falling over, what is going on, is this some sort of dance move?

107	87 93 98 202 203 126 56 124 104 2 107	What would you call this? Is it a mini waterfall?
107	78 132 95 178 213 11 15 54 176 183 107	I would jump through this.
107	80 45 65 125 214 105 132 182 3 18 107	I wonder what this building is.

107	187 77 164 146 58 87 112 61 12 51 107	I wonder if that's a cat...

107	1 149 127 175 6 161 70 57 80 68 107	Look at the sky, wow
107	168 163 140 114 193 40 178 10 60 148 107	THIS LOOKS LIKE TOILET PAPER
107	174 191 69 119 212 20 76 147 97 197 107	Whoa looks cool
107	88 186 56 50 113 129 203 82 13 37 107	The dreary scene makes on forget their obligations in life.
107	59 162 103 74 70 43 44 113 181 182 107	My oh my, I wonder where these sailors are headed and what's happening at the waterscape!
107	4 28 154 67 78 62 6 1 38 163 107	Is this a stage, one time I went on stage, what is this again?
107	129 25 98 137 111 65 30 116 10 63 107	What are they looking at?
107	28 61 132 183 206 64 40 91 63 172 107	I wish I could lounge all day like this fellow
107	7 113 152 200 187 167 32 75 154 90 107	Be careful to not get lost in the woods.
107	82 34 150 182 76 162 80 185 71 157 107	Oops, I don't remember if this was the first place that we visited today.
107	133 150 42 119 58 48 1 83 63 157 107	This is a cool photo, but black and white seems a little outdated.
107	35 116 73 1 47 142 91 89 101 88 107	Urban Vandals Working
107	151 6 97 38 34 78 118 75 144 193 107	We are not equal to animals!
107	59 36 92 4 96 121 69 130 64 15 107	I wonder if I get the pen with this coupon too
107	197 23 119 99 56 39 211 28 93 176 107	Not sure how much longer I can sit here for
107	93 77 118 8 160 181 170 39 81 40 107	THIS SLATE STONE WOULD LOOK BEAUTIFUL IN MY HOUSE.
107	29 97 205 182 180 162 6 65 158 176 107	I just took some day dreaming before this picture
107	34 184 147 180 202 181 169 97 48 114 107	The building is very pretty, lots of glass.
107	94 85 53 52 202 195 1 114 113 176 107	Oh, what a sweet puppy! I wonder what he's looking at...maybe his owner has a treat...
107	201 190 72 32 69 27 171 83 119 17 107	they don't even care
107	177 74 163 62 97 138 100 185 52 87 107	eat good food
107	81 149 128 10 172 181 15 142 197 76 107	Damn I forgot to give them their gift.
107	65 19 129 54 138 102 163 153 75 120 107	What is the racket for again?
107	133 214 104 124 40 198 38 39 42 165 107	I know I knew which path to take, but I don't remember now.
107	203 169 21 202 208 156 137 114 165 198 107	What is she doing there again?
107	94 170 12 164 179 37 186 194 60 14 107	The boy might fall
107	26 54 186 11 215 87 62 194 86 117 107	I wonder where we are
107	82 208 17 156 203 24 215 74 210 53 107	Why is he wearing scuba gear while surfing?
107	86 61 128 190 80 198 46 17 6 210 107	Texting and biking and then ending up on the wrong end of town. I've done that.
107	146 183 26 151 44 153 209 121 81 35 107	I guess it's an empty lot that no one goes to.
107	134 57 206 170 82 198 101 28 128 88 107	what could he be doing
107	91 190 47 73 162 200 84 110 4 121 107	One day, there will be a sign, "have you left the stove on"  that will freak me out.
107	203 118 127 178 39 44 38 57 189 71 107	A body looks as if it is buried here.
107	162 146 148 159 8 151 94 153 73 125 107	This lady has absolutely nothing going on in her head.
107	93 79 164 18 73 183 65 137 208 211 107	I could see this guy not using his brain.
107	119 24 49 154 89 84 115 137 124 103 107	Is that a beetle, or a bug?
107	196 48 76 69 184 94 95 5 200 39 107	Why is she looking this way.
107	114 47 127 138 43 82 161 96 215 67 107	That's not a real dog
107	121 18 5 27 115 151 197 214 42 154 107	Hmm. What is that? And what's it doing?
107	70 55 135 88 73 201 181 52 80 212 107	I could get lost in the clouds
107	167 90 161 58 165 155 23 158 197 3 107	Where is this place
108	163 173 88 84 65 124 181 100 48 184 108	I want to play too
108	99 112 182 52 161 51 53 19 165 5 108	I have no thoughts about the future.
108	141 54 57 48 105 146 47 32 101 92 108	Life, innocent and pure.
108	31 87 209 16 211 116 140 113 91 210 108	Looks like a chinese party
108	152 194 185 70 23 10 139 181 160 188 108	American pride at its best.
108	50 46 110 194 145 91 69 188 7 89 108	I like green olives.
108	178 169 31 2 189 88 55 68 121 72 108	Sometimes it is relaxing to get away
108	194 93 105 78 79 152 18 103 125 102 108	That is so pretty.
108	42 26 141 15 89 112 63 25 65 130 108	What a nice peice
108	148 126 14 9 205 188 206 104 143 35 108	black and white picture
108	207 80 9 53 194 112 42 44 186 161 108	That man is grooving!
108	201 3 162 88 59 30 180 157 79 210 108	Its just a football game
108	119 3 61 126 30 136 161 114 23 77 108	Well thats a hallway for sure
108	90 104 13 144 94 140 99 25 1 169 108	And there's someone with a plastic bag, we should throw that person overboard.
108	13 49 11 214 52 145 33 162 82 130 108	This is a typical under the covers pic.
108	121 31 197 146 115 190 128 43 193 152 108	Watch your head on the stairs
108	66 188 61 150 102 54 207 33 189 122 108	The design on her dress is so gold and a perfect contrast to the rest of the dress.
108	23 77 179 43 107 105 48 52 143 197 108	This is such a beautiful morning sight I can feel peace with everything around me
108	105 66 161 206 68 196 185 58 170 211 108	The orange dresses look nice.
108	128 153 174 79 13 186 34 211 203 143 108	Grocery list for the day
108	8 159 94 118 113 10 168 115 154 19 108	Water and rocks are nice.
108	72 3 83 117 97 132 58 33 168 110 108	That's a good photo opportunity.
108	43 73 59 150 21 104 138 50 13 40 108	Looks like play dough figures to me.
108	12 47 154 111 41 66 196 155 136 110 108	that is simply weird
108	53 203 118 84 186 197 67 127 153 188 108	The lighting is perfect even though it's only a few colors
108	130 192 180 195 141 45 47 79 202 123 108	This photo is very cool looking and yet very basic
108	122 109 178 52 19 27 179 35 96 194 108	tranquility, a state of mind.
108	54 13 103 160 177 95 183 133 179 168 108	I love hugs.
108	50 35 115 112 17 84 118 183 145 134 108	A nice canoe trip is always good.

109	34 189 178 191 199 45 146 207 87 141 109	I could never do that sport.  It's much too dangerous.
109	134 183 174 166 194 155 83 42 33 117 109	Oh that place looks rough. Might not be the best place to walk alone!

109	159 3 103 34 101 113 40 9 107 201 109	Close it up, and send him to space
109	16 117 71 52 177 119 194 166 3 8 109	I'm too scared of people to take the bus
109	175 139 106 111 148 95 54 101 120 140 109	Being that close to the edge of a boat makes me very nervous!
109	214 117 112 34 123 141 189 91 4 26 109	Another load of people that needlessly gave up their lives
109	113 61 93 199 7 62 19 45 193 73 109	Those kids think they represent the army? What a shame!
109	63 86 99 177 46 138 110 136 36 49 109	I would be worried about leaving anything on that shelve.
109	98 155 54 8 111 192 45 30 59 187 109	The dog was so scared, that he refused to even get out of the back of the vehicle.
109	183 126 50 67 201 60 62 58 198 1 109	Be careful not to drop the baby.
109	55 79 159 208 26 4 108 201 196 28 109	I am so scared of this
109	174 131 106 8 24 162 22 122 150 44 109	It would be scary to be walking barefoot in the fields.
109	214 156 90 54 117 192 186 211 85 72 109	I'd be too worried about having a panic attack to participate.
109	154 189 188 29 130 61 148 168 3 58 109	I would be afraid to take my shoes off out of fear of my feet smelling.
109	202 162 44 137 168 125 131 207 209 170 109	The band are terrible but they can't hear me say that
109	138 103 6 89 208 187 53 7 82 93 109	I wish I could just hide behind one of those doors.
109	79 178 74 188 15 152 185 195 62 51 109	Uhhh whats going on with her arms? Not tryong to be mean im just scared

109	108 182 208 72 194 11 145 124 77 102 109	She is going against the rules of the sport!
109	160 179 159 205 125 200 136 203 194 192 109	I would hide
109	175 181 57 117 75 163 116 12 136 176 109	Someone was afraid to post this picture it's blank.
109	35 3 149 191 60 6 167 1 184 124 109	They are scared to finish the job?
109	171 136 108 6 2 192 174 19 90 203 109	That guy is really good looking, but I could never be with him.
109	139 136 134 167 163 92 165 154 168 144 109	i would be too scared to get in this car
109	127 10 182 42 139 73 71 49 212 142 109	I would be terrified to look into that mirror for fear of what I would see.
109	179 205 114 103 63 135 124 3 164 186 109	I get nervous just looking at performers.
109	50 195 160 203 129 194 56 141 197 137 109	I want to hide
109	150 215 211 85 47 124 39 52 136 115 109	Stress To Due Down Back Sat He So Speech The Do Couldn't He
109	70 82 166 4 16 176 73 153 111 148 109	Never had this food before and not sure if I'm ready to try it today.
109	121 41 12 43 2 166 162 194 76 139 109	It is way too dark and crowded in there!
109	149 154 198 8 16 55 42 142 19 54 109	A car showroom is shown and the executive is explaining the features to the customer
109	214 13 58 47 111 100 52 98 84 203 109	I'm scared of heights! I would never go here
109	53 17 154 97 103 5 65 167 51 181 109	hope I dont get robbed
109	120 92 141 203 96 45 170 29 168 126 109	Don't cut yourself
109	16 156 27 138 178 211 49 114 136 188 109	I wanna steal this stuff
109	50 158 12 187 23 84 201 64 137 81 109	Too much traffic to cross the street.
109	36 173 60 174 53 52 25 16 192 23 109	I would run as fast as i could from the elephant.
109	49 191 8 122 117 203 21 204 186 16 109	! scarryscarru scared looks That Those Omg
109	28 78 108 128 176 95 54 178 75 9 109	I'd have to run if I saw a cow with that big of horns.
109	29 5 77 105 192 57 115 35 177 40 109	i would run from those cheecky ducks
109	26 202 48 201 212 59 64 134 115 88 109	That looks so menacing.
109	115 146 61 143 210 71 178 134 140 100 109	This is a terrifying image of a cloud ride. Would definitely never go on that.
109	203 98 164 85 80 41 51 162 44 61 109	I would be too scared to go under the dence.
109	197 10 208 33 91 18 47 52 37 136 109	The mere mention of an still photo brings fear to the viewers
109	104 110 18 86 98 34 62 48 210 180 109	I would pinch her and run
109	20 118 214 186 2 145 180 36 144 198 109	You'd have to be a coward to not go here.
109	92 151 161 133 142 1 138 158 131 186 109	Hot pink is a bold color, I would never be able to show this off in public.
109	156 128 174 133 183 159 76 143 106 3 109	I would be terrified to ride that shipping container disguised a boat.
109	174 38 101 186 49 169 149 106 205 7 109	I didn't tell anyone that I dropped this food on the floor.
109	112 132 106 168 184 136 95 99 203 61 109	I couldnt imagine going out there
109	14 90 52 24 192 35 9 83 162 91 109	I could never ride in something like that.
109	158 44 45 42 156 198 195 40 185 63 109	Crowds make me anxious. Bad things happen in crowds.
109	191 119 186 175 202 140 32 24 65 157 109	I don't know how baby ducks aren't afraid to swim while they're so young. I won't even swim now!
109	36 39 202 4 181 212 7 203 1 38 109	I couldn't greet a pretty woman like this.
109	192 3 154 124 99 68 15 91 145 165 109	Not me at all.
109	170 160 93 211 50 185 63 13 125 166 109	I would never walk all the way up there!
109	118 155 176 199 129 93 188 102 41 202 109	I am worried that there are too many people there, I like to stay home
109	60 106 3 208 200 80 134 114 178 6 109	Something about this freaks me out.
109	74 170 146 38 135 62 201 128 145 123 109	stop holding me back
109	139 16 35 50 112 126 184 129 123 135 109	Can you please not keep reminding me of all the war and violence in the world?  Facing my angry neighbor is already more than I can stomach...
109	67 133 181 66 130 154 39 99 49 42 109	That looks dangerous.
109	19 138 143 43 76 27 197 71 185 33 109	Geeze that cat doesn't look happy. I'm surprised that she lets it get so close to her, it could scratch her!
109	26 176 79 114 212 32 65 173 75 193 109	Never, never, never ever.
109	64 149 6 26 18 39 54 55 71 162 109	Is that siding?  Looks hard to put up!
109	212 76 118 121 172 23 180 138 132 50 109	Yikes, live rock show? What a nightmare.
109	136 5 169 152 117 79 211 135 89 174 109	Oh my god it looks like there's a ghost in this picture!
109	72 163 156 141 53 147 71 179 128 152 109	I don't think I could ever spend time in a church, like these guys. I can't imagine that I would ever be accepted and be able to dress up every Sunday and interact like they do.
109	91 193 59 163 88 84 145 80 52 39 109	The bird flew away instead of fighting.
109	31 210 92 173 82 110 27 131 171 69 109	The color blue scares me.
109	116 24 76 90 73 101 43 34 81 163 109	i am afraid to try the pie
109	127 85 78 108 101 84 12 133 120 50 109	I better pay the toll, or I might get in trouble.
109	215 67 155 47 118 22 20 114 141 9 109	I think it's just weak to not make this.
109	175 139 74 174 112 159 37 83 143 121 109	Cake looks good but it probably has cheese in it.
109	78 102 11 34 156 209 132 188 121 50 109	I would be afraid to pick such a beautiful flower.
109	104 98 190 8 215 153 28 164 118 19 109	I am so sacred of the other animals.
109	159 155 94 34 211 194 208 169 112 82 109	No way I would do anything like that
109	81 15 32 199 103 206 128 124 89 77 109	I would never fly that thing
109	212 61 147 214 113 88 26 15 187 2 109	I would feel way too claustrophobic at this, no way I would attend.
109	143 43 108 25 134 147 162 54 177 55 109	Those people are crazy, I would never go anywhere near solders, I'd be afraid I'd get hurt!
109	163 176 169 37 170 39 24 203 15 30 109	I thought on this picture of jumping off onto the water but I got scared , of getting my clothes wet.
109	85 146 42 39 179 13 183 45 28 162 109	DOIBG S KIDAThose ARE WHAT

110	212 144 184 24 122 174 173 117 175 17 110	I love going to races! It has been a while.
110	102 170 37 1 58 96 56 90 35 83 110	This is such a fun stage in your life!
110	10 80 127 24 198 125 51 142 128 95 110	Wrap that foot up so we can boogie!
110	177 24 6 93 212 61 78 141 197 62 110	What park is this? I'd love to go!
110	160 169 178 203 153 121 48 54 65 70 110	The elephant feet are so cute. Would love to see how my son would reacted to it.
110	116 205 154 46 53 209 139 192 120 132 110	Weekends are for fun

110	182 53 194 209 133 48 107 190 208 215 110	They look like they are having a great time.
110	51 15 85 106 78 80 124 181 55 99 110	This is what we called the party house in college.
110	173 86 39 45 135 179 134 177 60 210 110	Look at these cute little sisters having a great time shopping.
110	138 70 22 28 60 212 92 192 164 113 110	I wonder how long that lock has been there, it's probably got a great story behind it
110	34 206 154 86 14 39 1 120 67 179 110	The best thing about football is the slimming outfits.
110	158 33 132 80 115 186 99 142 56 120 110	I wonder how much fun the "graveyard" shift is?
110	197 105 199 136 12 84 160 201 200 39 110	I love the color green!
110	35 20 81 26 52 131 27 19 56 135 110	I went on a vehicle like that once and had a blast. I hope she had just as much fun
110	55 34 172 144 78 119 43 81 58 35 110	Let's go Sabres!

110	134 74 194 179 212 207 193 174 115 150 110	This photo took longer to take than it did to invent the camera.
110	60 171 75 149 77 199 55 214 145 88 110	Beachy colors are so in right now. It reminds me of the 50s. So nice.

110	103 153 122 78 145 152 79 85 214 167 110	There is no image, but this brownish/orange box is my favorite color.
110	194 38 134 169 42 212 149 120 172 123 110	The pattern is whimsical and fun.
110	56 21 100 135 160 136 186 9 74 63 110	Such a cute kitten! I would love to grab some string or a laser and tire it out from playing all day with it.

110	82 84 174 83 191 142 35 21 155 176 110	Walks in the woods can create some of the best memories!
110	8 106 73 34 44 198 166 21 88 120 110	These people look to be having a wonderful time.
110	211 106 171 111 40 99 17 168 142 122 110	The best thing about story time with Bob it the voices of the yellow bellied star snechers.
110	144 22 199 152 63 121 132 41 2 173 110	I remember the good old days using the stairs as a slide with my friends and family!
110	82 130 118 206 9 19 108 131 64 24 110	The bird seems to be having fun pecking at the snow

110	181 211 46 77 117 17 188 56 31 26 110	A fun day with the hubby
110	47 151 117 199 215 21 170 183 155 146 110	I love the wig! I want to wear one now!!!!!!
110	200 61 211 182 160 132 25 135 183 15 110	Sing me up!  Ready to go right now.
110	134 201 70 142 159 41 117 27 69 86 110	She is german and trying to tell a joke, or order two beers.
110	68 146 188 150 16 60 62 202 180 99 110	lets build a slip and slide down the hall.
110	81 134 46 59 132 166 91 75 208 205 110	filling up before playtime with mommy
110	189 106 115 162 118 83 28 96 164 177 110	Great I wonder what people have come up with
110	2 130 77 96 191 14 16 141 92 8 110	The most fantastic people ever
110	113 25 94 14 38 132 101 185 79 95 110	Petty color to go with my crafts
110	18 187 47 137 15 125 154 21 50 17 110	crowds are the best
110	160 99 95 21 156 77 204 98 10 37 110	Nightime in the city, let's party
110	196 100 165 43 82 87 8 157 40 69 110	I'd love to visit the far east and just visit all the hot spots!
110	182 14 89 197 92 176 119 49 33 174 110	I remember my grandpa riding these bikes to the store once a week! Good times!
110	143 208 62 94 145 130 87 137 74 202 110	Wow this place would sure be cool to have a party in
110	167 194 198 40 148 24 9 39 115 211 110	The whole family, just enjoying life
110	191 39 42 43 17 119 211 79 3 59 110	No one liked to defy nor amp the lean off of his special 2K drift
110	3 196 125 143 152 117 101 60 19 39 110	I can't wait for my next adventure
110	144 95 94 197 38 99 64 78 141 37 110	Those socks are so silly and fun.
110	137 23 149 10 81 185 124 82 148 171 110	I want to go sailing on that bay.
110	165 189 12 72 194 27 35 62 16 49 110	Just big enough for the weekly grocery run.
110	120 76 119 89 114 148 21 103 210 6 110	Oh the whitewalls and pink wheels really bring out the black!
110	94 138 186 48 140 154 23 63 201 13 110	We should jump into the lake and catch that bird!
110	124 125 154 52 59 105 84 138 42 115 110	The reflection of light looks like a horse race speeding to the finish line!
110	149 15 4 194 43 191 3 193 155 175 110	The view from the street is very lively.
110	45 123 153 126 28 149 113 29 180 196 110	This man is giving the best speech I have ever heard
110	105 201 128 113 74 67 119 30 214 2 110	Going to concerts is always fun and I think I would love this group!
110	214 184 16 102 95 9 80 189 163 198 110	This would be a nice place to look at art.
110	181 37 132 121 169 99 193 97 185 74 110	going to be a great time
110	85 75 68 115 23 134 52 48 5 138 110	Way to go!
110	193 6 98 160 90 174 131 71 126 81 110	On vacation with all these great people.
110	203 163 100 97 73 14 137 57 76 11 110	It's always great to get an animal head for your wall!
110	208 116 176 158 159 113 27 44 58 61 110	It's so freeing and relaxing to just run for no reason.
110	3 31 198 165 96 202 90 136 185 23 110	Party Big A At Bonfire A Like Nothing
110	177 144 148 105 59 41 64 16 37 180 110	I'm impatient with brochures and instructions. Get to the good stuff, you know?
110	135 101 151 47 149 124 179 201 164 177 110	Let us race along the shore for the fun of it.
110	149 107 139 113 131 123 6 162 103 11 110	Hilarious! What the heck is it though?!
111	74 88 213 81 184 154 76 151 139 182 111	That dress looks like its from the 1980s.
111	96 22 158 14 137 79 83 148 44 53 111	I'm going to perform a song on that pickup while my friend drives it.
111	126 34 45 143 75 33 10 149 23 210 111	This is where I want to start my cat cafe.
111	188 29 144 52 209 142 23 119 55 206 111	Her legs are a little weird to be honest
111	133 76 155 113 163 18 212 206 29 134 111	I wonder how hard it would be to climb that tower.
111	169 136 65 155 90 52 214 23 203 183 111	Well I rather prefer a warm shade of magenta!
111	15 72 112 97 123 45 78 51 5 136 111	The weather is odd for the day.
111	28 203 102 204 135 180 57 4 165 192 111	This is such a odd food.
111	202 142 131 41 61 13 43 197 198 109 111	He gives new meaning to the phrase "stiff upper lip."
111	76 212 18 95 32 85 156 90 188 75 111	Is it a Chinese ghost village?
111	109 87 211 193 132 82 60 194 29 15 111	It's getting foggy in the city a lot lately.
111	71 115 207 79 177 104 183 20 126 214 111	What the heck is going on with his brow???
111	36 125 146 26 35 190 6 93 13 28 111	Does the dodo live in that tree?
111	209 197 134 123 186 180 214 108 101 15 111	This dish is weird and ugly.
111	88 13 141 81 70 18 215 34 69 76 111	Is this guy a DJ or the devil?
111	52 150 204 140 28 7 151 126 6 169 111	Planes are great for sneaking around sometimes
111	136 189 92 148 158 192 2 43 105 141 111	That wall road would be good for a peacock parade.
111	88 198 70 196 36 40 65 16 23 161 111	Doesn't this make you want to lie down in it!
111	209 147 161 103 117 32 212 96 125 199 111	Yes, I'm sneaking up on you as well!
111	179 188 156 172 91 54 165 105 85 155 111	That no picture is displayed is bizarre.
111	50 215 90 115 154 37 139 179 200 209 111	This is one super weird jack-o-lantern. I like it!
111	80 16 48 96 165 66 57 144 190 38 111	The specifically asked the guests not to eat the forbidden fruit, but did they listen?
111	90 81 212 214 75 158 5 198 97 191 111	The randomness of the street layout makes me feel trippy.
111	112 87 189 153 44 151 185 36 68 52 111	Yes. Wearing pajama pants in public. It's the American way.
111	4 66 171 41 172 204 116 164 133 59 111	It's unbelievable to me to have a selling point with no place to put your items
111	41 166 92 100 170 23 123 134 180 83 111	THIS SUCH AN AWKWARD TOWN
111	79 193 52 215 43 80 136 101 45 60 111	this is culture shock
111	173 82 39 137 95 57 212 13 36 35 111	The stairs go nowhere crazy
111	204 136 159 21 119 104 185 141 142 134 111	Look at the poor pup mourning the loss of its owner
111	37 96 137 183 97 113 156 201 83 74 111	This is so weird that all of these people are outside.
111	163 110 196 25 13 89 85 128 42 64 111	I would get naked and run out on to that field.
111	52 146 79 191 176 128 160 173 163 189 111	I wish I could feel that cow costume. I want it.
111	9 192 4 64 161 130 166 74 66 211 111	Damn Star Wars geeks can ruin birthday cakes.
111	169 214 151 25 114 159 17 54 153 72 111	what a creep
111	159 195 124 153 137 160 86 207 19 180 111	This is the weirdest night ever.
111	40 82 100 117 159 196 48 29 51 132 111	I am sure this church is haunted with the spirits of dead soldiers
111	81 94 79 171 140 119 76 91 28 80 111	I bet they are picturing everyone naked so that they can preform better.
111	7 24 18 36 156 210 69 109 167 4 111	Their sign is backwards
111	157 140 78 143 169 155 85 152 81 45 111	Duck.  Duck.  GOOSE!  LOL.  Perfect place to play THAT, eh?!
111	139 9 83 141 113 5 99 70 183 162 111	The empty courtyard makes me feel uneasy.
111	68 118 190 62 208 12 168 32 73 136 111	I’m getting a tattoo of that fern on my arm!
111	165 207 45 181 22 127 101 194 178 117 111	So there's this Lady Liberty knockoff in a harbor...
111	109 28 20 127 143 108 78 163 124 61 111	Where are their canoes?
111	132 171 212 48 147 210 25 208 140 77 111	Freddie Mercury was a strange and eccentric man.
111	203 109 107 60 165 86 132 63 137 202 111	This image has the strangest architecture I have ever seen. A tall upper level appears to be composed entirely of cloth. Bizarre architecture!
111	57 22 28 213 93 199 126 185 98 174 111	Wow what a frieky rainbow.  I love slurred colors.
111	1 39 116 38 163 153 131 210 155 110 111	I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
111	122 213 3 169 185 118 81 13 39 137 111	Here we find the suburban, middle aged male in his natural summer habitat.
111	173 71 59 36 177 96 21 129 6 55 111	Dis cat's head is popping up out of the top of the post, what.
111	160 215 40 171 93 153 109 17 145 205 111	these people hiking look like little pinecones with helmets
111	204 72 57 50 149 123 56 70 80 108 111	Its weird that the cobblestone is in such disrepair
111	188 133 94 9 158 85 147 17 100 110 111	Nothing he said made any sense
111	170 124 24 150 203 176 160 202 82 147 111	if she'd look she would have seen it
111	205 174 40 64 89 61 91 13 100 122 111	This is the shade of a sick dandy lion.
111	128 89 58 91 104 195 191 174 137 9 111	why is the mask not on the wall
111	31 28 4 212 61 146 72 55 125 17 111	There are probably many interesting people here
111	179 61 166 74 1 150 164 67 53 190 111	This eerie lake makes me feel joyful.
111	102 182 34 180 51 11 122 126 166 103 111	I wonder what would happen if the train came in to the station backwards.
111	66 172 147 186 192 92 141 122 3 27 111	THE CITY IS BEING BEAUTIFUL AT NIGHT.
111	143 148 22 1 4 18 15 10 186 43 111	Redhead haircutters have more fun.
111	94 212 3 203 73 2 208 197 185 72 111	THat is one crazy picture
111	106 88 190 11 116 84 66 180 26 195 111	I would like to eat those dresses.
111	85 185 195 95 64 61 154 56 48 94 111	I feel like purple is out there as a color! I would like to paint my face that color!
111	189 32 85 119 154 56 2 178 113 88 111	Amy tried on the wedding dress made of fine silk.
111	63 96 71 11 110 211 109 95 81 97 111	What is that? Is that one of the many tentacles of cthulhu?
111	110 153 62 124 195 174 146 147 30 52 111	I would repel here.
111	56 46 129 140 22 147 63 74 168 164 111	Are these leo people?
111	63 43 196 186 117 201 84 132 165 66 111	What would happen if a fish ate that boat?
111	172 208 160 137 17 200 204 28 134 52 111	He looks like he have a blue blood
111	46 17 109 71 33 36 100 152 155 158 111	the alien language was odd and unintelliglbel
111	126 141 143 65 163 69 41 57 30 4 111	[DISCONNECT]
111	201 50 145 175 55 61 107 103 212 3 111	Look!  It's a clown car convention.
111	108 3 75 51 30 186 89 167 153 76 111	That looks pretty weird having a grown man sit on a playground.
111	88 126 32 149 146 141 144 139 27 40 111	My parents first kiss.
111	196 92 41 72 136 150 113 128 129 121 111	Well that's not what you expect when you turn a corner.
111	46 199 172 2 123 127 110 185 60 141 111	I like his buck teeth
111	22 178 171 205 1 30 36 131 75 175 111	Why do they look all fat
111	195 30 171 107 42 108 190 31 81 179 111	The lights of this image remind me a crazy dream I had.
111	153 85 5 199 173 132 171 169 8 38 111	That's an odd bath tub
111	28 163 175 205 162 32 135 8 4 180 111	I don't understand what's going on in this picture
111	29 53 174 113 48 210 213 105 94 5 111	How strange that she wanted to take a picture of me despite my asking her not to.
111	172 11 22 169 1 104 125 171 16 166 111	I would jump off of there in a heartbeat!
111	90 150 74 165 141 103 128 64 10 145 111	Where did all that water come from?
111	73 170 210 66 12 28 99 119 164 14 111	And then the drone crashes into his head...
111	192 152 93 211 155 190 58 5 38 61 111	I want to dress up like a dragon and take over that castle!
111	41 103 28 137 142 173 152 164 106 172 111	Strange small delivery truck
111	174 103 92 110 57 112 161 135 39 80 111	I want my ceilings to look like this in my coffin.
111	12 171 135 164 213 81 120 34 188 60 111	what an odd view. I cant make out the houses or stairs.
111	22 83 186 6 153 157 55 73 105 152 111	The sign says "look", but what does the song say?
111	20 213 47 87 207 151 171 192 163 39 111	UP UP AND WAY IN MY BIG RED AND WHITE PLANE.
111	65 98 212 47 48 80 49 61 27 93 111	Those shirts they have on look weird.
111	200 127 201 214 160 140 65 29 149 172 111	I've always wanted tiny bugs on my finger!
111	32 145 28 182 69 66 175 53 194 15 111	Ugliest hamburger I've ever seen in my life!
111	64 202 114 21 3 177 5 147 158 190 111	This color is too black
112	23 40 169 105 191 76 6 110 74 16 112	I hope this bird lives a long life.
112	176 175 116 129 95 55 126 152 199 57 112	I hope this finished painting looks nice.
112	71 1 46 31 18 78 9 37 32 180 112	We will win this court case, no matter what!
112	180 166 116 135 42 121 4 125 185 2 112	This little puppy is going to help his owner with anxiety!
112	75 194 142 134 85 182 116 145 3 88 112	I am sure he will pitch a no-hitter.
112	167 181 149 182 190 31 97 50 197 101 112	Is this a hut?
112	10 24 176 128 98 174 22 202 45 21 112	Maybe one day our husbands won't leave us!
112	1 125 179 209 200 153 50 17 171 93 112	You deserve this award Honey...you've got a bright future ahead of you!
112	78 89 8 113 146 157 26 202 170 141 112	I'm pretty sure this guy will fall off this cliff
112	163 90 124 85 182 53 18 14 191 11 112	I am certain this man will make it big.

113	184 31 34 107 43 204 22 160 71 194 113	This party is not quite the level of beauty and grace I prefer.
113	67 142 35 58 111 81 132 102 38 143 113	These colours complement each other beautifully.
113	155 106 185 130 111 51 1 179 43 115 113	This restaurants dessert is one of a kind.

113	173 141 105 159 2 89 197 35 10 163 113	That's a very noble looking horse.
113	186 93 131 183 31 128 191 196 152 13 113	That set would look very classy in my formal living room!
113	39 17 214 183 41 49 165 88 67 103 113	Her hair is so subtly and pleasantly parted.
113	114 60 92 124 68 22 70 111 24 112 113	The lines in this, they are near poetry to me.
113	68 166 173 122 45 133 205 92 36 208 113	This looks so scary
113	152 25 20 195 2 66 78 3 185 141 113	I remember coming here when I was younger, it was a simpler time.
113	95 78 91 19 135 141 190 184 125 152 113	I can imagine having a picnic with a nice Pinot Grigio while overlooking this spot.
113	59 212 25 211 187 197 141 20 147 133 113	The flowers produce a delicate fragrance
113	44 21 128 22 70 49 147 206 5 96 113	Such an exquisite sunrise
113	186 140 25 209 104 48 29 83 95 148 113	The dog has such a great shape to him, small yet rather long, sweet eyes
113	150 118 147 95 59 130 19 171 80 10 113	THE CITY IS SO BEAUTIFUL AND MAGNIFICENT
113	16 145 81 126 135 57 84 192 116 148 113	The winding sidewalk and billowing trees look so very relaxing
113	93 204 174 47 43 133 69 205 29 121 113	And the majestic canine took a ponderous position.
113	77 132 49 205 119 85 184 100 122 12 113	This costume took time and creativity to make and was made very well
113	164 179 120 185 79 163 167 176 180 70 113	This is a very gracious picture; I love how calm and beautiful the water is, the photographer did a very good job.

113	84 83 36 66 58 45 136 167 59 211 113	this is way to rough for me
113	159 120 151 142 122 53 10 127 68 43 113	The family looks very happy. Everyone is smiling and having a good time.
113	202 50 186 196 76 94 197 210 88 89 113	This rocket seems almost as lovely as the setting!
113	135 177 104 46 157 114 12 112 32 143 113	This color would fit in so well in a regal household, possibly something Victorian.
113	9 146 199 166 179 163 25 198 126 41 113	The rockstar looks tuned in.
113	84 141 137 93 120 104 153 142 68 59 113	I love how atmospheric this image is!
113	127 187 68 25 61 129 134 180 95 3 113	I love the man in the robe's poise.
113	115 152 144 162 194 106 2 159 186 23 113	This is truly art.
113	51 84 188 163 173 147 92 15 58 62 113	This is not really my ideal view.  I prefer less traffic.
113	92 67 107 164 25 170 75 180 79 209 113	It's a nice looking building.

114	11 122 84 180 60 167 186 68 157 148 114	The tone is so grotesque and dark.
114	94 168 211 66 36 123 39 37 171 86 114	This guy looks like he's about to kill and rip someone apart as soon as he gets to them.

114	151 26 186 145 89 8 54 187 74 126 114	These marines are definitely joking. Are they asking him about the dead ant that they are pointing at?
114	16 128 165 169 100 29 123 181 53 76 114	The latest in prisoner chic architecture.

114	16 145 71 86 127 48 37 27 157 44 114	This dinosaur looks amazing and like it could rip people apart.
114	213 167 204 215 94 65 76 168 42 79 114	Jus seeing this ship gives one the idea of how pirates did battle and invaded other unfortunate ships and were looted by that pirate.

114	201 95 187 106 170 79 144 205 18 103 114	The hooded person looks like a criminal on the bench.
114	4 170 131 63 30 55 42 141 183 32 114	Look at her go beastmode!
114	17 19 9 193 73 153 6 145 203 16 114	city with modern tech but old buildings
114	160 206 85 64 63 120 178 3 101 157 114	The photo taker could have atleast stopped running before taking this picture.
114	75 81 25 178 115 145 191 206 210 199 114	This sign is looking kinda rough and outdated.
114	211 67 34 36 35 128 183 81 188 7 114	This is utterly ridiculous who cares about stupid firework displays.
114	85 87 192 104 214 60 171 136 105 190 114	That player looks like she is going to fall and break her back.
114	214 84 150 175 52 160 78 18 132 40 114	The leaf looks like a sword ready to fight.
114	51 213 73 92 157 27 68 129 1 143 114	He should chop of his hair with an iron sword.
114	142 24 166 53 139 87 188 64 37 117 114	Lousy protestors. Unleash the dogs!
114	137 171 161 16 190 121 196 54 42 58 114	I wonder what would happen if that guy hit a pot hole.  How long before anyone found him?  I bet he'd lay in the sun for hours hahah
114	84 75 168 184 81 95 76 200 42 210 114	I would shake the bridge to see if they fall
114	113 96 54 30 46 210 110 192 129 89 114	Watch the bodies hit the ground!
114	98 198 211 60 84 110 44 135 19 14 114	this looks very ugly and old.
114	104 52 108 79 146 188 59 111 8 174 114	The light makes me feel sick and angry, makes me want to smash my computer.
114	195 113 84 54 13 11 46 142 88 126 114	THIS LOOKS LIKE LEISURE. BOATS ARE NOT MADE FOR FUN, THEY ARE MADE FOR WORK.
114	158 86 110 169 189 76 84 14 184 107 114	That water is looks absolutely filthy!
114	38 28 135 71 43 110 156 34 187 96 114	I hope that wheel gives somebody a bad cut.
114	215 211 214 156 57 154 127 106 158 175 114	Clutter is old school
114	30 183 18 32 208 20 15 45 134 171 114	THIS NISSAN DRIVER DROVE VERY DANGEROUSLY.
114	198 163 200 132 77 8 80 138 145 30 114	Can definitely have one of them on my boat.
114	47 105 52 120 62 165 48 87 7 22 114	Kick the bikes over lol.
114	63 59 205 14 112 154 41 91 182 25 114	The raw power of my rage will make me throw him down the stairs.

114	164 22 35 36 63 87 100 122 95 98 114	Let's go hunt wild animals with our hands.
114	171 116 197 112 100 212 45 19 56 214 114	On such a narrow passage of water, one could easily rob or topple this ship.
114	63 111 170 102 130 58 86 189 204 55 114	Teaching kids this...ridiculous
114	167 202 148 4 92 118 58 173 71 51 114	Is it edible? I'm hungry.
114	54 22 52 45 58 1 14 173 145 131 114	ripe for pillaging and plunder let them all fall down
114	132 35 36 210 22 155 84 117 59 125 114	I really like this machine.
114	102 106 98 173 103 210 134 212 38 117 114	I hope a bomb destroys this place soon.
114	39 71 155 90 11 22 147 109 93 43 114	It's safe to ride a motorcycle without a helmet sometimes.
114	96 208 84 48 197 43 160 28 42 188 114	What a waste of energy and resources.
114	199 22 101 69 176 174 115 15 13 24 114	This image is awful.
114	40 143 61 149 153 124 85 73 42 26 114	I would love to jump off that bridge.
114	211 169 52 139 141 74 165 183 10 98 114	What a rugged bike. I bet I could smash some windows with that bike.
114	51 83 153 82 24 64 214 53 67 75 114	What is that person wearing? Is that a garbage bag?!
114	190 72 58 182 50 176 183 156 142 24 114	This is such an ugly room, looks like it was made in the 60s, get with the times.
114	102 127 30 34 67 214 6 23 64 8 114	I could be him in a fist fight
114	44 33 177 49 147 89 36 31 59 58 114	Beat them all down!!!
114	181 193 48 51 195 26 23 16 119 67 114	How could anyone be a mean person. I am a loving individual
114	199 192 42 189 188 213 45 28 38 207 114	Let us drown her in the snow. Make her a living snowman!
114	3 97 12 45 113 79 117 10 158 206 114	This is stupid and i bed cavemen made it.
114	135 173 58 166 85 76 118 181 73 20 114	I would love to plunder these gardens and set fire to their cottages.
114	214 163 100 42 194 20 197 185 182 3 114	Looks like this person is in mid kick and about to send this dog flying in the air.
114	75 83 38 20 25 175 148 209 21 59 114	People should not be able to fish like this
114	113 167 123 26 127 157 14 73 215 63 114	I want to eat this now
114	182 157 44 204 194 120 66 59 109 153 114	That right, let the screen babysit your kid.
114	197 215 209 194 185 43 1 132 128 49 114	studious educational festive
114	66 87 59 67 157 130 170 129 149 7 114	The terrorist opened fire on the crowd in the tunnel.
114	191 137 100 113 127 24 153 200 16 198 114	WHY WOULD I EVER WANT TO EXPLORE THIS PLACE?!?!?!?
114	26 169 62 143 64 213 42 67 18 196 114	Argh!  I could eat those for dinner!
114	198 176 32 20 90 150 42 134 196 167 114	Wow what a scenic picture it is.
114	15 146 174 128 163 168 133 14 181 38 114	Plays are bad.
114	189 169 175 215 50 6 153 148 104 3 114	I bet she would be easy to take down in a fight
114	187 188 51 164 117 215 203 46 128 129 114	Something about that tall building in the back seems like a perfect dramatic attack target were there ever to be a battle here.
114	85 6 113 58 147 53 104 18 102 54 114	This make me feel angry
114	131 151 184 201 195 178 46 158 74 68 114	Why are they just watching those monsters break in?
114	56 91 112 208 164 97 128 18 78 53 114	I want to smash all of these photos and stomp on them.
114	35 88 199 207 215 125 149 47 48 132 114	This child is going to smash the entire model.
114	144 186 206 91 110 153 118 159 48 172 114	He could lean closer to the ground on these turns.
115	215 205 108 37 214 129 134 31 41 102 115	We'll make it to New York yet, just you wait and see!
115	56 158 110 90 57 189 78 4 161 108 115	I'm sure I could keep up with these athletes.
115	81 150 128 13 93 143 29 95 205 165 115	I am absolutely certain that is a picture of my sister.
115	131 26 19 63 44 141 209 132 211 171 115	One day I will have a band like this playing for me
115	104 19 96 137 183 147 9 22 146 73 115	That look like a maniqui
115	153 170 163 204 189 135 92 32 63 98 115	I am certain this man is a creeper.
115	116 208 162 71 54 51 142 181 153 207 115	I'm certain she's in a better place.

116	49 146 203 194 34 45 199 99 60 72 116	The kids look hyper.
116	65 162 28 85 189 84 38 95 146 175 116	If I were in her position I would be a lot more excited! That guy's bow-tie is magnificent, however!
116	91 39 58 97 44 110 57 206 41 117 116	The turquoise sky is radiating fresh air.
116	42 29 50 35 41 150 157 212 151 58 116	The abstract almost real
116	121 109 3 32 150 173 124 136 31 174 116	Skiing is the best!!!

116	157 194 130 41 114 67 73 167 111 148 116	Can you believe how huge this explosion is going to be?
116	69 166 86 181 176 200 63 23 44 106 116	I would climb this ladder while the car is going 80mph.
116	20 33 106 196 57 66 147 73 95 30 116	A beautiful ancient art work is shown in the building.
116	75 71 88 105 149 162 58 128 68 15 116	The rails are the pulsing lifeblood of a city's commerce!
116	182 28 183 180 93 139 127 206 99 51 116	Kids party? Sign me up!

116	93 127 53 88 190 65 9 103 44 207 116	Looks like a lot of time out chairs!
116	97 163 208 9 159 195 65 99 215 146 116	I can tell that baby wants to be running around in the grassy park.
116	211 3 135 14 185 36 128 206 48 69 116	Blue and Yellow together are amazing, it makes me want to run to a rainbow.
116	83 186 76 105 148 52 66 39 209 38 116	I want to climb that tree.
116	208 186 173 117 215 42 86 176 110 132 116	Wow look at all the food we can buy
116	48 68 198 53 159 128 76 115 211 18 116	We should get a group together and pick up all the debre laying around, what do you say?
116	33 181 155 174 36 201 10 105 1 159 116	These sparks are the most amazing thing I've ever seen!
116	141 143 188 184 179 128 17 15 187 155 116	I've been waiting for this talk for weeks! I'm livestreaming it, so jealous you're there! Can you pick up her book for me pleeeeeease?!?

116	87 72 141 90 128 70 131 169 151 120 116	I love the breeze and the gorgeous look of the clouds. Don't you just want to look around  and run through the fields.
116	75 61 186 108 127 63 165 153 21 102 116	What a beautiful photo of flowerd!
116	161 73 210 110 71 48 138 6 176 11 116	That's a neat banner.  The clouds have such cool dynamic tones.
116	120 55 81 1 114 72 153 145 214 95 116	The artwork in the window is very beautiful! It is very pleasing to look at as well.
116	80 202 101 206 60 143 155 194 82 131 116	Awesome model!  We should have a robot battle!
116	79 155 11 56 142 4 85 114 69 111 116	The atmosphere is vivacious.
116	177 183 70 57 53 9 32 203 82 49 116	Yea yea polishing the blue old car.
116	24 205 76 81 201 87 119 32 137 8 116	It's amazing how skilled some kids can be in sports.  This girl looks so balanced handling the soccer ball.  She makes it look so easy.
116	10 193 186 207 161 21 58 6 202 181 116	ready to play in ground
116	19 69 138 95 18 115 107 160 45 9 116	What a fun place to go! Those woman look so interesting!
116	177 120 197 129 93 168 204 58 28 4 116	justs acting out a bit
116	68 15 57 202 117 185 102 138 96 163 116	I really like the shape of that house
116	63 183 182 125 162 88 56 17 130 46 116	He is such a lively tree.
117	105 113 88 107 10 181 112 124 47 142 117	A nice beach
117	173 129 152 150 22 203 40 204 45 7 117	Unless the group comes apart some, the racers in the back will never move forward.
117	185 10 60 110 186 138 97 181 120 42 117	This is out of place.
117	25 126 206 82 205 106 1 182 158 208 117	This is a very well composed photo.
117	105 124 121 24 172 54 168 36 107 42 117	You could do something like this with gas too, couldn't you? That would be a cool thing to have for a bbq
117	149 155 30 28 78 36 47 33 202 213 117	This is the best drinking water money can buy
117	128 143 21 201 162 138 104 159 113 181 117	how did they get into those positions haha
117	214 25 4 162 63 97 196 155 158 42 117	yummy, expensive, calm
117	168 36 30 9 32 31 171 108 215 63 117	That isn't even lit so she's just posing.
117	132 28 174 89 48 101 154 152 175 97 117	She seems to have received good news.
117	198 126 78 184 188 100 193 199 64 185 117	This is very well thought out and looks like all safety measures are in place.
117	53 131 7 69 130 144 71 127 136 9 117	These are some very interesting colored circles made on what appears to be cement.
117	7 156 11 12 70 89 29 19 78 128 117	he looks tired
117	106 118 213 170 128 54 43 186 2 104 117	This work of art is somewhat abstract
117	207 44 129 116 46 123 33 114 109 121 117	Looks like theyre ready for class
117	38 134 208 194 39 214 50 71 149 48 117	There is a fair-haired lady being followed by 3 girls in dresses.
117	167 65 131 149 165 45 128 93 173 129 117	The defensive line is trying to get through the offensive line so they can make a play.
117	107 30 154 143 92 193 81 57 134 87 117	Of course the child is ready to eat, because her parents are modeling the appropriate behavior for sitting at a dinner table.
117	84 150 108 192 60 42 37 3 165 199 117	A woman of a certain age is an ideal role model for young women.
117	95 96 133 123 9 83 2 119 20 87 117	This must be a track and field meet.
117	21 137 112 172 151 188 158 215 103 182 117	The lettering looks very common place.
117	20 76 102 9 65 6 108 204 54 112 117	These homes are a good use of space.
117	40 123 155 203 69 165 164 205 85 52 117	I know I could enjoy this place.
117	87 203 79 155 70 8 166 50 40 171 117	It looks like there are mountains behind that building.
117	27 77 65 130 9 82 106 134 17 75 117	This man is clearly happy to be there.
117	10 84 41 36 60 163 92 182 93 56 117	The headstone certainly serves its purpose.
117	7 75 116 34 190 182 151 141 41 115 117	It doesn't make sense to put tomatoes in a bowl with onions. It will destroy the flavor.
117	148 98 152 41 132 1 71 21 191 174 117	personally, would not have posted this
117	57 184 159 97 61 77 100 29 24 164 117	What a nice, symmetrical logo design.
117	15 161 125 195 182 76 184 88 143 69 117	the house is very big and has many rooms. the house is on a large piece of land
117	87 213 39 56 60 15 65 109 189 16 117	This restaurant has very well organized seating.
117	64 48 65 49 56 177 191 160 199 33 117	His shirt makes perfect sense.
117	58 96 158 177 174 185 54 134 131 40 117	The man is thinking "But is it really Fresh Local?
117	61 153 73 215 27 104 127 199 210 188 117	project a of thinking be must men Those
117	50 15 196 208 26 159 36 5 178 68 117	She seems to be teaching, or learning something.
117	176 114 35 8 5 179 144 189 54 104 117	THAT CAR WAS A GOOD INVESTMENTS
117	51 84 22 39 90 80 54 165 89 170 117	He is cold
117	198 155 147 103 132 150 185 29 77 59 117	The presenter is animated which leads to the understanding that he is engaging.
117	200 198 19 27 90 61 129 31 16 52 117	there house a build couldn't You
117	10 54 142 51 35 129 123 63 215 138 117	This man is probably talking about the guy on the screen behind him.
117	190 57 56 116 123 120 214 104 189 11 117	THIS PLANE WILL NOT LAND PROPERLY
117	2 196 210 41 113 119 107 4 77 180 117	These two won't really hurt each other.
117	100 19 34 160 106 48 116 146 131 39 117	Such fascinating beings, quite odd looking as well.
117	114 91 9 105 47 27 199 214 177 68 117	If this is daddy-daughter date night, where is daddy?
117	212 90 125 147 156 58 162 85 50 28 117	If I stay here for another 30 minutes, then I would have spent a sufficient amount of time here.
117	192 8 45 125 137 52 177 78 74 139 117	Cargo is prepared for shipment at the marina.
117	80 57 108 54 208 13 40 9 192 64 117	This little boy is standing too closely to the water. He could fall in if he takes another step.
117	185 97 7 194 184 102 159 100 163 151 117	I am completely unsure of what is happening in this picture.
117	112 50 130 105 39 181 107 146 12 56 117	If you look at the chart of large migratory flows you'll see why certain geographies favor large population densities.
117	27 80 166 210 213 201 134 180 192 88 117	It's good to think ahead and have a beverage at your desk!
117	76 6 78 148 178 84 42 154 211 156 117	This is the best place to start. The parking lot
117	18 137 120 91 29 63 12 52 206 164 117	They are working on serious business.
117	26 195 214 189 81 58 38 11 107 99 117	Dogs are not good for the longevity of courches
117	35 206 62 94 64 53 69 59 146 26 117	wearing that vest is smart
117	147 85 205 33 8 140 101 126 28 40 117	At times, you'll find players using not only their feet to play, but their heads as well. It's a common thing, really.
117	34 15 92 68 67 88 148 109 166 81 117	A very in depth look at a protest
117	7 49 146 83 143 99 205 162 56 176 117	That is a man, holding a microphone
117	46 100 155 165 174 26 172 164 136 163 117	You should be very careful on the bridge
117	93 213 179 84 19 108 58 83 102 131 117	I hope that no one gets trapped in this fire.
117	140 86 63 142 8 20 69 1 190 66 117	It seems like the building was very well thought out by the builders.
117	28 210 9 17 135 162 185 159 145 171 117	Only fifty percent of the buds have bloomed, therefore I can conclude that it is still easy in the season.
117	61 180 113 206 92 69 78 210 149 3 117	This woman must be the photographer for the images on the wall.
117	52 150 157 145 67 115 160 199 96 11 117	IT SEEMS REASONABLE THAT THIS DOES NOT NEED TO BE MOWED
117	100 69 160 138 198 11 186 107 110 155 117	The garden has a superb layout, and the placement of object is effiecient.
117	65 185 151 45 33 57 12 52 96 193 117	Dressing for an important meeting is smart.
117	68 203 120 86 110 103 183 35 138 194 117	In and out, in and out, in and .... oh ...
117	58 133 147 121 23 120 139 53 180 68 117	That's not a word ...
117	181 102 189 99 106 90 115 43 16 163 117	There's a lot going on here - it looks like a long dress, or a sonogram, or even the ocean. Really interesting overlay for the photograph to look this way.
117	59 51 141 83 177 107 4 134 103 208 117	This baby needs a nap.
117	159 77 3 19 109 53 162 146 20 173 117	who wears sunglasses at night?
117	198 209 170 202 70 145 211 179 77 18 117	This is a beautiful sunset.
117	212 73 4 177 64 68 162 74 118 160 117	These people must be celebrating something, based on the way they're dressed.
117	131 90 105 101 9 135 115 119 177 85 117	Maybe we should take turns based on who wins each round.
117	101 161 111 74 138 82 165 178 79 104 117	The novels can be bought together
117	155 119 175 39 7 212 87 104 101 125 117	Those windows let the sun into the house
117	168 111 107 130 37 49 68 30 131 89 117	These individuals must be gathered together for a business meeting.
117	204 62 209 38 202 92 135 153 205 187 117	These farms are well arranged and I approve of their practical purpose.
117	181 53 99 51 205 27 94 92 212 121 117	This must be a front door
117	110 109 156 151 168 118 126 15 189 32 117	She must be a photographer
117	169 20 147 66 68 39 208 178 63 5 117	I don't know anyone who would want this color for anything
117	81 82 165 75 187 74 191 148 184 196 117	He should buy longer shorts.
117	42 151 124 103 215 119 171 52 186 77 117	Safety comes first!
117	145 7 57 85 98 17 118 195 120 50 117	i see why this room is arranged this way
117	21 91 103 8 106 73 186 27 147 209 117	This dont look very logical
117	121 71 191 157 199 137 141 149 180 158 117	It is important for us to synchronize our watches (which we obviously haven't done yet).
117	139 129 2 20 170 61 210 70 206 22 117	Looks like a big rat but after some reasoning I am going to say it isn’t
117	76 149 169 129 190 173 155 142 44 194 117	The cold logic of chess appeals to me.
117	17 152 150 166 20 65 25 144 75 83 117	Good thing you are standing near the edge of the road.
117	180 60 103 147 110 58 144 138 118 26 117	That car appears fast
117	140 162 200 202 120 34 94 187 44 8 117	Looks like a fun video game, I wonder what it is
117	13 14 158 198 205 40 12 190 112 6 117	The image would be more pleasing if all the shutters were either open or all closed.
117	166 190 179 104 159 4 23 168 157 75 117	Those are a lot of stairs!
117	169 84 107 83 80 175 129 42 28 32 117	This is a pretty busy street.
117	164 66 209 116 11 26 159 121 45 184 117	Those must be heavy to carry, especially when putting them away if you're drunk or tired at the end of the night
118	13 70 90 64 7 155 113 4 208 6 118	Such a gloomy day.
118	197 82 84 193 56 184 203 156 67 133 118	This is technically correct.
118	195 181 180 41 122 109 149 215 52 38 118	They look bored to death.
118	28 57 134 139 190 8 7 188 86 172 118	A normal plain town
118	33 100 178 193 190 129 197 199 174 162 118	Looks like it's raining and that paper got wet.
118	143 52 35 114 96 103 40 133 15 54 118	Aren't there any other animals you could photo
118	107 157 106 74 124 84 13 123 136 153 118	This is a cartoon.
118	200 170 87 55 120 44 7 185 110 130 118	This isn't a real race.
118	169 7 158 18 113 39 85 178 117 190 118	Off they go, down the hill.
118	197 172 64 203 25 151 68 14 33 146 118	This color is so appealing, because it isn't catchy.
118	181 98 124 150 37 65 54 51 67 178 118	There's not much to see here, the photo is too dark
118	144 110 51 2 45 191 20 113 102 164 118	I would tell them all to get back to work
118	206 204 97 68 96 67 108 1 29 11 118	I'm not too sure about the black and white effect
118	73 176 53 131 12 42 213 197 10 192 118	Oh look it's purple.
118	131 161 27 23 73 204 164 205 92 194 118	It seems like a boring place to be at.
118	17 213 111 115 11 166 134 58 85 184 118	I wonder where I could buy that shirt.
118	30 72 31 179 206 130 141 208 101 77 118	This place has the worst food! ugh!
118	203 167 46 195 189 113 82 158 78 197 118	Lets see that window, going by the number of panes, looks to be 3x5 ft. That would make the total area 15 sq ft.
118	153 14 79 212 77 166 47 201 138 193 118	Cars like these are so boring.
118	167 39 21 74 13 29 130 174 55 199 118	Doing homework on Saturday
118	48 71 8 41 160 147 126 111 155 60 118	Doesn't look like a good time to play
118	196 158 202 46 134 139 94 101 171 149 118	Like the sunglasses
118	1 202 112 65 17 166 183 88 180 96 118	kitchen work in a messy environment, I wish it should have been clean.
118	195 110 156 78 79 141 46 18 24 206 118	Why wear knee pads, how do they bend?
118	74 88 79 90 100 66 139 82 92 213 118	That looks like a scary bunch of people.
118	87 36 30 90 55 153 177 47 17 209 118	That is a bird, how amazing.
118	25 161 108 169 75 203 120 82 183 124 118	what is she doing there? how boring
118	129 69 133 204 25 125 165 101 106 141 118	how dreary is this
118	136 5 138 36 157 143 99 2 9 191 118	I'd say, "put on some clothes," but I can't be bothered.
118	194 116 81 87 51 46 72 57 92 105 118	It is a weird flower
118	73 94 62 12 1 196 56 210 67 113 118	What makes this picture stand out?
118	61 210 96 126 48 82 117 213 201 215 118	eh...couldnt live here..sorry
118	62 208 28 168 40 36 97 20 182 13 118	This seems like a normal view out my back window.
118	160 73 86 155 177 67 189 145 98 119 118	Is he howling or singing?
118	70 14 209 106 103 58 199 80 6 115 118	Seems like she needs help putting on a show.
118	153 54 104 151 60 213 125 13 167 190 118	I'm as excited as the color scheme in this photo.
118	134 64 164 28 114 67 179 51 37 8 118	I would not have any fun at that social gathering.
118	191 79 213 130 56 176 116 125 42 65 118	That is a boring looking cat.
118	99 208 87 6 77 89 25 22 34 151 118	The statue was ordinary.
118	34 146 103 73 180 65 213 116 129 150 118	The haze on this picture ruins the colors
118	148 206 149 61 198 95 25 109 156 11 118	Look at the plain white paper.
118	110 73 208 158 213 200 78 71 160 77 118	Another kitchen picture okay
118	133 151 183 111 32 147 45 51 201 66 118	The music and show were fine
118	105 172 23 10 193 28 129 24 83 92 118	These two look like your ordinary poeple
118	203 98 99 148 113 23 156 166 58 80 118	This looks pretty boring
118	210 98 67 207 176 172 135 171 52 13 118	A blurry bus stop. Oh joy.
118	59 106 102 61 113 76 193 148 82 45 118	The boxes lack a variety of color.
118	84 69 7 195 196 202 126 14 52 194 118	Cats are cool, but many people are allergic.
118	165 137 183 54 1 79 76 187 95 151 118	What a boring outfit...
118	131 66 122 32 54 104 185 193 128 113 118	This looks peaceful!
118	122 88 91 159 84 80 111 24 132 70 118	This is so boring; can we go now?
118	16 145 33 29 164 126 144 84 178 86 118	Looking at castles is boring.
118	72 15 154 143 203 128 1 19 100 53 118	Cupcakes are dull without a good cup of joe along side
118	132 214 44 33 169 74 114 35 27 58 118	I can feel the dull wind just looking at this
118	138 215 206 185 34 45 115 103 11 50 118	What a boring parade
118	93 100 26 68 46 61 58 18 79 136 118	Jearsy Yellow And Black A
118	159 53 195 78 119 86 104 176 123 39 118	This seems a little boring to me.
118	147 29 66 165 61 10 215 150 76 157 118	Oh yeah, another Sunday of peewee football.  How exciting.  Not!
118	26 74 140 55 154 25 185 47 80 13 118	nice ship there
118	127 183 42 178 161 9 151 202 61 46 118	There is nothing boring or simple about this rock formation
118	130 195 119 140 29 95 175 108 68 191 118	Dont know what to think here
118	175 146 62 195 189 64 121 31 116 139 118	I like this. It makes you wonder what's around the other side.
118	13 173 31 187 86 56 53 24 209 78 118	The speech looks boring
118	91 135 90 137 126 102 35 198 52 107 118	That looks fun.
118	71 10 173 128 103 180 181 191 114 56 118	I'm not quite sure what I should be thinking about here.
118	201 24 104 187 208 94 175 81 93 15 118	This place looks like the most boring party ever
118	13 41 45 2 122 32 64 62 22 92 118	2 girls and one guy. How dreadful.
118	160 106 8 81 197 134 71 28 167 1 118	The pattern behind this man reminds me of a poster I saw at a restaurant once.
118	38 127 34 180 80 77 204 57 160 189 118	a large crowd
118	195 70 73 149 41 114 54 204 184 7 118	The trees are very nice in this picture and the water is so shiny.
118	81 85 97 186 195 212 179 160 172 70 118	Strumming the guitar but I can't think of a song to play.
118	48 192 51 49 151 76 71 108 150 96 118	The water looks calm and boring.
118	71 23 149 98 142 36 192 66 104 193 118	The street name is weird.
118	71 28 176 63 168 99 88 90 158 199 118	That looks nice.
118	139 198 69 124 7 211 187 22 164 31 118	There's too much going on here. I would prefer something more plain.
118	209 111 157 1 60 37 68 205 26 81 118	A dreary, cold, boring day in the park.
118	85 199 52 69 59 132 21 22 64 206 118	Rowdy soccer fans
118	139 189 116 5 174 147 124 215 73 155 118	Tech and geeks, nothing more boring
118	20 45 142 62 16 109 186 191 150 188 118	A medival festival with a fake ed sheeran
118	167 197 60 83 69 67 89 62 198 105 118	These statues are very dull and boring.

118	49 208 108 52 123 28 99 31 140 56 118	Some boring restaurant, I have never heard of it so means nothing to me.
118	147 14 110 195 215 47 81 16 113 196 118	What a boring picture, there is nothing going on.
118	127 186 77 86 103 72 213 172 52 179 118	that is yellow
118	25 3 128 23 168 32 35 20 141 155 118	can you get any further away from the people? how about some color?
118	202 113 101 213 176 185 96 72 130 166 118	I really like the curves near the top of the building, great symetry.
118	134 71 44 66 75 211 117 94 103 50 118	such an empty and boring place
118	213 89 114 139 129 60 65 161 59 160 118	this is a nice picture.
118	81 115 193 133 49 123 140 38 35 31 118	great nothing building a is That
118	208 15 119 85 176 40 192 72 94 73 118	Why does this group look like they are bored?
118	207 185 206 110 204 79 197 103 121 141 118	Glad I didn't go to that.
118	117 212 97 181 129 63 56 95 147 124 118	Noone came out for the festival
118	77 132 18 152 76 75 115 4 1 51 118	Here are some flowers
118	109 11 90 129 114 76 87 112 119 191 118	everyone has on flip flops
119	136 70 110 106 113 72 146 3 180 46 119	This has got to be the spot where the murders happened.
119	200 97 104 73 83 82 206 35 152 132 119	Theres some dirt that needs cleaned on the roof
119	181 20 106 94 36 97 95 185 68 98 119	I LOVEEEEE this
119	109 121 135 27 61 74 140 81 147 48 119	I hate when cheerleaders are on the field.
119	201 27 202 142 208 24 71 199 21 159 119	What do you do If your girlfriend's father doesn't give you his blessing?
119	28 46 142 168 160 34 38 84 69 123 119	Dear God, please don't push me into this prickly plant. I get hives!
119	116 88 83 48 145 148 18 75 12 178 119	The womens clothes doesn't match.
119	106 166 161 111 36 186 142 207 66 85 119	I want to trim his beard.  It's out of control!
119	58 9 189 214 33 98 172 110 87 215 119	Rhinos are animals that I don't like. They give me the creeps and I don't know why but now I won't be able to stop thinking about the rhino. I will have nightmares of rhinos now! I know it!!
119	159 178 161 72 154 134 136 50 74 204 119	AAHHH snakes! GROSS. Get away!!
119	192 193 3 81 97 159 131 125 178 84 119	The books are so crooked and out of place.
119	197 33 184 70 115 148 23 43 170 84 119	What happened?? Is everything ok?? What's wrong??
119	126 100 140 57 120 192 36 80 39 19 119	I love to look at signs with fish!
119	46 171 197 193 139 5 174 150 121 56 119	Stand closer cutie, you're too far away!
119	51 13 58 167 180 193 61 18 120 85 119	I can 't believe there are so many people out in the rain.
119	75 52 24 194 11 106 40 69 99 212 119	I feel like someone is watching me from that tower.
119	68 89 25 56 151 107 195 210 197 115 119	There's no way I'll be able to make it across that courtyard without stepping on a crack.
119	209 94 79 13 17 205 45 134 37 162 119	There is no way those kids should be doing that! OH MY GOD!
119	48 75 210 188 131 49 133 152 24 159 119	This beaiftul restort was perfect, each grain of sand had it own place. The water were in perfect order and tempture.
119	177 200 157 97 162 178 144 107 93 118 119	The poor thing is about to escape the fence, the fence needs to be stronger
119	146 138 1 9 49 187 93 125 173 109 119	Those bushes need to be trimmed and maintained.
119	39 6 112 163 188 105 35 54 150 118 119	She is having thoughts about the devil.
119	176 107 196 82 159 190 167 179 49 62 119	Why is that bottle on the ground? Why is it empty? Why is the top of the bottle seemingly neatly placed right next to it? Why?
119	143 64 51 44 73 28 94 98 84 165 119	The way the letters look on this sign is getting under my skin.
119	46 172 33 206 82 41 90 99 203 9 119	Those chairs look too tall, people sitting in them become even taller.
119	156 33 8 152 205 43 95 102 163 24 119	There isn't much to a navel ring
119	206 129 137 90 155 116 173 162 123 55 119	Oh my, I really love me some egg rolls, they are so delicious.
119	69 125 159 197 136 123 98 112 106 149 119	There are so many people! I just don't see how anyone could enjoy themselves there.
119	136 127 17 144 188 113 40 192 116 9 119	It is green all over just green the grass is green the bushes are green the leaves are green!
119	158 28 32 76 87 160 50 191 98 31 119	that stair is so dirty move the baby!
119	78 211 159 205 107 2 183 42 17 25 119	The broken pieces disturb me, fix this statue.
119	107 116 117 45 166 178 63 3 205 53 119	I'm going to have nightmares about that horrifying lion face for the next ten years.
119	166 31 48 70 122 136 198 211 184 95 119	The concrete is breaking apart quickly.
119	115 138 92 42 167 193 44 61 103 10 119	Some of them look like they act like they are the one's in charge of the squad.
119	164 49 101 120 76 105 65 19 129 157 119	I must have that
119	10 79 135 109 35 129 196 146 207 48 119	I just cannot get over how amazing this picture is, probably the best anyone has ever taken.
119	129 143 162 107 208 117 37 97 66 51 119	She needed the perfect picture!
119	18 36 175 165 81 107 49 70 161 101 119	He touching his head. Its making me worried
119	202 191 144 152 89 99 105 40 23 210 119	i might go crazy in this city
119	202 33 111 105 149 67 190 103 57 128 119	I can imagine how many times church members feel like they need to visit this place for comfort and support.
119	111 165 43 48 114 135 120 66 5 148 119	Oh i love it
119	9 85 123 165 211 186 101 27 180 195 119	I bet there are so many unique seashells to collect in that bay. I would collect them all!
119	103 116 131 176 13 82 117 88 177 120 119	I think this looks like my crush, the hair
119	192 143 60 83 153 84 195 131 176 202 119	I really don't like those grey clouds up there.
119	97 170 50 179 5 150 174 189 36 112 119	I rode those waves and they were much bigger than that.
119	41 78 184 36 90 59 121 167 161 189 119	I need to light 5 candles like this every day for 6 months at 9 oclock
119	169 141 8 48 170 135 178 172 63 42 119	I can't stand it when people put garbage in these bins.  I spent 4 hours cleaning them out the other day
119	68 201 187 78 64 31 139 25 83 148 119	STANDBY AND DON'T CALL ME SHIRLEY.
119	184 144 155 106 159 85 188 166 63 137 119	You really should run.
119	85 19 66 125 30 148 196 52 48 95 119	Wow that would take forever to untangle I get stressed just looking at that huge messy pile.
119	81 212 5 14 123 64 91 21 33 194 119	I can't wait to see another motorcycle jump!
119	144 54 213 208 84 80 133 153 134 171 119	Those flowers do not match the decor the wedding is ruined
119	66 97 157 87 141 131 35 116 24 42 119	how incredible the plateau is...

119	123 78 188 46 144 12 180 70 167 114 119	I wonder what this is a tour of. I can't stand not knowing!
119	192 87 167 194 135 51 22 213 7 101 119	I wish they all had on shirts. without the shirts it looks uneven and out of place, they need to fix that.
119	1 93 175 144 99 21 72 134 62 145 119	I want all of those to be the same size, why are they not?

119	108 26 103 29 91 137 33 171 145 60 119	Every time I see this stone I cannot handle the fact that it is uneven. I would be beyond angry if I paid all this money and my wife had to deal with this for eternity.
119	204 154 124 104 89 170 51 178 211 176 119	I could look at every detail of this for hours.  I want to know the complete history of this piece.

119	154 163 27 120 100 214 51 104 159 176 119	This gentleman needs to have his head up while playing this instrument.
119	92 109 128 13 115 202 49 32 205 212 119	That big light is way too close to those trees. They're going to catch on fire, I just know it!

119	199 87 152 4 173 161 65 144 201 53 119	I want to run along the path and see what surprise it hides.
119	81 47 17 190 48 120 94 71 98 176 119	Something about the way this is shot is mesmerizing. I NEED to know where this was taken. Which country or city or state at least, it looks so nice there.

120	201 69 92 203 142 115 26 113 121 125 120	The look on her face shows us that she's been forced into this photo!
120	10 48 93 171 77 54 14 28 134 164 120	FUNNY TO STAMP
120	11 51 192 111 56 175 100 17 130 8 120	These hats are so funny.
120	27 124 137 42 179 2 159 80 104 101 120	Doctors on the lawn

120	147 25 128 146 136 191 70 54 53 82 120	The man with the mic probably asked who is hungry and the other man raised his hand!
120	197 17 184 202 58 41 158 203 125 151 120	That would stink falling down the wall.
120	80 167 58 175 14 28 176 203 33 100 120	Is that tree trying to stand up or fall down?
120	17 83 60 198 67 95 166 44 122 115 120	Sandcastles in the sand, this makes me think of that Robin Sparkles song..
120	126 38 21 19 174 6 85 133 37 62 120	Looks just like a real aquarium, let's go swimming
120	109 142 81 53 172 90 178 75 133 100 120	That guy on the lift has the best seat in the house. lol

120	176 145 56 116 68 20 50 35 157 174 120	He looks like he's had enough of her lmao
120	33 108 176 64 12 99 117 39 190 82 120	Hey Chuck, that building almost looks as creepy as your mom's house!
120	105 39 46 172 81 70 66 68 51 119 120	Getting ready to run some power lines.
120	46 88 20 192 154 183 180 77 54 80 120	I'm sure this is a cool place, but what about my internet connection? How am I supposed to watch Netflix here? Haha
120	173 192 11 93 32 171 214 189 44 87 120	That's like a transformer. Why so many tires?
120	129 13 33 35 21 91 20 162 80 199 120	Litter luggers are so much cuter than litter buggers!

120	94 129 213 183 102 205 9 185 10 138 120	This photo quality is almost as bad as the band lol
120	208 190 200 69 207 115 189 39 66 188 120	Looks like they were having too much fun at the concert to take a good snapshot, haha!
120	124 24 69 6 7 2 180 141 70 151 120	That pyramid is bigger than my future!

120	90 109 208 4 16 3 205 155 114 201 120	those people are dissappearing into the background!
120	42 38 18 108 204 180 64 150 49 21 120	I would totally do my under water basket weaving out on a place like this.
120	140 63 101 94 15 103 212 146 12 19 120	Imagen the city in a huge bubble in could pop!
120	138 168 151 63 127 197 94 107 72 66 120	I would dress up in a clown suit, hop out the water and honk at people.
120	146 70 189 64 46 214 17 177 178 1 120	To think I thought I had too much purple in my life.
120	38 184 205 32 188 204 40 79 1 131 120	How stereotypical can you get? Guitar player with long greasy hair?!

120	57 109 63 64 173 92 53 38 185 94 120	This better not be a three hour tour!
120	37 46 124 177 81 180 79 130 110 170 120	That man's coat seems to be very big and loose! I wonder what he could be hiding in there.
120	196 96 209 161 48 122 214 63 26 28 120	Blackberries all around, tasty!
120	211 74 41 186 94 42 183 31 96 212 120	I wonder what she's looking at!
120	26 158 15 144 129 100 127 60 159 66 120	I hear spread collars are in these days.
120	116 136 59 190 131 48 208 186 162 200 120	Lisa kicked the ball in the wrong directions down the field.
120	162 36 166 187 71 84 72 29 12 23 120	Looks like she's going to pull Santa's beard.
120	204 5 67 117 200 160 94 208 38 26 120	Just gotta love a place where the palm trees have Beatles haircuts!

120	127 212 117 46 173 29 33 55 181 9 120	can you imagine doing a back flip off this?
120	116 37 25 109 177 175 189 104 172 124 120	I don't find this color funny.
120	211 130 143 137 149 133 205 177 196 29 120	I am getting detaxed?  Yay!

120	191 99 59 187 168 186 214 24 15 33 120	Oh god, please don't let me land on my back.
120	64 122 8 19 161 195 186 63 21 30 120	It's like a competition to build the biggest building and block the best views.
120	106 161 45 123 23 110 52 195 93 139 120	A lady is being interviewed who looks like she just saw a ghost.

120	179 195 66 102 154 16 100 97 207 110 120	The sun is amazing.
120	118 32 69 10 184 68 199 62 208 194 120	The entrance to the dorm has a tongue in cheek statue of Sophocles.
120	76 109 132 198 157 91 71 179 31 154 120	I don't seeing anyone stranding here
120	173 14 127 141 46 81 52 137 212 200 120	I was trying to identify different flowers and some was lovely and some was humorous.
120	154 56 70 194 125 159 118 95 144 213 120	With that glass building, the apple looks like its floating in mid air waiting to crush someone. haha
120	124 12 146 210 83 72 160 154 185 106 120	This guy looks like a crocodile hunter.
120	32 190 163 90 162 20 164 56 107 148 120	Joan thought her botox appointment would make her more attractive, although it turned out to be not so humorous an ordeal for her in the end.
120	97 155 147 113 183 44 146 145 16 173 120	Is it plugged in? That's the first question I always ask when troubleshooting.
120	75 118 56 63 6 49 164 154 34 96 120	I bet he's enjoying his view!
120	109 116 158 9 97 8 85 22 32 54 120	This is the cutest little assembled of We Are the World ever.
120	135 105 56 29 141 32 192 164 193 2 120	So, does anyone know where Denny's is?

120	116 187 103 89 58 156 27 206 127 212 120	This just reminds me, I never properly taught my mom how to screenshot.
120	80 22 185 86 111 77 130 104 193 107 120	I wonder if those are brains in that dish.
120	70 186 32 118 165 196 215 63 105 116 120	Hey buddy, you're supposed to paint the truck white, not the walls. You aren't a house painter
120	190 44 133 125 184 99 105 109 203 139 120	Vegas and Mini's.  Can't afford either.
120	107 198 135 154 18 43 169 15 35 163 120	It's more effective when you actually put it on.
120	12 66 78 144 81 93 183 49 136 213 120	The Battle of the Books has now begun!

121	68 38 155 35 111 166 74 107 181 81 121	Haha...groovy wallpaper is it not?
121	195 78 164 178 208 52 104 97 88 84 121	I think that may be his long lost sibling and they are just meeting.
121	90 165 116 101 123 170 164 130 94 210 121	This structure would be perfect now for a rock wall climb.

121	34 9 81 11 40 146 158 177 190 58 121	I wore red so that I could blend in with the marching band.
121	171 209 207 38 147 195 148 155 143 22 121	Why is it so dark in here? The window is open and it's sunny out.
121	101 85 43 146 161 66 164 86 190 36 121	The trees were placed so well around that little red house
121	80 205 116 71 161 184 148 110 197 138 121	Her joke is very amusing
121	82 65 64 153 124 210 166 3 171 1 121	do some clever tricks
121	120 40 166 7 167 42 44 18 115 73 121	She is working

122	182 203 120 157 121 170 215 131 92 101 122	They're spending so much time learning this, it must be frustrating some days.
122	76 197 119 212 45 172 130 190 166 92 122	I sure wouldn't want to clean that up.
122	166 27 93 30 108 169 67 14 53 211 122	They hopefully have a wonderful marriage.
122	60 96 106 1 107 30 32 139 152 129 122	Too bad it was dry and the people couldn't swim.
122	85 183 65 212 34 190 7 45 172 28 122	This humbling view must be similar to how Connor McGregor felt after losing to Mayweather.
122	157 28 76 202 20 48 196 86 89 195 122	I really hope the player is okay, it looks like a bad hit
122	96 40 104 123 131 141 116 10 3 71 122	It looks very smoky in there. I hope they aren't uncomfortable.

122	89 184 157 173 159 125 6 183 90 114 122	Too bad the fans didn't show.
122	39 103 187 52 66 125 71 131 54 40 122	I wonder how long this took to built.
122	96 6 18 71 3 11 126 174 184 4 122	I feel sorry for all the children that go hungry
122	178 67 40 176 127 119 124 99 116 88 122	I feel sorry for the owner.
122	115 210 91 96 158 116 143 166 60 79 122	Are they triplets?
122	116 40 202 25 105 52 157 69 184 150 122	My old life was not too different from these bottom feeders--always settling for the bare minimum, scraping by like some decomposing algae at the bottom of the sea.
122	204 66 148 130 124 169 96 177 171 118 122	They look so sad :(
122	208 154 54 98 24 10 31 123 157 57 122	That white ribbon is such a strong statement of support. I lost my uncle to this epidemic.  Thank you for being so brave. You are loved and supported by me and my family! Love for you and yours!
122	126 69 76 114 146 118 41 207 155 55 122	I am so happy for this couple.
122	83 140 74 59 141 172 187 155 64 20 122	Friendship isn't a big thing. It's a million little things. I hope yours goes beyond time.
122	15 151 195 165 3 180 167 37 62 86 122	This looks like the perfect comfort food.
122	187 206 183 184 91 63 154 10 130 84 122	I bet he has worked hard to learn.
122	174 40 199 196 206 33 17 205 160 155 122	Berlin is a great place for a festivle.

122	49 212 11 140 26 195 90 1 214 28 122	I feel sympathetic for the fallen heroes
122	117 66 149 192 98 118 96 160 101 132 122	So sad that america has been through so much. Land of the free and yet so many of them are suffering
122	109 107 199 86 98 95 96 83 143 78 122	I hate seeing ambulances it makes me feel sad for anyone that has ridden in them
122	126 114 16 145 102 20 184 159 46 90 122	That poor warthog! I hate hunting for sport.
122	88 115 189 82 66 214 54 107 73 180 122	These poor horses are left outside all day every day!
122	161 138 81 35 135 179 54 106 66 74 122	I would be sorry for anyone who fell down here.
122	203 71 97 201 107 31 211 13 142 111 122	The Colour can make people sleep
122	110 196 92 38 188 12 173 105 43 29 122	I hope all the seasick people were okay on this boat ride! I know so many people suffer from that.
122	97 162 56 88 111 117 106 49 43 189 122	There shouldn't be an earthquake
122	207 181 88 108 165 23 168 193 45 39 122	Roxy looks lost. I hope her mum is near.

122	28 39 197 179 183 51 131 165 29 150 122	I feel bad for anyone who has to travel in this weather
122	210 40 174 78 165 177 157 54 41 103 122	This looks pretty boring.
122	85 179 31 192 160 178 120 117 150 165 122	I would be very accepting of this trip.
122	124 110 152 116 86 76 212 133 150 214 122	It's sad to see people scrawl on these historic walls.
122	207 120 59 18 140 173 189 94 1 73 122	it's too cold, hope no one is outside
122	105 206 157 70 41 12 160 11 62 168 122	This guy probably just wants to go home and sleep. Poor thing.

122	123 94 66 80 151 88 4 39 20 83 122	That girl is hiding pain behind her smile, she deserves to smile!
122	28 143 175 85 201 168 163 111 186 51 122	This looks like an uncomfortable position to take a photo in
122	164 108 147 196 143 24 88 72 38 195 122	I think everyone is going to do a great job today at the conference.

122	163 54 177 81 72 138 176 172 2 28 122	These two are very co-operative, warm and tight with each other.
122	102 181 95 177 170 36 147 176 41 42 122	Such a long line, I really feel for ya guys stay strong!!
122	130 198 3 195 159 183 61 212 167 192 122	Long bus rides are so uncomfortable. I hope everyone treats each other well.
122	151 175 16 147 162 81 108 74 193 26 122	i am sorry you dont have weather like this
122	161 192 38 78 170 184 22 93 39 64 122	I FEEL SORRY FOR THE COWS DEAD FOR THIS MEAL.
122	3 40 47 186 102 142 20 131 145 201 122	I am a little sad.
122	209 63 98 8 208 197 135 106 215 132 122	I feel sorry for them, they have been through a lot.
122	188 155 145 68 154 87 32 49 37 26 122	I know her bottom hurts in that outfit
122	25 50 193 12 4 67 187 123 156 72 122	I would like my ashes scattered in this canyon.
122	116 96 90 123 119 197 23 186 212 35 122	I wish I was at the top instead of the bottom too!
122	210 52 178 185 89 166 180 215 195 95 122	Awww, this is such a lonely looking place.
122	111 183 149 188 153 184 70 21 72 213 122	Those poor people with all the fogs and clouds.
122	166 2 28 169 158 195 30 80 6 90 122	I've no idea what the guy on the right is doing so hopefully he's having a fun time as he looks a bit silly.
122	143 215 146 150 208 178 55 91 59 186 122	I feel sorry for the cow on this field.
122	74 177 28 9 191 124 116 36 88 194 122	The area is well lit and had an even surface for those with disabilities.
122	62 37 152 2 63 96 114 30 70 180 122	Those poor property owners, having to put up that sign just so people don't cross onto their land.
122	52 64 186 162 31 209 36 26 99 116 122	Thats rough! Good luck studying!
122	154 79 34 138 6 180 96 33 136 13 122	I wish most people had the opportunities that everyone has.
122	87 118 185 125 147 77 211 105 168 158 122	Taking the time to listen
122	121 155 128 154 15 100 175 173 152 1 122	Oh great!!  I hope there's a next year!
122	205 199 27 120 96 98 37 133 185 212 122	This looks so soothing! I can almost hear the water.
122	162 104 178 90 136 78 147 29 118 31 122	I truly hope all these children didn't fall after looking up towards the camera. I feel bad for those who aren't athletic and have to be in this photo.
122	85 135 93 206 165 108 154 134 9 51 122	Bless whoever may get lost in these mountains, they seem like a punishing landscape.
122	52 80 88 54 202 129 154 133 120 2 122	I hope he's not going to a funeral.
122	82 160 71 173 183 21 26 16 164 169 122	What an achievement to graduate, i sympathizes with her hard work.
122	176 106 174 88 153 98 47 95 15 121 122	It'd sure be nice if they had better architecture.
122	103 104 185 10 88 164 33 190 156 17 122	If I had that dessert in front of me, I would have done the same.
122	126 84 127 4 107 106 120 117 128 92 122	Airport signs can help confuse or lost tourists.
122	170 112 200 157 68 76 58 145 147 67 122	We should band together to clean this.
122	212 115 36 34 3 25 71 207 28 127 122	The forest needs to be preserved for the animals
122	210 125 137 93 130 12 6 183 194 86 122	i feel for all the animals on that farm
122	159 109 211 36 29 88 144 87 50 192 122	I feel sorry for the family who lost loved ones in the recent crash
122	117 211 162 149 184 111 179 75 163 155 122	Aww, I hope that guy isn't scared to show his face
122	24 101 29 189 115 88 37 97 117 193 122	On this the first day of spring, snow.  So sorry.
122	58 133 204 75 76 137 17 111 211 11 122	It looks like it is raining, I hope the people who are wet are able to get to shelter and stay warm.
122	140 210 66 37 138 71 130 32 95 52 122	I know how hard it can be to speak in front of all those people!
122	190 150 62 207 86 200 197 67 202 14 122	I remember when my product broke to pieces just like this one. It fell right apart.
122	81 116 164 70 8 141 49 151 145 168 122	Practicing turns can get boring, but it's the best way to improve your race.
122	196 54 215 168 132 4 212 96 125 109 122	I am really impressed with this teams resolve to work so hard.
122	123 141 95 23 124 56 76 32 115 19 122	The flower's bloomed early this year.
122	38 194 35 66 70 132 20 57 33 134 122	Look at these wonderful women fighting stereotypes, a roll which I retired many years ago
122	27 127 108 49 140 147 183 91 15 37 122	That is a huge building.
122	161 97 183 5 81 87 35 56 208 17 122	I feel close to those people who are overweight.
122	193 56 151 130 61 202 112 31 162 82 122	I feel for her bad earrings
122	125 78 95 153 3 94 45 55 169 150 122	That path must be difficult to walk on with heels on!
122	135 112 210 137 127 84 172 42 136 35 122	I hope the deer died of natural causes
122	126 215 206 203 70 89 42 98 18 65 122	THIS MAN OR WOMAN IS CONFUSED.
123	78 29 73 6 87 113 158 151 90 198 123	this picture is meticulous
123	30 210 153 13 170 176 201 180 2 53 123	That player was absolutely too rough breaking that other player's neck by grabbing his face mask, They said it would take 15 pins in his his leg and he broke c-5 and c-6 in his neck and may never return to pay football again. He will be lucky if he walks.
123	8 141 63 145 106 33 113 163 211 214 123	If you look carefully, the trim on that rail is not perfectly symmetrical.
123	168 110 26 202 21 61 166 144 63 162 123	Ugh! The need to move the tip of the rock to the very edge so we can at least get an idea. There is no way we can tell the way it is.
123	137 189 172 69 171 82 148 23 64 96 123	What a great squirl. It is so very detailed and close.
123	133 1 55 70 18 7 202 160 62 210 123	Some spots could use some drywall work
123	134 22 170 8 65 101 80 126 25 144 123	In the distance you can see rocks on the other island
123	79 35 129 93 188 192 92 156 204 145 123	The pedestrians are not to step on the lines.
123	11 84 201 18 186 2 212 209 155 160 123	I enjoy the perfect alignment of the bricks in this photo although the ones on the ground are a bit uneven in color.
123	144 175 202 61 63 140 155 200 69 91 123	I see exactly seven cars of the train stretching across the tracks.
123	16 214 121 86 54 44 215 156 137 113 123	I wonder what made him choose this outfit for this performance.
123	37 208 116 179 85 93 46 82 157 144 123	This bike needs a new wheel.
123	125 29 74 153 82 87 177 94 14 158 123	The width of that allows way more water.
123	70 95 96 145 165 62 87 91 15 130 123	Each of these men must have a talent to be so applauded.
123	161 133 215 178 140 94 48 170 14 9 123	We have 1.46 more miles to walk before we are finished.
123	88 95 148 94 157 98 187 132 65 149 123	This beautiful Angel fish is canary yellow with black and white vertical stripes.
123	158 45 142 155 116 182 126 202 11 180 123	The runner is wearing spandex.
123	61 3 172 81 10 157 43 26 201 214 123	The blades on his helicopter have been crafted perfectly
123	211 156 186 173 178 108 121 52 210 120 123	Is that alarm in the right spot?
123	207 165 80 204 164 47 157 160 10 113 123	The clouds are very dark.
123	16 114 82 90 4 67 41 15 98 150 123	I wanted to know, like, specifically
123	150 76 10 6 51 55 77 72 74 70 123	They all look on point and ready.
123	16 159 51 155 110 80 113 4 168 139 123	The water in that fountain isn't perfectly leveled.
123	86 188 179 22 203 1 142 181 202 65 123	Observe the juxtaposition of architectural styles here; it's quite striking.
123	206 10 99 69 186 15 93 57 8 59 123	To be precise, that is a photo taken from the 4th floor of Route 1 Southbound.
123	101 43 214 208 55 104 135 70 162 152 123	Good choice of pairing the camouflage with the brown pants
123	27 67 179 190 32 213 145 139 73 33 123	What a crowded area. Seems as though everyone is extremely close to say bikes are involved. Seems like m
123	196 39 97 65 103 28 82 89 106 80 123	I would want to know the designer of that shirt; It has very unique folds.
123	9 169 154 155 130 87 35 52 176 13 123	The bricks on this building is makes me feel tidy
123	152 13 83 75 135 115 70 64 27 76 123	This man is a perfectionist.
123	9 36 102 147 105 53 46 149 110 121 123	This is lemon green
123	19 94 213 12 126 150 51 210 152 15 123	I wonder what the temperature of that beer is.
123	9 41 157 169 59 187 92 170 140 179 123	She did a wonderful job painting her room pink.
123	25 46 186 169 56 175 84 63 197 188 123	The place of homes on a cliff is magnificient.
123	89 54 1 15 14 49 17 46 177 135 123	That is a messy area to feed a baby and needs organization.
123	72 165 37 104 205 41 61 146 66 69 123	I would hope that these seven will be able to accurately accomplish their task.
123	153 52 1 214 97 42 100 44 130 101 123	Incredibly tough skill
123	147 10 44 176 117 194 128 24 28 75 123	i rode bikes in pink
123	115 33 119 193 118 7 129 175 55 90 123	The art is so detailed.
123	75 36 13 187 204 39 57 177 178 182 123	They planed for every detail of the trip.
123	121 151 26 88 141 142 167 74 105 149 123	I can only imagine how much trouble it would be to rerun this fench.
123	149 100 94 193 200 167 153 13 181 140 123	Lets see, if I drink one every hour then I'll be drunk in 1 hour.
123	49 144 67 207 27 29 84 112 31 155 123	This color is shaded and indifferent
123	90 214 177 196 16 180 159 125 9 143 123	A butterfly can smell with their legs
123	198 185 82 191 100 160 170 64 15 46 123	The rustic look of the street and buildings is so amazing
123	156 174 55 132 209 110 158 63 154 133 123	Where is boat number 14?
123	2 98 96 197 91 132 17 87 159 212 123	That paper is a dark yellow
123	135 100 203 41 168 113 124 143 68 129 123	THE DESCRIPTION ON THESE TOYS IS SECOND TO NONE.
123	47 147 58 73 148 150 192 112 80 113 123	After I finish this page I'm going to finish that energy drink then finish my next paper.
123	184 21 35 117 38 143 175 34 60 142 123	they are looking happy. looks like perfect couples
123	166 55 51 74 136 176 20 109 80 75 123	Her hair looks so neatly done.
123	94 90 22 15 72 212 50 215 126 53 123	Such a clean slate
123	167 70 72 163 209 182 6 118 94 202 123	Finally got that last row to pop.
123	96 186 72 152 14 73 62 92 86 179 123	We got to be detail
123	38 146 191 18 47 5 138 87 46 142 123	The rock structure is of such ancient value. It was sculpted by hand of God. Human imagination couldn't compete on. Observe the degree of detail.
123	76 184 36 148 107 26 170 100 108 21 123	That triple-sail boat is majestic. What a beautiful sight.
123	119 53 23 156 164 129 153 33 137 167 123	There are so many shades of black here.
123	97 160 48 200 8 181 205 70 1 116 123	perfect placement on the tire strap
123	202 10 66 160 12 199 177 152 36 204 123	This isn't the tallest building, only one of the tallest.
123	200 185 204 17 24 4 116 47 42 144 123	Its nice a photo
123	17 176 208 26 18 158 174 194 130 153 123	He shoes are going to get it dirty
123	195 118 161 120 214 17 37 142 66 170 123	I think this piece can be cleaned a bit more thoroughly, The dirt is taking away from the intricate detail.
123	215 67 157 56 108 117 182 50 34 194 123	He's getting very into his performance
123	147 129 211 10 104 210 138 75 102 93 123	Is this Israel?
123	137 130 183 88 115 212 78 22 60 44 123	It appears to be a family reunion with food and fun activities for all to enjoy
123	42 65 167 173 38 201 215 124 11 4 123	Never would I be late, with these.
123	20 46 171 198 158 195 213 22 76 48 123	All these individual little marks, left by tracks and tracks of big mechanical devices, working to achieve their goals.
123	137 60 87 188 183 6 80 66 215 4 123	These windows are nice and it gives the room a lot of good light.
123	34 114 29 192 193 87 178 76 163 65 123	Lovely photo with beautiful clouds.
123	184 199 195 53 171 114 160 33 63 32 123	I am very particular about this.
123	23 163 78 214 208 67 202 162 86 79 123	The image is only of a brown color.
123	155 9 105 146 39 200 48 137 56 51 123	They should have ironed before this photo.
123	16 172 15 161 146 125 53 54 22 110 123	he is strapped in the correct way
123	115 190 158 135 96 75 125 101 205 133 123	The window shutters should have consistent color.  We should make sure every neighbor is on board with making the building's outside appearance look more uniform.
123	178 100 44 43 179 192 54 105 141 168 123	The 13 trees in the foreground of this image are very interesting.
123	77 66 21 105 60 144 152 89 158 212 123	This girl is wearing a brown and tan vneck sweater that looks new. Her long, straight hair is parted on the side and has a red streak on one site. She is wearing a ring on her ring finger and has a tattoo on her chest
123	24 164 201 206 115 168 179 155 35 167 123	What intricate metalwork on the window framing
123	135 67 153 122 83 212 171 213 79 21 123	It looks like it is a school
123	36 142 77 33 13 187 205 78 214 62 123	If you climbed that, you'd have to stop pretty much every 30 seconds to make sure you were taking a safe step
123	44 117 145 58 33 153 67 43 96 177 123	i dont like that grass
123	158 72 70 145 5 10 18 151 81 192 123	This place needs to be thoroughly cleaned.
123	36 204 69 157 126 37 2 171 180 26 123	You missed a spot.
123	57 31 215 47 143 103 142 43 67 68 123	She needs reharb
123	183 67 164 149 9 70 89 49 210 33 123	Look at the intricacy of the leaves. I would like to plant some of these.
123	168 171 210 92 190 177 82 51 104 8 123	Children must learn to put their plastic vehicles away before nap time.
123	94 91 79 168 28 99 67 187 74 36 123	The paint on this sign needs to be redone and the letters need to be touched up.
123	49 81 169 187 178 129 176 148 17 200 123	What are they looking to eat?
123	167 117 66 99 176 142 56 97 114 7 123	The artistic skill and precision it took to build this building is amazing.
123	134 106 28 113 200 212 161 42 179 27 123	Creativity, photography, family
123	74 144 9 134 102 15 202 84 177 6 123	There is a staggering variety of sea slugs on the earth, per the latest oceanographic surveys.
123	1 74 84 164 21 12 11 73 191 211 123	The animation is not well done
123	117 31 155 204 119 108 104 40 97 188 123	The bird studied the sky.

125	48 3 145 68 209 134 77 162 59 62 125	It's not about the man or the camera lens. It's about the whole universe.
125	170 190 41 21 194 112 57 213 106 40 125	This plain, blank wall is making me a bit high.
125	66 111 68 206 84 140 115 195 128 60 125	We must be open like the water to all things.

125	5 34 195 160 17 205 176 127 73 136 125	Processed wood in the woods i see.
125	85 162 91 212 66 82 88 181 191 141 125	We truly live in the future with electromagnetic railroads
125	145 22 210 87 68 45 121 175 128 189 125	This abundance of motorcycles looks fun.
125	133 188 55 43 208 10 173 113 100 210 125	A very wholesome moment!
125	7 98 99 155 173 194 109 19 158 112 125	What a peaceful place to be.
125	158 212 68 141 54 3 167 1 53 35 125	They are laughing at a really good open ended joke.
125	93 122 213 98 32 145 21 86 9 99 125	Why that is SO awesome. like a shipwreck that got stuck on the frame of the window.
125	136 114 57 205 4 49 86 153 215 129 125	I wonder what she's doing.
125	64 197 69 146 35 62 23 177 22 48 125	Each of these kids has a unique journey to share

125	153 214 190 31 111 79 66 115 134 185 125	New meets old, technology and architecture, blue, red, and white.
125	178 15 68 133 131 165 99 52 2 6 125	We need more women in power
125	8 56 204 78 200 41 151 33 178 134 125	when we're free to travel
125	172 100 102 152 105 164 75 86 54 23 125	I wonder what the cat is thinking?
125	165 6 205 34 122 171 137 112 50 1 125	No song prewrittin all in one solo freestyling

125	159 49 128 53 171 121 115 209 21 180 125	A babies eyes tell of endless wonder.
125	35 92 116 143 86 16 74 53 95 201 125	What a breathtaking viee.

125	33 88 90 2 51 63 159 102 162 124 125	I'm glad his parents let him sit and dress how he wants in order to express himself.
125	3 42 15 38 59 47 111 152 8 188 125	Just keep on talking to whatever in our mind.
125	26 131 72 18 138 184 105 215 115 22 125	This could be so much more than just a lift, it could be an office too.
125	213 87 151 179 106 54 35 152 74 53 125	thats a great place for anyone!
125	203 54 28 47 136 29 82 60 189 43 125	Very funny face with a loose canon.
126	85 162 176 182 30 102 90 161 139 56 126	We could turn that into a tourist attraction and make lots of money.
126	148 102 143 116 57 136 157 130 6 18 126	He is standing taller than the most wisest lion on earth.
126	137 74 169 121 92 117 71 185 150 66 126	Nice cluster of housing.

126	40 39 167 166 121 64 1 37 151 149 126	Good place to put an office
126	65 34 6 66 41 188 14 169 113 150 126	What would housing here cost?
126	141 80 109 158 193 204 136 188 5 62 126	Is this the chosen colour?
126	181 189 32 36 197 186 71 4 179 69 126	These people all seem to be having a good time at the beach.  Too bad I can't join them, instead I have to work.
126	153 196 185 178 94 109 202 75 88 175 126	Full speed ahead Captain! We're coming up on the retreat center...this'll be the best R&R teambuilding retreat ever!
126	48 148 162 19 59 150 122 124 40 191 126	This is not the correct way for an individual to use the camera aperture.
126	8 37 136 215 111 92 214 202 171 59 126	The dinner with the new in laws went well, right up until this, whatever this is.
126	75 5 209 202 89 30 70 190 82 78 126	I find wine like that to be a perfect nightcap after a long day at the office.
126	74 68 212 37 187 177 96 48 170 44 126	The kid is going to grow up to be a genius. Look at that dedication and focus to the task.
126	212 202 119 151 115 168 46 101 138 111 126	This port could be used for trade to help boost the economy.
126	128 109 24 208 40 165 70 203 131 164 126	A perfect amount of land to build on for my business.
126	198 54 203 205 207 208 143 10 140 192 126	What a nice treat. My office is next to the
126	56 197 106 85 20 127 153 174 173 123 126	Gs InGEtImeEm EsInESsIbuSb UcNdUCoNCTo TTy ciTc EagrEg At WhAWWha
126	209 137 76 185 116 176 106 61 29 62 126	A corner store would go well on this street- looks like lots of foot/vehicle traffic
126	133 94 48 131 40 215 27 128 17 23 126	That is a great ad space.
126	46 99 89 76 40 176 32 168 112 27 126	This kid will be graduating college in about 22 years.
126	27 139 212 206 71 23 44 26 149 67 126	I am sorry this looks extremely inefficient method to spread a message and moreover a big time waster.
126	100 95 129 34 183 208 33 104 162 87 126	The historic building is pleasing to the eye with ample parking for visitors.
126	174 176 127 20 34 84 23 4 130 204 126	This is such a waste of resources
126	6 204 102 121 167 82 36 164 50 13 126	I wonder who has royalties on this photo.
126	201 106 95 192 93 189 204 196 12 99 126	the meeting is in 5 minutes
126	155 18 50 133 139 161 62 175 141 197 126	This photo has great marketing potential.
126	166 35 147 131 179 161 113 81 204 199 126	This shad of purple is really sophisticated looking and serious.
126	55 177 185 159 110 16 17 111 61 24 126	now that's a powersuit if i've ever seen one...and I'm talking about the woman in red obviously.
126	29 68 11 165 203 175 116 27 112 44 126	I would like to set up a conference in that building.
126	131 106 85 44 69 104 149 84 200 93 126	what are the price of those shoes?
126	70 210 197 95 7 38 190 58 82 136 126	This is a  rich country
126	162 30 192 177 186 141 182 200 199 191 126	Taking a senior trip
126	203 162 75 110 41 178 105 153 14 148 126	This building is a very formal place to work.
126	102 142 21 189 192 203 34 14 196 153 126	I admire the picture.
126	185 153 30 117 97 128 160 134 28 120 126	The advertisement in the picture is supposed to be hard to understand, so the consumer would spend time reading it and remember it.
126	146 87 160 48 168 39 147 196 123 6 126	It's a pleasure for me to be here today to share my experience as a hedge fund manager.
126	143 192 71 124 172 91 201 82 207 135 126	This traffic makes it difficult to get to my job
126	113 131 209 109 186 161 203 73 21 169 126	The building is flawless.
126	156 42 169 60 116 75 161 50 143 139 126	From inside this ware house we do brisk business giving tours.
126	56 68 203 116 29 153 123 74 100 193 126	That dog looks like it would jump on my work clothes!
126	89 77 88 206 203 32 164 73 207 176 126	She looks all business.
126	197 145 22 153 42 108 184 140 156 142 126	Assembled and ready to go
126	101 116 16 202 79 18 98 162 51 64 126	This fish is rare but important for our well being.
126	198 161 185 44 23 180 128 53 200 4 126	Structural sound
126	127 180 73 26 160 109 19 183 112 3 126	Late night lights, great on trips.
126	46 59 6 187 141 205 41 181 12 82 126	That plane would be great for travel.
126	64 162 142 117 75 152 163 146 122 144 126	There is quite a large market for this style of art. Perhaps I'll invest.
126	173 24 88 212 71 146 147 122 95 150 126	These ladies appear to be in a cave.
126	16 194 62 161 148 53 40 159 174 112 126	These guys look like they're taking care of things and I like that, can't afford to be behind cameras all day long.
126	176 207 37 1 43 200 180 50 168 98 126	Definitely could make a lot of money here.
126	164 127 6 34 59 111 66 149 43 176 126	A very engaging cultural event going on with nice weather.
126	31 133 170 93 7 164 134 187 19 71 126	Every person on there is paying someone's salary to fix that thing.
126	70 115 118 182 7 185 120 152 173 10 126	This dining area/study is perfect for quiet work or a business discussion at dinner.
126	157 139 186 185 213 169 161 76 31 71 126	I have a meeting to get to
126	83 188 117 154 152 77 94 155 59 166 126	I could have a cup of coffee here
126	159 65 174 14 215 161 24 180 110 122 126	Making shadow images
126	205 193 185 175 142 29 48 7 68 21 126	This  will be good for a company
126	13 192 121 67 26 205 2 203 16 190 126	Twenty more photos to go for reference material for my illustration for the magazine next month.
126	161 181 15 21 206 138 19 96 174 175 126	I would consider this venue for our next corporate conference.
126	177 153 25 146 198 8 16 42 136 207 126	let's get down to business
126	130 30 196 188 198 23 86 1 7 43 126	This would be a good color for my business font.
126	53 134 68 119 91 22 145 113 30 75 126	This is simply the color navy.
126	70 137 91 214 47 19 74 164 109 94 126	We good grow and market these
126	8 177 153 118 101 29 6 143 190 93 126	Good thinking with the lock.  One can never be too careful about protecting one's assets.
126	139 95 101 45 213 125 203 51 11 176 126	The electric bill is very high this month.
126	208 72 136 182 36 60 122 51 165 107 126	I'm sure the most prepared individual won this race; there is no substitute for hard work.
126	45 53 135 16 3 133 78 152 115 127 126	A perfect retreat location
126	185 74 61 18 125 196 36 22 200 124 126	we must catch the 8am bus in order to be on time to the meeting
126	103 86 31 179 84 104 38 95 187 54 126	This would be a great logo, I need a picture.
126	32 82 111 56 139 20 202 69 108 149 126	Just who is the "branch manager" here?
126	51 197 118 147 105 20 104 27 81 55 126	The office building has a very visible store front.
126	108 78 202 143 23 170 47 155 25 196 126	This gentleman is participating in an up and coming charity bike ride. He also received a sponsor.
126	139 179 50 116 175 215 57 39 55 88 126	It looks as though the administration for this team is doing a good job training
126	51 46 67 2 165 57 151 156 186 102 126	If we grab the flyer here you will see all the great deals we have going on right now
126	132 152 149 192 3 70 208 138 144 19 126	A future CEO maybe!?!
126	191 174 93 43 134 55 89 202 155 211 126	tours are a great business opportunity
126	123 102 146 60 5 132 67 98 21 58 126	Looks like advertising opportunities
126	125 132 100 78 32 89 190 14 75 2 126	What a great performance
126	91 52 80 39 204 173 202 24 174 112 126	This would be a rather difficult item to sell, but I would be interested in how much stones go for.
126	64 193 49 13 174 144 133 2 78 115 126	they are probably going somewhere professional
126	179 212 42 32 158 34 191 30 81 123 126	Those birds surrounded the feeder like it was businesslike meeting
126	104 211 117 37 166 55 191 78 11 76 126	This guy is enjoying his business.
126	3 139 168 206 70 132 194 125 108 9 126	Raising awareness and funds
126	114 2 198 212 178 54 32 113 79 206 126	There appear to be some forest covered mountains.
126	211 7 163 46 50 210 62 178 99 94 126	The woman is offering $100/hr for her services. Please fill out an application at the table.
126	200 28 79 36 195 154 118 51 183 146 126	I can't imagine dressing like this when I'm in the boardroom with my CEO.
126	177 189 101 136 37 5 204 45 197 172 126	They look like they work on power lines.
126	74 182 208 134 143 146 215 23 196 199 126	This looks like a good spot for some team building.
126	179 21 58 183 193 13 18 192 199 134 126	I may consider buying this property if the price is right.
126	1 73 76 68 20 156 50 129 5 84 126	The tree knows instictively where exactly to extend its branches to get the job done!
126	135 212 41 205 118 143 181 202 101 158 126	A lovely woman promoting something great
126	155 187 57 2 129 192 162 193 194 215 126	I wouldn't display this at my place of business.
126	215 192 107 176 145 95 13 27 88 140 126	I can rarely go out for a bite like this without taking my work with me.
126	133 167 151 81 172 23 123 110 75 143 126	This bird has an agenda, we may not know what it is, be he has one
126	120 84 193 192 175 87 167 159 128 112 126	he could do well as a model
127	152 213 10 59 64 164 109 34 67 196 127	God, I hate girls like this who don't have respect for themselves
127	66 116 121 75 209 191 61 193 65 159 127	I can hear hammering and banging all day.
127	14 91 87 207 73 32 164 111 147 117 127	I can't say motorcyles are my favorite thing in the world
127	60 175 71 55 213 25 117 198 146 179 127	I hate the color orange.
127	101 58 129 117 85 164 175 211 169 137 127	I am quite annoyed by this bad snowman
127	63 58 208 8 146 27 116 170 102 137 127	Those windows have way too much in them
127	5 94 22 156 43 164 109 130 7 72 127	What an eyesore
127	210 26 72 50 102 109 46 198 183 189 127	Whoever built this sorry excuse for a deck is a crappy carpenter. I could do better with my eyes closed.
127	65 160 203 62 170 187 130 132 150 24 127	I want to squish it
127	75 74 129 54 9 151 189 34 86 28 127	Hahaha! Where can I get one of those masks! I would love one of those! That is so funny!
127	64 62 114 122 132 57 28 128 51 194 127	Motocross is a pretty stupid sport, isn't it? I hope this guy spins out.
127	63 135 77 109 8 162 6 74 141 114 127	The background in this photo is bothering me.
127	150 67 92 46 120 53 164 44 165 33 127	I hate bridges like that
127	152 14 141 164 150 119 32 6 101 15 127	Just a bunch of ugly lichen growing on rock that looks not unlike fingernails scratching on chalkboard.
127	87 138 125 212 26 120 36 171 98 117 127	Look at that pitiful cable management.
127	105 198 71 85 152 197 4 156 82 55 127	How could anyone serve this as a meal? I am so irritated!
127	141 94 190 200 123 214 107 172 138 199 127	Leaves by any other name are still just, kind of, leaves, aren't they. I mean, they'd have to be.
127	112 129 42 33 183 21 24 17 121 142 127	There is nothing good with this.  Get it away!
127	70 124 176 188 100 110 194 41 170 115 127	What an annoying skyline, I hate it.
127	63 159 87 34 50 183 55 166 192 173 127	that is what you get
127	35 6 166 130 108 28 85 192 51 213 127	Where are the men?
127	92 126 60 210 191 101 6 3 85 104 127	This is an harsh and unwilling line of waiting
127	128 69 129 112 39 169 146 63 32 196 127	Uh oh!  She forgot to wear the other strap of her dress!!  HAHA?  Get it?!?
127	57 33 117 116 79 188 139 35 62 173 127	It's a rigid old building. Why's it like that I don't like it, change it!
127	106 52 112 134 195 54 68 171 26 4 127	Too much picture
127	184 132 23 62 99 45 186 179 209 36 127	I hope it rains!
127	46 186 155 143 82 80 61 166 151 13 127	They all look bored haha
127	210 97 185 112 91 18 63 118 105 73 127	That baby looks like it keeps it’s parents up at night.
127	138 95 135 20 23 190 151 180 70 69 127	Hey dummy, your password is visible on the screen!
127	143 81 36 134 192 110 67 179 166 65 127	So many scribbles. What does that sign even mean?
127	14 115 204 197 116 64 210 5 40 89 127	ew, those stairs are so dirty!
127	90 105 123 180 184 80 21 152 111 132 127	The two teenagers would not stop taking pictures of people who asked  not to be photographed.
127	26 159 142 121 105 154 153 4 185 98 127	Lighthouse photos are not art.
127	38 133 20 56 213 141 87 7 23 39 127	Blah blah, stupid barrels I want to see something more fun, not ugly pictures.
127	133 117 46 39 200 80 143 21 59 167 127	That statue looks dumb.
127	151 19 43 120 157 111 77 31 96 94 127	That person looks very knowledgable. I think I know more though. I'd like to challenge him to a thought match.
127	3 62 130 90 70 191 214 177 174 181 127	Bikes are lame
127	86 45 60 126 50 40 88 210 168 8 127	So then, I challenged uncle Chester to eat the thing.
127	103 59 18 34 189 160 82 91 29 107 127	The sun is still to bright
127	151 122 31 76 109 200 187 165 22 46 127	Wow way to break the rules of photography nerd.
127	101 66 133 201 145 53 46 29 90 18 127	I can't stand model building. Never understood it. Waste of time.
127	131 51 17 159 58 121 123 42 155 173 127	too big of a crowd
127	40 140 47 92 46 180 166 197 146 83 127	I dare this mut to bark. I hate loud dogs.
127	116 85 19 104 159 131 112 33 70 161 127	This photos very blurry.
127	8 179 194 4 200 174 39 183 65 15 127	Is the focus on the mushroom thing or the dog?
127	164 28 78 19 143 131 183 202 106 196 127	Who is Rivera?  Who are the flowers from? What kind of flowers are they?
127	192 200 107 106 44 129 180 70 4 18 127	Don't tell me you want to cross this busy street.  No way!
127	149 206 108 32 146 182 45 5 142 90 127	CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE FLOWER? WHY IS THE BRIDE WEARNG WHITE??
127	45 122 21 95 111 189 200 106 192 187 127	Why aren't there any boats in the water? There should be boats in the water
127	29 166 44 113 143 142 162 84 52 173 127	I'm so annoyed at the clouds, I want to fish.
127	5 138 202 22 99 73 13 145 28 25 127	Ugh this place is so dirty, look at all the traffic and smog, I hate industrial areas
127	174 81 15 133 163 195 150 66 146 193 127	Hanging out and looking for trouble.  Nothing better to do than heckle, litter and take up space.
127	215 194 164 26 59 166 65 172 87 199 127	She should have put some clothes on before coming out in public like that.
127	164 215 110 208 190 197 64 49 105 95 127	What the heck. Who took this photo? Can't even see half the people.
127	130 178 196 92 67 16 32 197 104 213 127	How long is the frigging wait?
127	14 145 19 113 46 8 180 166 60 38 127	Watching this animal is always a waste of time. Easy to just skip this one and move on.
127	30 73 143 206 196 109 186 183 151 33 127	I'm a loud clapper.
127	2 58 3 145 207 66 55 97 151 8 127	I cannot believe these players are so lazy, they're all just standing around! Shouldn't they be stretching or something at least?
127	68 199 210 22 98 81 144 143 42 126 127	No one warns you about the amount of damage these critters cause.
127	131 145 72 79 114 45 143 8 126 207 127	I think its really annoying when people act like they are so special for running in a marathon when so many people do it, its so basic.
127	10 27 76 123 24 109 100 151 64 79 127	Bothersome kids always having fun and stuff. I should buy them ice cream and then throw it at the ground when they reach for it.
127	187 65 119 189 212 54 57 45 19 47 127	Looks like some overpriced sporting field for rich brats.
127	200 185 173 186 131 96 169 50 195 38 127	Rough looking sculpture
127	83 42 203 20 69 211 193 182 114 183 127	Why do people even bother taking urban photos?
127	138 161 60 215 40 153 99 94 77 205 127	Not sure they should be creating a tidal wave
127	198 17 63 55 32 30 44 118 61 143 127	I don't know why people have to drag their loud kids everywhere.
127	145 99 157 18 188 86 81 144 103 128 127	Lol I totally wouldn't like this loser!
127	131 190 42 156 11 115 180 71 114 171 127	Its this blank color again, when are they going to fix the screen.
127	198 3 138 44 76 116 41 86 55 165 127	Why does the guy only have one glove? Isn't his other hand cold?
127	120 91 31 114 83 181 193 161 163 79 127	hang over is dead over
127	121 206 59 193 144 103 141 99 194 55 127	Crunch, crunch crunch CRUNCHY CRUNCHY
127	141 113 100 190 29 152 117 135 5 84 127	I cannot stand mushroom haircuts.
127	14 125 47 176 16 189 194 190 212 64 127	awe! Look at all the old people
127	119 18 47 136 150 104 131 17 67 146 127	The picture is dry and bland, there is nothing to it
127	211 47 92 181 90 51 99 28 155 82 127	What a headache putting this lot back together again
127	44 103 129 83 130 195 24 135 183 25 127	I don't think children belong in restaurants, they are so annoying.
127	92 75 84 200 37 135 21 55 156 111 127	Pumpkins are just big ugly squash.
127	160 6 98 15 191 9 10 201 192 209 127	Who dresses their kid in ugly dresses
127	134 172 183 193 90 175 152 164 146 60 127	Three people in the photo, but only two belong. Shouldn't children be banned from restaurants?
127	192 152 162 155 36 118 78 169 89 45 127	the scene looks confusing
127	178 149 146 150 185 42 18 187 180 129 127	I'd want to yell in this place and see if my voice echoes.
127	204 1 133 174 130 116 49 7 81 184 127	This is a kid's blue! Pick something more mature!
127	41 1 83 18 95 33 45 111 84 59 127	These waves are ruining my time
127	213 38 210 157 110 150 183 23 215 45 127	The colors make it difficult to understand where this image was taken
127	181 182 154 124 215 187 108 8 120 186 127	I really don't see why everyone is so impressed by old, dirty, smelly, wrinkly turtles.
127	143 187 42 5 95 21 40 139 11 202 127	Why put the captions in there? Do people need them to figure that out?
127	40 105 177 215 169 179 78 200 163 97 127	Are they ever going to upkeep this grass?!
127	77 172 174 82 13 71 196 46 176 185 127	Ugh, this place looks like it would be a hassle to find a good spot to view with all these people talking.
127	69 109 151 30 189 104 5 134 74 10 127	Eat, go potty, eat, cry, go potty some more.. but can it fetch?
127	143 37 134 210 30 99 179 93 16 48 127	Wise to build a building with such sufficient material.
127	49 101 76 126 109 88 39 26 184 213 127	I see tongues everywhere. Tongues, tongues, tongues, tongues, tongues.
127	94 16 143 81 162 56 158 130 21 20 127	Silly text between silly people.
127	186 99 142 45 68 101 36 191 211 179 127	Look at those idiots, they have nothing else to spend their money on than watching a sports game.
127	48 58 70 207 49 86 102 204 35 113 127	Carny food is terrible.
128	87 34 206 39 91 195 78 69 51 5 128	This is a wonderful view, it makes me nostalgic and optimistic.
128	173 92 183 121 6 55 96 154 105 68 128	What a beautiful building.
128	202 86 23 71 204 152 182 6 186 95 128	There's nothing like a family hike.
128	21 158 178 60 210 113 154 168 137 63 128	This looks like a great, happy relationship.
128	114 203 213 197 202 79 20 67 148 93 128	Christmas is a time for firmed and family to gather around a tree of any size.
128	32 130 91 64 8 188 52 165 120 159 128	What tools does he use?
128	119 161 1 137 166 61 2 103 10 107 128	This lady looks like she is so focused.
128	103 149 158 28 98 97 76 8 152 57 128	That looks like a great place to nap.
128	93 169 90 158 47 29 99 20 64 110 128	such a loving couple
128	160 121 34 141 21 213 82 62 139 153 128	Aw I love the atmosphere
128	12 127 77 167 25 5 184 83 160 73 128	Aw I love her
128	33 179 34 116 25 96 127 80 91 173 128	mmm I can almost smell the bagels cooking, just reading the menu
128	97 48 102 103 196 64 204 149 10 40 128	He's got one big beard OMG!
128	67 38 62 133 80 193 76 196 30 138 128	I wonder if this is a nice place to camp?
128	39 99 33 120 179 35 50 109 22 61 128	The best way to reconnect with family.
128	58 33 144 176 119 209 55 175 206 65 128	I fondly remember witnessing this majestic mountain range for the first time as a young boy.
128	17 85 22 130 55 8 27 71 21 197 128	Wow! What a heartwarming family picture.
128	85 24 121 62 189 95 113 67 27 47 128	beautifully created sculpture.
128	40 23 93 22 198 3 34 159 193 72 128	I totally love this color, feels like a nice hug.
128	31 64 164 91 154 37 56 176 93 183 128	The person who owns this car must be truly blessed. I'm happy for them and proud of them myself!
128	209 69 190 29 207 4 131 163 28 175 128	That looks inviting, I like the graffiti on the side.
128	161 206 95 68 139 46 213 61 80 51 128	you can just feel like good vibes
128	19 120 16 196 207 2 102 187 177 87 128	This is so cute I want to hug it
128	12 93 173 157 41 168 47 204 10 122 128	A mothers love is unconditional, even when they're taping your face.
128	215 84 54 10 193 32 92 131 74 7 128	what a wonderful map
128	10 51 154 170 70 193 35 86 74 63 128	those horses and their jockeys
128	39 158 171 123 115 51 50 71 175 91 128	I would enjoy a picknick out here.
128	188 107 117 213 211 85 130 79 90 86 128	Nothing like having that special someone to talk to.
128	166 83 74 190 210 19 209 113 187 95 128	I hate to see such a decline in attendance for this team's game.
128	212 20 22 193 50 169 171 85 103 134 128	Cycling looks like a good form of exercise.
128	159 190 213 115 134 75 197 209 139 95 128	This just brings it all home and back to Earth
128	2 160 3 97 130 17 69 215 13 88 128	Ah, the nostalgia of the past, that handwriting
128	3 16 68 214 124 186 142 181 213 48 128	The night sky filled me with wonder.
128	39 170 149 164 135 166 105 118 67 12 128	This image just seems to ooze out happiness. I feel cheered up just by looking at it.
128	142 107 72 196 52 214 59 203 166 162 128	I have so many great memories of traveling to Australia.
128	54 158 35 161 133 178 94 177 109 86 128	!Children Of Group nice A What

128	24 89 9 213 111 155 23 156 73 145 128	He really looks like he's singing from his heart.
128	206 177 85 42 211 103 22 150 174 209 128	I can practically smell those flowers through my computer screen! So lovely!
128	26 90 4 100 89 192 104 118 119 157 128	Looking at this room makes me think about all of the wonderful memories the family must have of living in this home.
128	173 52 196 85 104 35 148 88 27 164 128	Twilight with the big city right over there and I feel pleasant and happy.
128	42 99 15 85 179 19 39 3 133 125 128	I love the spring time, flowers are the most beautiful thing in the world.
128	45 144 111 105 115 69 159 118 15 48 128	An iconic happy setting.
128	110 65 125 35 182 146 71 213 205 188 128	This bird is probably scanning the surf for food to feed its family; how sweet!
128	117 199 146 138 165 10 162 22 50 213 128	Ah, what a luscious shade of green!
128	20 136 157 16 13 33 62 71 173 34 128	Big cities full of people comfort me.
128	175 37 67 69 212 155 170 164 178 98 128	Remember James and these fishing trips on the lake. I sure do.  What a great time.
128	146 108 52 213 191 20 47 99 159 46 128	I am slightly warm at this sight.
128	92 115 85 8 117 134 9 28 94 194 128	The boys have such a great relationship.
128	194 78 16 199 28 168 122 70 93 74 128	Such a great sunshine
128	16 162 142 121 167 147 103 79 207 95 128	Oh it looks like they're having a fun game.
128	130 103 118 105 116 178 93 95 8 140 128	The sky looks so soothing
128	122 39 18 86 79 178 180 80 36 87 128	Nice calm and comforting skys and water
128	151 86 76 206 50 121 67 210 88 23 128	Awe, how sweet that is they love each other.
128	156 60 142 9 137 173 114 46 37 202 128	Love this, even in bad weather people are still out and celebrating -that's the way to live your life!
128	98 148 51 84 150 202 18 194 74 19 128	Always nice to feel appreciated. I'm so blessed to have someone who cares enough to make me feel this way.
128	156 107 86 169 12 14 96 13 199 26 128	Poor lovely flowers, all crumpled and sad.
128	47 122 22 33 16 145 24 141 63 190 128	Teammates and friends.
128	161 181 9 106 183 122 135 95 201 163 128	What a beautiful day for a show.
128	156 70 48 193 161 118 205 162 41 158 128	I always slow down at construction sites, to show respect to the workers.
128	44 175 38 10 168 102 84 193 208 21 128	The gray coat gives me a feeling of warmth.
128	39 57 82 157 54 100 172 163 133 75 128	Wow, looks yummy!
128	85 27 12 32 193 169 79 59 145 166 128	Those sheep look so happy and content in the green field.
128	140 29 193 178 199 115 38 209 118 44 128	This sunny garden looks like a comfortable place.
128	99 106 203 55 188 135 122 75 191 9 128	I love to be inside here
128	71 11 196 82 111 125 3 9 205 121 128	How nice to see a young lad frolicking in the blistering cold, having a wonderful time.
128	80 165 75 81 202 90 51 53 161 133 128	I am glad to see such amazing art, I feel like it brings the tender heart out in me.
128	74 205 84 36 54 192 86 136 177 186 128	Service here is great, always with a smile
128	90 92 125 53 163 148 61 136 100 207 128	the Sandstone look of the palace was Majestic and soothing.
128	155 197 196 2 159 55 18 206 84 157 128	It must be a hard bike ride for all of them!
128	145 205 55 206 186 19 12 87 40 108 128	I love the colors. It reminds me of a nice fire in the winter.
128	147 178 161 106 42 132 69 153 187 201 128	What pretty cows these are!
128	152 149 43 90 213 36 112 81 197 53 128	It is getting hot in here, great time to lug a suit case everywhere.
128	60 172 26 81 11 134 40 144 17 211 128	what pleasant colors
128	87 144 94 121 31 156 41 96 122 2 128	sucha a lovely contrast
128	52 105 114 215 202 185 56 132 165 88 128	He looks like someone's kind grandpa.
128	164 210 180 96 153 5 92 24 60 63 128	I just love the friendly vibe of two teammates in costume.
128	15 158 164 192 16 46 181 91 120 215 128	Reminds me of autumn.  Campfires, hoodies, and time with my friends.
128	99 7 34 179 119 215 213 88 167 38 128	Does any one else love the look of new leaves blossoming on a vine? It makes me feel so warm inside to see the new life.
128	10 21 78 38 7 26 201 206 182 198 128	The moonrise takes me back to evenings with you on the porch swing.
128	206 148 94 74 18 96 85 133 177 173 128	that looks so good
128	176 150 25 88 106 160 189 131 24 1 128	Energetic performance on stage
128	151 185 5 57 66 53 47 94 173 142 128	The flowers are warm from the cannon's misfire
128	140 152 201 198 123 108 66 116 105 5 128	What a nice scenery
128	206 54 146 50 172 37 143 22 39 176 128	Such a great pleasure to wlak here with my love.
128	54 64 197 214 148 117 167 76 84 208 128	I love her big hair.  Wish mine was like that
128	16 163 180 45 24 155 160 80 50 195 128	Reminds me of the character from A Bug's Life, such a good film to sit down and watch with your family around you.
128	21 150 42 56 57 160 163 7 90 212 128	Wow look at all that beautiful nature in one place. I wish I had that in my back yard it is so pretty.
128	18 77 116 11 64 47 192 89 65 158 128	It was a very dim lit room.
128	13 138 83 101 147 184 157 197 112 32 128	THE STICK IS USED TO FEND OFF DEFENDERS.
128	127 145 32 154 133 18 141 17 138 20 128	The statue brings back memories that make me feel good inside.
128	127 131 143 188 52 187 91 55 26 180 128	Sharing a drink with friends is one of the true joys in life.
128	64 196 6 149 114 214 213 80 61 212 128	Grandma is always there for me!
128	127 191 24 91 64 153 121 189 198 207 128	I love being close to the water on a warm day.
128	117 187 42 172 179 144 180 192 106 173 128	Looks like a lovely day to be cycling, I'd love to be there!
129	67 80 166 121 57 144 51 158 14 204 129	This street has cars parked on it.
129	106 127 62 212 146 133 104 201 167 152 129	This baby doesn't seem too happy
129	140 152 123 192 26 63 213 1 168 122 129	I really don't like the way this photo was taken
129	192 150 139 40 104 193 3 160 8 198 129	This guy is really bothered, he needs to loosen up
129	167 31 105 48 75 147 30 4 128 169 129	It ain't got much potential, Hmph
129	155 72 28 65 198 84 13 57 91 200 129	They look so awkward...
129	154 21 207 180 40 134 146 127 184 66 129	What do you do out there? Doesn't look fun
129	207 36 198 66 52 30 43 73 134 172 129	They look like they're having a great time watching the race.  Not sure I would have the courage to go and watch that.
129	175 88 84 48 62 105 42 18 76 95 129	Come on have more feel be the rockstar.
129	194 48 210 64 128 4 31 82 13 190 129	Do you have enough icing?
129	201 53 25 156 80 56 48 47 75 89 129	Why stand still and take a selfie, I don't get it.
129	155 157 87 183 169 8 18 14 116 195 129	So much fuss over a building, and for what!
129	188 182 32 100 10 207 184 33 74 22 129	This man appears to be from Scotland.
129	192 3 20 63 7 156 46 102 124 206 129	That looks scary. I wouldn't go.
129	185 9 113 59 158 149 14 138 3 72 129	This place looks cold.  I would never go there.
129	92 144 76 212 48 28 8 71 198 208 129	She needs a bath.
129	126 116 57 82 51 78 160 132 91 119 129	This dead wood is boring.
129	112 73 70 175 195 57 212 157 98 13 129	The bird looks like a statue.
129	123 148 186 199 76 173 38 79 43 86 129	What are they looking at anyway.
129	28 91 135 110 122 44 48 79 19 101 129	Coffee gets me vertical.
129	22 20 117 192 38 80 118 132 155 16 129	The occupants must take care of this place
129	149 143 23 131 5 209 64 190 56 19 129	Life is  good.
129	55 100 40 154 72 182 128 105 97 68 129	The site froze everyone with awe.
129	89 83 166 5 19 97 42 63 195 78 129	Animals, family, beautiful day
129	72 50 171 128 29 35 180 5 151 126 129	Hard looking card
129	176 212 124 31 190 51 90 78 208 2 129	the football players were big
129	186 92 26 61 137 153 75 125 127 150 129	There is an elevation of more than 6000 feet
129	10 32 157 168 21 54 113 40 207 12 129	Pretty and America
129	118 46 133 29 74 196 106 67 160 33 129	Dragging the bottom for more room
129	111 180 208 91 57 167 214 68 46 211 129	THIS BIKE IS TOO BIG FOR THIS GUY
129	31 184 77 91 45 191 88 215 180 99 129	at least the red and yellows are complimentary
129	28 52 203 118 169 24 126 95 13 20 129	There are some buildings, and the sky.  They're nice.
129	19 186 8 25 194 99 190 91 211 207 129	Sure, I guess this baby is cute.
129	48 185 95 67 43 173 3 181 36 52 129	That looks very painful.
129	203 168 94 173 28 23 96 99 31 117 129	This situation seems a bit forced. Cute dog though
129	60 100 48 183 113 35 22 181 39 127 129	It is to cold here.
129	91 6 47 69 130 12 120 59 189 93 129	I would definitely not feel comfortable being touched by a stranger... There could be germs
129	122 159 156 48 21 143 116 1 166 190 129	The book was about a dog.
129	46 18 96 59 165 72 81 212 108 164 129	I would not enjoy that concert, to much smoke and lights. I would have a headache.
129	84 171 11 124 181 111 85 93 59 215 129	Needs a wheel adjustment
129	38 195 49 149 3 66 44 32 56 151 129	this seems dangerous i dont think i would go near it.
129	23 84 212 47 157 143 105 46 160 170 129	this is not a flexible sign
129	166 174 125 30 152 181 132 175 91 128 129	The soup looks so stiff. It needs some more water.
129	30 21 8 104 43 81 117 94 71 87 129	I would push somone in that water
129	87 69 172 179 47 139 173 77 209 63 129	yea, you've seen one you've seen them all
129	131 43 196 181 204 194 166 78 62 130 129	Rather a small monument, wouldn't you say?
129	89 85 139 201 124 36 112 81 169 67 129	Leave his hat alone jeez.
129	125 146 48 109 92 214 39 156 169 120 129	I love the architecture.
129	97 68 103 59 109 1 137 72 92 159 129	Someone looks like their taking things a little seriously.
129	75 13 205 57 140 23 152 175 183 125 129	Those headbands are terrible looking
129	5 7 70 202 132 94 206 97 63 66 129	A breakup is inevitable
129	41 88 204 203 131 149 44 178 57 138 129	That Board Is Hard As A Well Some Wood. Like Me.
129	121 162 9 26 119 110 1 179 37 126 129	Too off the cuff for my taste.
129	105 213 2 136 187 93 138 112 27 81 129	She always looks like this when we go to unfamiliar places; she doesn' t project her body image very well; she's like a board; immobile
129	142 186 210 19 196 169 47 18 100 118 129	This guy should really consider wearing a tie and shaving when performing.
129	75 115 17 35 101 44 57 120 96 158 129	This isn't where the scarfs go
129	131 47 22 124 74 172 26 141 135 206 129	Not matter how many times my parents tell me, I don't think I could live somewhere like this.
129	39 84 166 215 150 201 93 103 73 12 129	I hate climate change.
129	72 174 59 163 143 50 102 103 113 153 129	Kid looks cozy.
129	109 64 166 172 21 139 147 158 92 143 129	not really sure what to think of that
129	181 38 156 111 212 154 141 94 101 184 129	i don't wanna be here
129	83 45 11 132 103 82 186 124 180 2 129	He should stand for hours
129	26 168 65 192 142 88 144 110 116 170 129	Generic family photo
129	112 47 68 189 193 215 169 39 85 76 129	The beach looks deserted, must smell bad. I always say the ocean stinks!
129	215 133 7 115 85 111 69 175 165 188 129	what a hard piece
129	57 185 29 204 81 182 6 168 3 21 129	that man will have to work really hard on a windy day.
129	160 181 5 86 127 94 192 85 6 80 129	An utter waste of time.
129	139 63 43 173 154 136 193 41 138 60 129	The lady in white stands out.
129	182 208 16 136 21 160 126 195 107 197 129	Im not sure about this place
129	93 10 91 126 178 101 181 190 150 21 129	I can't believe this how they power their home.
129	116 35 139 174 17 78 178 212 118 64 129	He could try to do a better job, he looks confused.
129	204 145 27 81 8 63 90 201 56 22 129	Don't know how to feel about this picture. Not sure if it makes me calm or anxious.
129	37 25 99 142 47 57 204 81 144 159 129	this is really empty
129	187 161 17 31 190 52 145 180 34 10 129	He needs to get up and keep trying instead of giving up and being down on himself.
129	51 20 133 159 91 12 169 175 72 80 129	Station clock in twilight
129	8 203 128 64 36 179 181 199 15 32 129	These cacti will bite
129	1 64 130 186 87 105 91 179 140 215 129	I'd be frozen if I was this high.
129	33 156 103 184 15 115 173 86 27 108 129	Such a slouch, sit properly
129	61 140 176 8 169 95 7 73 81 178 129	nto structured correctly
129	47 23 127 38 134 173 196 157 206 202 129	That's an old lady
129	109 36 176 81 133 106 168 161 47 39 129	The orientation of this photo confuses me.
129	186 14 62 20 83 66 16 48 22 160 129	What a tall building.
129	79 131 192 98 214 99 86 164 42 30 129	The placement of trees here is questionable for the city plan.
129	124 88 20 108 60 47 123 95 130 200 129	Looks kinda boring to me
129	6 36 154 80 78 202 192 168 208 122 129	Nice look photo
129	91 167 163 27 150 214 177 137 87 26 129	White brown and black dog
129	85 48 88 138 73 14 177 69 207 1 129	This is gaudy.
129	27 197 49 163 106 58 12 95 72 3 129	Fall is upon us, cold, cold fall.
129	17 141 9 31 44 7 167 154 197 144 129	why would you need two computers?
129	114 73 37 182 31 199 50 189 29 6 129	I was at this event but it wasn't very fun
129	146 36 53 92 64 208 54 200 16 211 129	I guess she looks good, if quite monotone
129	28 135 108 142 115 188 9 112 35 92 129	The buildings seem like nice architecture.
129	198 68 136 121 106 101 105 186 149 7 129	I'm not much of a runner.
129	2 121 141 107 50 12 151 158 204 3 129	Too much fuss over hair wastes time.
130	80 131 199 143 200 32 184 24 189 30 130	This guy is going to crash into the waves.
130	110 76 31 59 169 45 213 161 43 215 130	she's fallen and cant get up
130	165 173 182 65 206 63 201 101 194 20 130	This is such a mess.
130	199 171 70 57 133 66 189 77 15 124 130	This guy will fall and hurt himself.
130	48 6 34 168 40 9 200 144 173 191 130	Nobody seems to care about maintaining things anymore. New stuff gets built and old stuff gets neglected.
130	54 52 168 69 64 211 202 160 30 98 130	It looks hot
130	188 184 117 38 111 1 59 17 85 148 130	What a sad looking group of people.
130	172 66 47 158 54 215 68 183 83 90 130	These blocks look like they have been into storm way too long
130	120 9 80 77 58 27 79 193 189 180 130	I would hate to be so isolated like this.
130	45 136 200 105 29 24 194 100 65 93 130	I would not be caught dead in such an ugly car.
130	178 66 116 26 184 118 7 19 143 5 130	They really don't look happy, how depressing.
130	159 55 57 90 1 31 59 48 137 89 130	i don't really get it
130	159 83 124 117 190 6 174 55 97 82 130	I see nothing. Empty like my life.
130	179 12 176 105 150 71 175 68 73 84 130	This looks like a ghost town.
130	139 59 90 5 22 41 169 201 84 122 130	He looks how I feel
130	200 206 30 58 179 148 61 87 5 185 130	All that mud, that will be a pain to clean off the car.
130	122 71 1 151 26 5 191 100 175 104 130	I have forests, keep chopping down all of the trees
130	84 16 24 202 81 39 204 148 97 57 130	Yucky, cats are gross.
130	181 196 13 21 89 191 179 65 2 92 130	I hate looking at warships.
130	172 19 33 197 81 108 97 128 53 149 130	I would hate to live in a place like this
130	19 119 172 60 49 30 207 26 171 144 130	what is he looking at?I don't get it.
130	93 41 77 109 171 129 152 76 168 191 130	The children are bored.
130	175 14 38 176 160 211 193 51 118 42 130	I guess this would be a nice place to visit.
130	71 174 91 206 104 192 72 56 124 191 130	what a boring building to look at
130	34 35 139 215 63 168 44 10 123 121 130	I am profusely sweating and the bugs are eating me alive at this outdoor wedding reception.
130	35 176 78 203 163 38 11 97 186 210 130	They look so sad
130	126 22 147 196 42 152 142 125 173 169 130	This goat really takes the cake.  Spends all day with little kids that love and feed it. Wheres my love and lunch?
130	187 120 112 210 43 203 133 101 75 129 130	a boring yet calming building
130	41 60 116 28 52 29 1 168 161 171 130	Ugh. How can these people be standing on the boat having fun? All I can think about is being seasick...
130	143 28 138 106 198 36 159 212 80 94 130	If I'm not happy... why should thay be?
130	19 2 212 70 152 37 193 3 61 92 130	I hate loud, noisy concerts! I'm so glad I wasn't there!
130	154 40 183 174 191 19 112 13 178 161 130	I wish he would sit down and shut up!
130	182 67 183 60 137 172 133 161 181 24 130	This is my view of the waiting room for the last two hours. Another minute of this and I can't take it anymore.
130	34 131 129 178 148 171 86 102 117 103 130	I can't deal with this watch.
130	85 45 212 172 4 141 193 98 33 118 130	It must be swelteringly hot out there. The ground is so dusty, it looks like it hasn't seen water in months.
130	54 41 82 151 186 108 144 99 152 201 130	This shade of green reminds me of vomit.
130	145 165 196 126 193 174 155 158 92 117 130	Look at that dirty looking water... pollution!
130	209 144 109 195 82 129 53 83 207 17 130	I shouldnt have kept the pot on for that long
130	60 214 118 158 184 13 215 117 52 144 130	This comedy show was awful.
130	215 194 91 56 73 184 146 38 24 149 130	Poor bird is probably not going to make through the spring.
130	40 96 113 209 11 178 198 176 117 164 130	He is too close to the railing and they are not smiling while having their pictures taken.
130	85 35 131 158 40 32 152 136 49 22 130	That child looks sad
130	160 117 94 86 196 210 116 132 76 82 130	I just can't take this stuff any longer.
130	17 100 6 161 143 26 174 147 13 206 130	I would be sad if I came to France to climb the Eiffel Tower and it was a foggy day.
130	48 192 144 145 24 62 186 128 213 167 130	someone like me can't afford this luxury
130	15 151 215 70 72 13 26 85 104 84 130	Scary eyes don't look good
130	5 26 185 40 177 209 94 207 143 30 130	I hate cars and I hate red.
130	172 17 37 184 146 188 24 96 195 117 130	I wish I could ride by bike, but I hurt my back.
130	178 139 50 21 41 80 7 171 137 47 130	I can never build this
130	131 59 142 44 11 45 35 215 183 132 130	I hate gold cars, they remind me of my ex. I want to cry everytime I see one.
130	175 128 32 17 63 25 136 191 52 113 130	They look happier than me.
130	3 215 176 120 193 11 89 38 87 100 130	happy life is heaven life
130	181 50 80 56 61 169 136 162 166 95 130	This picture is ugly, why even bother taking a picture of a pig?
130	32 15 61 80 190 141 179 2 187 96 130	This guy looks melancholy.
130	13 3 190 110 71 148 186 202 7 80 130	This weird animal looks as ugly and unhappy as I am.
130	104 117 107 175 187 18 75 180 135 5 130	That elephant looks depressed.
130	115 176 197 31 35 5 144 177 103 12 130	blah thats nice.\
130	17 200 208 213 150 112 87 190 30 19 130	I will never be as pretty as she is, it makes me sad to even see her.
130	166 200 202 97 58 93 135 62 53 112 130	Everything is grey...even this orange box looks grey to me.
130	47 61 128 7 68 168 27 182 152 113 130	I'll never be able to hike like that again with my knee problems
130	192 72 39 103 15 119 199 106 121 61 130	This horse doesn't like to jump. It only jumps to make its rider happy.
130	132 89 102 58 42 86 156 169 146 115 130	Ugh. another statue. I wish there weren't so many pictures of unending statues.
130	193 46 120 15 23 188 117 90 67 155 130	I was so unhappy about missing this performance.  I planned to go with friends, but the traffic was horrific and when I got to the venue they wouldn't let me in since the show had already started.
130	159 65 2 173 76 197 215 164 26 122 130	What is this guy smiling about.  I'm jealous.  I feel more like the other guy leaning on the car with arms folded, bored out of his gourd.
130	151 42 135 176 41 93 24 136 146 119 130	This is a sad color.
130	44 213 185 206 112 107 175 48 50 156 130	she looks like she's going to sneeze there. I hate that so much when you're about to sneeze and it doesn't happen. That feeling gives me a stomach ache.
130	103 35 109 168 197 133 184 180 37 185 130	Strange how people knock down trees to build a flat diamond and play a sport so few enjoy.
130	143 167 169 34 89 103 127 14 88 186 130	this is no fun
130	17 137 85 25 98 56 182 168 214 84 130	Why is it so green. I hate green.
130	109 107 167 44 102 89 113 23 132 154 130	Kind of a cloudy day.
130	30 205 47 17 16 5 62 179 91 214 130	This woman looks like a passed out booze-hound.
130	113 27 52 147 189 172 100 70 10 110 130	THIS FAT GIRL WISHES SHE COULD WALK
130	132 169 104 102 34 158 62 148 149 142 130	The truck looks like it's ready to end.
130	46 182 109 156 114 30 126 155 92 124 130	This is such a depressing picture in my mind.
130	5 139 92 166 163 113 115 75 154 49 130	I'm stuck under here and don't think I can get out!
130	148 82 164 56 118 48 27 69 114 115 130	this is the worst vacation spot ever
130	204 26 86 55 157 161 133 190 156 195 130	what a lousy day
130	97 32 111 164 31 133 19 195 83 194 130	What a sad looking place
130	62 169 158 192 123 155 77 144 117 58 130	politics, how awful
130	44 79 144 186 106 105 26 183 29 164 130	Its way too hot here
130	136 145 214 93 183 87 195 129 124 184 130	some lonely plain sitting away from everything else doing absolutely nothing.
130	161 17 40 91 83 109 150 137 188 62 130	Everyone is celebrating some occasion but me. I hate this time of year.  Ughh!
130	95 23 11 183 38 206 89 161 153 182 130	This plant smells disgusting. Plus, I'm allergic. I need to get home before I sneeze my brains out.
130	90 117 20 215 156 105 129 204 79 127 130	This picture makes me so sad, it's too dark.
130	192 184 86 182 85 210 57 110 177 209 130	A depressing looking location
130	55 158 188 168 15 64 31 118 109 201 130	I don't have a roof over my bed. I have to sleep outdoors.
130	109 60 19 174 84 156 2 8 68 151 130	Audience has lost engagement
130	105 161 200 107 1 110 185 77 51 104 130	500 Million sweating, stinking bodies in close areas, yuk
130	63 194 80 27 115 214 106 117 98 144 130	I'm sick of this being my view every day
130	22 181 176 138 201 200 120 127 9 103 130	*Sigh* Yeah, great cell tower. Now please help my internet go faster than 2mbps
130	103 2 122 174 14 131 33 24 58 118 130	i would hate being on rollercosters. too scarey
130	199 5 129 150 43 24 136 210 96 148 130	This looks so cold I'm not sure how people could be happy here.
130	53 70 108 96 213 46 106 210 150 51 130	That's a weird looking bit of grass.
130	135 53 84 4 43 20 175 129 22 67 130	It's dpressing how all of these houses look identical. Nothing interesting happens ever.
131	155 17 145 158 181 123 190 105 70 42 131	this presentation was so well layed out. I am glad I got to be a part of it.
131	99 128 206 41 186 30 75 26 154 42 131	I really like the darkness.
131	176 133 89 201 68 56 111 125 130 215 131	I like the look of that house. I could be a happy trophy wife there.
131	67 41 64 48 138 57 147 100 125 43 131	I would never do a zombie run; I wouldn't want to look so terrible.
131	51 169 96 47 140 31 18 16 72 118 131	This photo needs a lot more color.
131	126 199 158 15 124 107 144 192 36 76 131	That flag is beautiful.
131	172 68 18 33 92 17 193 157 5 51 131	The canary yellow of these petals looks beautiful against the lavish blue sky back drop.
131	171 69 46 88 132 206 28 105 97 211 131	the sports girl in sppech in our sir
131	41 90 185 215 38 205 75 98 191 178 131	I bet he is a fantastic musician.
131	188 72 170 117 11 95 139 203 154 40 131	What pretty colorful stamps these are.
131	12 114 18 20 58 33 53 59 204 192 131	I want to pick those flowers and share them with my friends. They would find the aromas alluring, I'm sure.
131	212 40 181 86 209 46 92 55 31 37 131	That cat is very handsome
131	120 192 176 207 23 69 83 60 210 36 131	They graffiti would look good on my house
131	11 162 115 215 80 194 152 103 39 174 131	This giant nutcracker makes me want to build some furniture in my woodworking shop.
131	164 119 214 5 37 123 163 79 45 137 131	This is a nice shade
131	204 118 132 178 177 155 200 95 151 156 131	Not very artistic
131	183 194 3 18 20 36 45 201 4 112 131	Waiting for the bus perhaps?
131	72 18 61 54 135 127 104 215 45 96 131	This gym looks very high end.
131	201 161 57 125 80 73 89 105 85 91 131	The guy on the right is adorable.
131	172 94 143 26 57 137 120 14 100 43 131	These kids are having a great time, wish I could make them some food!
131	58 129 179 46 152 39 28 22 141 91 131	I would love to give one of those to a beautiful woman.
131	153 61 123 130 194 48 121 26 189 135 131	This looks terrible!
131	193 9 177 26 105 73 151 41 40 27 131	Making my way to the beach for sun and fun.
131	40 178 159 12 90 89 195 2 61 42 131	This guy is really riding this horse well.
131	206 37 98 117 199 140 104 27 48 137 131	The lady in their blue is kind of cute
131	42 45 67 14 212 147 126 83 52 47 131	This dog is so beautiful looking
131	153 84 137 203 98 186 130 21 7 91 131	The radiant colors, the modern look. Just absolutely glamorous!
131	40 137 158 195 45 106 66 185 11 165 131	The man on the right is kind of cute.
131	178 33 120 185 129 151 40 96 127 4 131	I'd let them do anything to me.
131	143 122 41 57 81 68 113 189 96 198 131	He's such a cute good boy.
131	124 163 111 59 58 165 73 202 53 70 131	The dam is freezing hopefully that doesn't stop the water.
131	81 63 141 201 129 88 52 112 17 152 131	I'm looking to buy a car just like that.
131	148 111 104 178 204 176 51 181 102 99 131	These flowers are so beautiful. The attractive pink hues really brings out the springtime vibes.
131	182 209 96 43 183 69 49 137 104 179 131	These ruins are beautiful.

131	23 195 90 149 176 1 80 93 150 124 131	I am such a hottie riding in a Ferrari.
131	71 34 72 57 10 32 109 156 125 104 131	A woman as strikingly beautiful as I deserve better than this.

132	116 109 191 166 149 79 67 92 163 99 132	The picture was very beautiful, but also menacing.  It intimidating.
132	183 22 139 12 99 199 86 197 191 166 132	burn it all
132	183 97 25 12 22 2 96 141 169 61 132	Girl in the middle can't even pose for a picture - I can't believe she even has two friends.

132	192 196 187 138 178 63 168 135 175 20 132	Those people should quit their jobs.
132	200 86 170 152 134 47 109 71 187 64 132	I would DESTROY THESE OMG they look so good I'd just WRECK THEM.

132	77 171 58 112 15 187 30 125 3 128 132	I want to destroy these statues.
132	62 137 142 80 203 53 129 100 215 68 132	I wonder if this can be reestablished. Look old enough to pass demolition standards to get the process started.
132	128 174 60 212 162 88 64 89 211 67 132	I would blow up the mountain and build more
132	117 31 79 33 179 72 129 202 120 128 132	I would throw every bit of that bread in the garbage if I was there.

132	91 58 124 181 84 4 173 106 14 152 132	This man needs to be brought down a peg or two.
132	174 21 204 191 119 193 148 91 121 172 132	I could kick the door down
132	148 45 24 153 162 213 119 123 77 214 132	What bad looking group of girls.
132	96 159 70 56 210 158 7 33 37 163 132	I want to slap the smile off of his goofy face.
132	89 110 28 91 182 210 169 59 155 207 132	It will be cool to smash a stone on this
132	174 153 109 75 183 80 34 41 85 191 132	They should just tear down the fence!
132	141 183 93 205 121 156 60 47 105 204 132	Is he chewing on something?
132	82 116 135 117 121 193 199 126 194 107 132	What kind of animal is this? Kill it with fire
132	86 54 136 135 148 28 70 30 202 186 132	I'd like to go 4 wheeling through this field on a muddy day.

132	104 29 134 25 6 83 28 172 190 203 132	Those little trees won't be standing much longer.
132	138 65 60 188 202 27 41 8 23 114 132	This guy is killing himself by smoking!
132	54 185 43 209 176 76 145 51 131 98 132	I will crush those leaves

132	169 151 211 119 4 204 33 11 207 171 132	This place needs to be wiped.
132	102 49 45 118 43 122 170 184 158 139 132	The fern ruined the landscape of the otherwise pristine forest.
132	99 27 53 149 117 129 136 7 82 173 132	I'm ready to see this elephant knock down that fence!
132	195 91 149 161 61 109 72 191 97 173 132	Its beautiful, shame that global warming will ruin it.
132	73 134 142 9 13 180 158 154 1 16 132	The idol is useless to the community and needs to be removed.
132	195 166 36 60 80 194 136 84 18 159 132	That bird totally destroyed that fish!
132	105 121 80 75 15 163 129 178 44 143 132	This band looks about as engaing as the town business partnership ad seen in the background.
132	113 3 148 48 183 212 34 167 71 28 132	A rock wall is shown
132	127 49 205 145 190 30 68 32 176 187 132	let's knock them all down like bowling pis
132	46 170 104 14 90 94 188 191 179 211 132	A cat could destroy that.
132	103 4 33 21 149 160 198 209 84 17 132	This is just sitting in the middle of nowhere!  Knock it down!  It's useless!
132	25 89 106 62 138 29 78 56 156 164 132	Only man can make nature look so defeated.
132	209 21 82 105 97 22 172 159 89 201 132	CRUSH HIM! GO STANFORD GO STANFORD GO! #treesforever

132	34 62 190 82 133 167 182 18 127 176 132	Peace? Would she still feel peace when I knocked her drink over?
132	103 102 202 42 81 129 78 121 114 203 132	Crush those buildings! Put up a new mall, I hate those houses!
132	131 6 53 117 55 100 29 19 193 138 132	PEOPLE THAT DO NOT ACCEPT THE SIGN WERE DESTRUCTIVE TO IT.

134	113 24 73 8 176 210 159 124 123 47 134	She must be getting that cup of juice because she is thirsty.
134	40 20 196 151 50 83 179 136 184 156 134	I love the designs and random swirl pattern in the picture and the beautiful rare neon yellow and gold color to it.
134	64 44 66 72 15 75 182 89 115 48 134	Beautiful flower and sight
134	119 44 186 104 101 33 98 210 156 84 134	there are 5 chairs
134	35 94 148 15 39 17 120 183 138 81 134	These would be perfect with a white sundress and a walk on the beach!
134	155 192 137 39 11 196 63 199 92 158 134	She can see more than you know.
134	100 192 48 61 11 170 135 156 127 68 134	Their is footstep on the soil
134	140 40 137 157 38 48 147 112 4 102 134	I see two people
134	112 141 35 105 36 191 28 189 39 184 134	I see that you were trying to make a face out of all of that junk.
134	94 124 199 156 11 206 39 204 111 26 134	The use of green denotes the artist's view of greed.
134	90 48 104 84 51 74 57 34 35 29 134	I love the water depth of this lake! So beautiful and clear.
134	97 12 205 207 40 69 66 79 50 170 134	It looks like it's just starting, but i would suggest getting along with the progress.
134	100 89 131 5 79 90 189 87 203 58 134	It seems as if the yellow car will win but the red and blue car looks faster.
134	74 83 96 87 90 99 100 198 102 110 134	Is that part of the Chicago skyline behind them?
134	180 24 212 184 175 41 186 124 197 67 134	It looks like the sun it setting, The tide is low.
134	27 29 133 81 20 103 189 125 122 80 134	Did you know this museum holds the declaration of independence?
134	17 46 180 39 152 34 139 51 165 129 134	I can see they have their whole street food operation set up from the back of their truck.
134	83 174 119 73 160 177 94 91 20 203 134	She is blushing
134	161 111 80 63 197 208 11 132 155 1 134	the riders on the bike are perceptive
134	205 183 23 203 24 93 8 164 171 89 134	She keeps her eyes on the cameraman as he works.
134	133 13 155 97 200 176 16 179 72 140 134	Being in this moment is what you have to experience.
134	44 67 22 29 148 176 145 17 118 122 134	leaning tower of piza
134	20 114 63 46 209 33 49 190 30 16 134	It looks like it might rain
134	186 196 167 60 183 143 150 39 50 44 134	there are six people in the photo
134	185 16 91 89 3 136 79 67 120 155 134	You can just see the attention that this man puts in his cooking. Nothing like dedication and love in a dish.
134	145 93 71 90 188 127 110 22 26 28 134	It is the way you view the city that make you either love or hate it
134	78 176 160 187 113 61 31 6 152 21 134	There are mountains back there
134	32 42 31 129 55 51 130 157 117 103 134	This look like a nice place to have a picnic and just relax and talk about life.
134	54 151 193 42 181 46 71 188 28 125 134	The view allows me to put my relationship with the big city into balance and relief.
134	17 37 89 168 45 105 125 175 189 81 134	These boys have done something wrong, you can see it in their smiles.
134	51 46 33 68 25 104 83 185 106 186 134	It looks like they're studying for a test.
134	215 186 138 106 6 5 170 97 8 111 134	I believe that is a cashmere sweater he is wearing.
134	44 90 110 139 140 67 70 50 83 56 134	Wow! What an amazing shot!
134	111 156 16 152 155 186 23 94 18 37 134	Hmmm... I wonder if this player did something wrong?
134	77 189 138 182 48 184 140 169 3 54 134	I am not sure my point of view on the street.
134	112 87 16 131 121 82 145 80 19 41 134	I can see everyone to the side of the stage
134	189 51 96 43 210 125 58 188 11 42 134	It is the greatest thing, to be hold the beauty of nature.  From some place warm.
134	119 84 70 160 205 24 47 178 49 186 134	What a sad fair it's like it knowns that it's time has come to an end.
134	144 15 178 175 5 173 73 202 17 165 134	The red really stands out on that building.
134	68 178 101 3 109 78 92 203 210 26 134	This band is likely more than just the two members
134	30 198 171 101 177 117 151 168 42 52 134	Is it just me, or does that temple in the distance look slanted?
134	201 26 5 137 211 55 117 163 175 21 134	Interesting that these two signs are so close together.
134	198 135 156 142 202 152 36 12 127 27 134	I like how Lego gave the male figure white gloves.
134	151 61 33 67 182 62 65 70 146 98 134	Everyone in this picture looks hot!
134	140 34 62 53 26 188 92 21 116 210 134	Got to hope for the best lie
134	9 177 156 8 210 151 77 62 60 71 134	There seems to be 2 sets of footprints.
134	92 25 36 184 174 157 213 85 21 203 134	I love the forest, it helps me clear my head and see things more clearly.
134	93 49 19 112 54 181 97 96 166 115 134	Must've taken a very long time to build this
134	73 21 122 30 94 180 121 37 188 29 134	as the ice chairs got warmer they started melting and some of the guests were stuck
134	144 157 158 104 99 111 32 18 11 122 134	They are so happy together.
134	194 118 99 129 106 90 15 190 101 78 134	We could do well enough
134	22 167 68 82 206 45 28 110 29 85 134	Their face painting is very well done.
134	133 215 173 64 116 12 193 39 85 168 134	This is an old building.
134	77 97 93 30 184 143 91 200 59 85 134	She looks like someone made her happy.
134	47 105 96 68 95 5 165 99 143 29 134	That is a lot of hot sauces!
134	136 120 6 138 200 179 152 74 110 4 134	What a beautiful and insightful picture
134	78 9 117 23 162 109 170 6 105 149 134	I wonder how much those fruits cost.
135	37 22 61 202 173 29 118 181 70 129 135	Guitars make me so mad!
135	168 86 69 193 59 27 21 5 151 78 135	Yes! Let these brave men destroy those who would take away our freedom!
135	70 196 90 103 163 87 16 117 201 151 135	I'm going to fall over to that rock and break it.
135	47 80 26 7 84 30 120 193 79 147 135	Stop playing around you too!
135	33 38 19 63 129 55 180 66 60 146 135	Yelling to the tv
135	60 88 182 129 170 55 62 44 184 171 135	The campus center show be open 24/7
135	169 46 51 22 191 92 149 81 54 215 135	This couple should not be hugging in public.
135	14 119 159 175 210 115 90 49 12 38 135	Pick that chair up right now!
135	1 76 79 104 157 19 173 155 120 124 135	Crush those cowards now!
135	8 57 2 214 51 131 77 206 80 188 135	I just want to take that scarf and wrap it around the both of them! Tie it in a knot to keep them together forever!
135	119 100 90 34 71 74 186 207 188 124 135	I'm going to pry that hook off and gouge your eyes out with it, you little punk
135	166 13 148 110 73 118 140 18 99 176 135	Hopefully they are not at max capacity, and fall to their deaths.
135	51 161 72 131 91 30 41 175 42 188 135	Why is the weather always like this?
135	51 64 118 32 192 162 120 147 96 138 135	Worst picture ever, what were you thinking dude?
135	189 210 211 125 5 116 92 80 183 215 135	I like this picture it have such a artsy mechanical touch.
135	115 58 146 51 178 200 197 18 25 148 135	He, and I would tear this place up!
135	149 86 184 17 99 148 25 34 82 121 135	She thinks she can control me
135	168 177 81 126 215 145 165 25 32 193 135	hope she has bug spray
135	89 85 154 49 168 161 113 214 33 190 135	An emblem of strength and power!
135	54 211 155 157 103 183 130 170 209 17 135	I just want to yank that stupid flower off its stem.
135	36 183 167 141 182 92 136 54 85 148 135	It was aggressively beautiful that day
135	25 104 215 202 52 214 211 50 143 177 135	I'm sure I could play guitar at a festival too.
135	40 202 192 167 124 94 198 85 53 82 135	I would be furious of my son let the grass and weeds get that tall
135	7 21 56 50 199 134 183 76 170 51 135	Why exactly are we feeding the birds? Can't they find their own food, that's what they're supposed to do.
135	62 159 127 82 207 189 72 163 88 158 135	I think I'll bust up this party.
135	130 192 173 58 134 161 175 22 155 8 135	Look at all these drunkards at this party, I can not stand people who drink that much wine.
135	171 201 196 153 20 202 64 161 41 31 135	Those shorts do not look right on her!
135	70 152 173 145 36 115 105 148 113 189 135	I want to attack this street with my cleaning machine.
135	180 68 212 160 119 44 36 53 110 175 135	I wanto to light those things on fire so they'll get that stupid looking thing out of here.
135	122 168 137 101 2 119 211 184 7 149 135	Why would you take such a distorted picture of umbrellas!
135	123 173 5 206 155 137 13 12 181 203 135	So many white people, why no diversity?
135	99 182 28 98 173 110 200 62 87 106 135	Ugh!  How many pics like this need to be posted?  Did you really have to be the millionth?!
135	36 130 55 8 69 40 5 117 154 158 135	why would you feed your baby dairy products clearly he doesn't like it
135	51 27 81 50 63 98 143 163 85 108 135	I'm going to tear off those stickers and put my own stickers in their place.
135	114 192 88 130 201 115 143 142 133 63 135	I bet they are discussing about pointless stuff. I HATE these people!
135	100 190 198 161 138 24 30 204 169 1 135	Just one step at a time. You can do it
135	54 84 146 183 125 25 26 126 203 131 135	She looks pretty snobby to me, I bet she's a horrible person.
135	25 26 176 204 64 141 132 90 189 214 135	Strike out again, I'm going to start yelling at the ump!
135	59 137 11 177 95 64 168 196 124 12 135	This squirrel looks like a fun challenge to try and hunt down
135	157 212 66 196 111 25 192 145 8 164 135	Ughhhh why is that guy shirtless I want to punch him.
135	42 94 215 6 203 53 139 31 107 22 135	I can stay infront of them
135	159 73 193 215 13 140 44 101 19 205 135	I love how the two women seem to hold a true friendship.
135	123 211 151 149 163 112 147 201 69 180 135	I'd go swimming here, I don't care if it's dangerous.
135	184 58 76 18 121 196 27 39 25 193 135	It started as a peaceful protest.
135	186 55 153 143 38 211 73 209 30 130 135	I know I could take him in a fight!
135	100 211 168 181 92 107 146 84 45 5 135	If I were her, I'd punch him in the face
135	18 91 10 115 182 72 42 111 110 174 135	When we hit the shore, I want a hard target search of every boat house, out house and hen house in a three mile radius.
135	145 115 34 16 80 11 42 158 179 57 135	The mountains can seem aggressive.
135	181 164 35 18 196 14 28 197 206 113 135	They are about to get beat by my kids soccer squad
135	211 106 163 36 187 104 79 151 141 70 135	These girls look like they're trying to hurt me! I think I need to attack them first!
135	18 195 152 154 208 188 211 74 110 65 135	That building is breaking the rules
135	107 41 104 77 66 29 81 188 185 157 135	I wish everyone would stay home. There's too much traffic.
135	61 208 68 194 183 27 177 132 47 163 135	I hate him.
135	212 64 48 187 146 191 59 40 92 67 135	Whoever that is they better watch out!
135	164 211 63 177 50 184 136 41 123 149 135	It would be so cool to break all the windows out in that place.
135	140 73 126 111 174 164 80 71 141 130 135	It'd be funny to push someone down on those hard bricks.
135	7 137 149 204 102 113 188 111 29 92 135	Those leaves look like they have sharp edges.
135	131 99 169 37 177 192 138 151 41 202 135	this place is too calm for me. I want to go climb that rock!
135	77 15 94 168 171 131 122 169 213 80 135	These tourists look like idiots
135	206 203 195 142 111 124 34 21 82 9 135	That girl is really attractive
135	71 209 179 79 82 23 106 143 61 157 135	what a filthy office!
135	142 128 151 200 193 126 63 201 1 202 135	I would laugh if he fell into the water.
135	81 113 209 144 32 146 171 190 47 90 135	ANyone who would go anywhere like this boring place must be one sandwich short of a picnic.
135	122 151 168 189 106 22 134 97 201 176 135	That guys musatche should be cut off immediately, so gross.
135	109 125 138 160 144 61 202 120 133 102 135	I would really demand somebody to repair every damage done to this.
135	79 119 105 131 128 200 99 210 63 17 135	These seats are terrible, they should've demanded better seats.
135	28 81 210 47 200 183 190 192 92 17 135	Looks like a bunch of meat will be wasted.
135	2 95 60 58 15 136 32 56 131 3 135	The cold, hard images below suggest that the town is unwelcoming and confrontational.
135	101 66 131 43 195 203 178 213 120 84 135	pull her down
135	57 138 215 74 132 10 139 126 185 154 135	I hate this color with a passion.  NO!
135	51 44 14 148 45 211 43 52 213 178 135	i just want to cut all those trees down
135	215 16 112 27 67 166 88 26 87 103 135	She looks like she doesn't know what she is talking about.
135	23 18 162 43 182 203 152 67 75 25 135	How overpowerin of those weeds
135	133 171 134 51 101 190 147 151 191 104 135	Look at the background of this picture. It seems like someone aint having no happy birthday. Take that crap down.
135	105 4 19 1 61 9 107 188 89 88 135	Id do a better paving job then who ever did this rubbish!
135	21 169 67 165 17 101 134 71 123 161 135	The flowers grow everywhere as if nothing can stop them.
135	54 45 212 170 42 90 108 53 25 200 135	If these police tried to arrest me on the subway you bet I would fight back man! They need to stay in their cars not ride the subway.
135	161 119 28 58 137 60 154 18 36 101 135	I wanna chase the squirrel.
135	57 16 202 168 119 127 175 186 138 72 135	Why is there nobody there there is always a crowd there
135	102 147 196 188 180 103 159 148 125 3 135	This stupid building just won't go back together!
135	44 86 80 58 193 171 18 140 208 145 135	This guy probably thinks he looks tough wearing a shirt like that to show off his muscles but they aren't impressive.
135	137 90 89 88 72 169 86 183 172 140 135	These people need to get out of the road or someone will want to hit them!
135	98 167 99 36 113 43 198 2 55 148 135	She would lose the surfing competition because she lacks guts.
135	48 5 78 188 86 14 57 191 132 161 135	That woman in the freaky costume is making me so angry. I want to punch her.
135	136 130 104 109 88 188 33 168 25 100 135	I bet that trolley is going faster than the speed limit. What is the conductor thinking!
135	61 198 208 203 86 128 56 80 127 116 135	We need bigger planes!!
135	192 137 33 175 107 62 145 201 12 108 135	It looks like a laser sword
135	61 23 57 10 21 177 157 9 156 184 135	I really don't like the look of that city.
135	86 172 9 162 100 4 36 90 206 192 135	You call that cooking? It doesn't look appetizing at all!
135	147 11 28 49 13 31 122 25 128 163 135	Stop pushing me near this railing. I could fall off.
135	19 152 107 159 64 52 133 36 181 4 135	I don't know what the heck this even is!
135	166 164 211 14 139 200 69 207 85 113 135	Tear down those posters, they're ugly.
135	89 69 121 32 17 206 117 166 20 46 135	I can bit the drum better
135	209 174 14 146 162 28 76 26 2 142 135	If I had to wait in a line as long as this one, I would go postal!
135	159 174 86 68 30 138 90 35 82 193 135	She looks so angry with her job
136	211 52 214 204 192 15 12 174 153 100 136	My goodness, now it is time to scrub in the bath tub!
136	39 182 210 117 120 11 176 126 193 163 136	This guy must be giving this to his mother for mothers day.
136	135 175 55 193 172 143 91 23 2 44 136	He needs to brush his hair to be more presentable
136	28 144 50 127 185 20 192 66 5 99 136	I wish I could get him to get a haircut!
136	145 150 130 1 92 172 152 70 59 38 136	This is no place for kids, they could fall and hurt themselves.
136	196 179 182 114 71 190 68 56 143 177 136	This would be a great place to raise a family.
136	87 72 120 179 125 89 205 196 156 42 136	They should be careful around that bird. It might be diseased.
136	189 168 190 145 184 210 120 126 198 143 136	always trying to stay positive and safe.
136	198 89 128 162 6 204 167 178 157 117 136	How's everyone doing tonight? Are we all dressed for the weather?
136	82 109 47 6 173 207 107 174 158 151 136	This water reminds me of when I gave birth to my first child
136	213 140 91 31 145 160 77 61 190 84 136	Is long term exposure to this color bad for my eyes?
136	197 74 215 90 189 121 204 180 97 129 136	For the last time Tom, I told you to clean your room!
136	151 23 159 58 147 183 4 150 89 33 136	Good nursery color. Love it
136	45 144 71 67 19 81 68 191 160 162 136	Be careful young man! You should wear a hat when the sun is out, heatstroke is a real problem in the summer!
136	153 90 1 162 189 198 6 178 197 139 136	A lovely group :)
136	101 147 155 157 84 203 94 156 143 2 136	Now everyone needs to be careful crossing the street here.
136	132 103 193 170 6 173 201 165 128 50 136	They better be safe in those cars!
136	135 188 184 23 53 83 9 59 51 103 136	What a sweet road. It takes people safely where they want to go.
136	103 26 27 126 205 98 22 108 210 161 136	We should bring them some water.
136	2 158 213 144 149 10 134 153 101 157 136	What a lovely man! I bet he works very hard, poor thing.
136	147 180 29 127 161 126 68 97 202 24 136	Just looking at this image makes me nervous! Gotta hold onto my kids
136	67 73 192 37 137 87 165 55 54 180 136	Be careful driving through there
136	112 4 183 151 38 180 18 138 143 154 136	I hope no children get hurt crossing here, they need a sign.
136	88 111 169 193 189 127 53 211 28 41 136	Whenever I reach home mom will be at the stairs.
136	169 1 197 128 38 102 79 215 181 212 136	That bicycle is just fine
136	146 26 209 86 39 193 180 38 152 95 136	Be careful! Those cacti look sharp!
136	22 63 196 151 1 106 164 108 177 47 136	I just want to give that alligator a hug!
136	72 81 130 123 110 30 165 150 35 68 136	I hope this player's safety equipment is well maintained, hockey can be so dangerous sometimes.
136	131 202 112 81 151 132 84 33 155 64 136	I sure hope she wins!
136	45 72 139 57 169 150 154 118 195 123 136	Wanting to feed all the ice cream to my child
136	35 68 205 86 105 175 199 27 98 196 136	I lost a baby, too. The worse thing that ever happened to me was my empty aching arms.
136	199 20 118 28 116 202 215 6 16 154 136	He should be careful with that Frisbee. The woods aren't clear enough.
136	88 40 75 23 155 58 4 153 97 39 136	What sweet kids. I bet they've worked really hard at this project.
136	24 55 149 72 43 100 15 110 125 40 136	Please take your hat off before entering a church as a sign of respect.
136	125 120 118 90 7 39 10 174 173 70 136	My mother would love this.
136	173 79 80 107 94 148 95 15 73 27 136	Don't forget to wear your helmet!
136	29 122 199 100 62 212 75 165 201 77 136	That lady dresses and looks like my mom from behind.
136	58 210 144 94 109 91 64 78 79 119 136	This is just what you need to be happy and healthy!
136	80 5 81 62 48 31 200 137 128 101 136	This color reminds me of my son.
136	7 208 71 40 179 32 53 81 11 170 136	oh be careful!
136	204 93 62 41 188 174 28 149 23 83 136	Awww, look at these boys learning how to save lives!
136	193 52 67 208 53 100 190 72 143 95 136	they look like a good presents for children
136	166 29 157 14 124 100 133 86 59 13 136	I could be her mother.
136	214 108 167 163 95 206 85 162 208 71 136	A beautiful flower needs a good green thumb to keep it thriving.
136	108 6 66 88 214 205 146 143 65 153 136	the craftsmanship of Mother Nature shows great care and nurturing in this sculpted Butte
136	116 23 81 40 124 172 9 191 196 52 136	Those toys look so sad sitting on that shelf by themselves. I would love to pick them all up and hug them.
136	87 51 199 111 166 33 19 158 183 121 136	I am glad to see the girls getting along.
136	189 131 172 82 158 206 77 199 171 49 136	She's doing such a fine job swimming.
136	184 97 27 208 116 194 61 25 43 148 136	I love the simplicity of this; it touches my heart.
136	200 141 124 94 42 10 167 180 168 85 136	This is a good home
136	38 123 154 56 196 156 50 8 179 192 136	That looks like a fun place, but the young people really need to be careful what they get themselves into.
136	111 23 37 8 152 103 187 76 138 174 136	We must take car of the Earth like she is our child.
136	201 60 141 161 148 54 56 15 62 43 136	Proud of the happiest moments, stay responsible anyways.
136	72 20 83 166 193 178 206 198 134 49 136	Such a lovely project! I'd be so proud to see my kids learn this.
136	153 6 13 19 20 44 79 105 83 126 136	They look like great kids, they can do it! I believe in their sweet faces <3
136	40 39 181 51 101 55 94 86 183 15 136	Make sure it has the zoom feature!
136	2 80 17 113 38 62 166 41 74 149 136	It looks like he is nervous, I hope he does ok!
136	2 93 189 90 84 57 142 165 21 56 136	You're all grown up!
136	126 167 202 142 68 189 65 102 10 18 136	THE LITTLE GIRL HAS FEATURES LIKE HER MOTHER.
136	75 121 66 51 25 179 144 203 181 97 136	I would be worried about getting cold out there.
136	40 198 46 175 103 195 205 35 106 201 136	Don't get too close to the wire you may cut yourself!
136	28 193 98 166 44 172 179 89 143 19 136	It is not safe to be out in this weather.
136	74 175 148 138 87 193 112 8 75 110 136	Mother raised the best
136	130 187 213 64 110 198 168 19 163 41 136	This is far too dangerous for anyone. Though beautiful too dangerous for my babies to play in nature like this!
136	211 156 184 66 189 63 52 124 213 150 136	I cannot wait to be a grandmother like this woman! I will be the best.
136	166 186 175 23 17 89 26 135 63 150 136	The flowers need a drink of water!
136	29 115 2 27 135 43 87 182 126 197 136	The animals are so adorable
136	183 139 47 77 2 144 153 58 198 23 136	I don't see these girls being very motherly like me
136	66 119 43 26 138 215 45 191 105 139 136	I wouldn't want my mother to get me a cat.
136	14 147 198 3 49 155 97 94 66 204 136	I hope the flowers are well taken care of, they're so precious and delicate, I do hope someone is watering them every day.
136	84 196 165 177 193 138 72 80 125 186 136	If you don't stay within the lines of the road, you may hurt yourself!
136	163 200 93 101 214 194 172 19 210 61 136	The steel protects whats inside the drum container
136	53 117 13 8 54 39 202 20 34 75 136	That's a dragon fly. Stay away or it may bite you.
136	59 184 122 178 203 123 198 130 29 156 136	This looks like a place I'd like to take my family.
136	85 45 169 121 161 60 204 52 103 101 136	Oh no, I hope everyone's okay.
136	133 157 102 86 215 91 73 206 150 114 136	This window doesn't look very safe. There could be kids inside and you wouldn't want someone to break in.
136	213 160 41 212 155 4 121 148 50 73 136	Putting out some food for Mr. and Mrs. Birdy.
136	173 156 165 84 71 42 132 10 80 151 136	This color reminds me of my daughters eyes, so beautiful.
136	74 175 155 197 213 191 183 17 78 101 136	These young ladies are so beautiful, I just want to reach out and give them a hug.
136	47 214 101 150 154 29 183 151 6 103 136	I hope they drive safely.
136	110 73 61 147 153 144 212 194 67 150 136	mother soul is a real god
136	5 115 100 60 141 156 82 155 125 159 136	Don't walk across the street like that!
136	65 27 188 116 35 101 4 54 79 206 136	I'd love to take my child here.
136	132 215 5 64 75 180 69 58 167 87 136	It may be a face only a mother could love, but I think it's adorable!
136	114 74 10 192 52 50 34 56 185 16 136	His mother probably packed that bag.
136	144 164 127 86 52 184 209 166 208 180 136	My wife loves me like she is my mother.
136	58 71 49 177 161 176 108 114 164 192 136	Grandmothers wedding ring
136	164 12 23 108 89 158 61 7 183 148 136	Oh my daughter would love that.
136	164 182 113 181 55 149 205 33 96 125 136	They look so cute. I hope they are behaving themselves.
136	198 89 138 161 124 51 82 202 75 19 136	Art is fun but look at how messy you'd get your hands doing that.
136	164 185 9 171 25 23 38 197 76 156 136	Green like this, should always be covered up.  You don't want to hurt your eyes staring at it!
136	153 91 187 174 23 74 127 71 97 101 136	Look at that beautiful family of trees.
136	137 174 2 132 186 45 201 181 27 55 136	Mother nature guides us.
137	68 56 9 85 90 74 150 194 154 15 137	I hope they're learning a lot.
137	103 41 210 182 140 135 42 32 37 18 137	Is this in New York City?
137	108 8 20 42 169 78 161 13 197 63 137	What a cool hat!
137	155 169 18 119 135 121 80 146 26 152 137	I want to ride that bike.
137	1 93 134 211 69 61 161 148 26 130 137	What a nice looking family.
137	55 187 12 32 184 150 215 214 199 80 137	That girl plays too much...she's a rose with too many thorns, I would be chill and steer clear...
137	32 163 50 15 134 95 208 17 16 201 137	I love dancing.
137	168 26 125 19 31 110 3 44 87 77 137	Presentation is kind of boring
137	9 111 215 120 136 196 59 121 128 109 137	Thats a cool font
137	160 107 147 65 80 73 15 94 17 124 137	Looks real yummy!
137	99 48 123 172 182 8 40 175 83 111 137	That looks so nice to be in right now.
137	83 97 55 87 98 40 204 36 167 15 137	I would pay to watch a show like this.
137	139 210 104 92 49 21 109 151 26 212 137	Nice field. What's on the other side of this wall?
137	63 93 78 17 43 74 144 109 66 37 137	What a soothing piece of work right here.
137	22 136 75 198 111 122 138 140 44 53 137	This guy looks like he's at a fun party!
137	21 177 103 73 58 48 79 118 151 94 137	This place would make a cool place to hang out.
137	56 121 141 171 38 183 36 91 46 174 137	Martial arts are so chill
137	177 12 38 75 1 40 202 50 49 140 137	What a nice day for a ride.
137	127 174 124 160 207 101 146 112 105 163 137	they need cleaning
137	66 16 40 79 118 179 174 109 84 58 137	I am at peace in this location.
137	183 160 15 105 170 26 166 155 96 140 137	What a nice view, makes me feel calm.
137	148 8 42 144 66 3 11 23 111 197 137	That's a really warm looking brown, like a nice milk chocolate.
137	23 77 74 117 86 64 157 27 32 145 137	Yeah I could press any of these buttons and be fine with it
137	171 161 151 126 162 147 142 37 195 129 137	My grandparents had things like this, they're rad
137	44 152 168 170 197 28 171 35 212 37 137	Everyone loves a cool music festival
137	207 166 186 138 83 116 145 105 5 17 137	The dog looks so calm and peaceful
137	66 38 127 100 35 121 63 134 101 131 137	El Cheapo? That's not going to get you any good beer!
137	50 120 167 127 179 73 75 11 198 77 137	such a nice day
137	138 164 142 108 5 162 215 171 48 195 137	having fun, relaxing and enjoying
137	185 149 128 72 141 108 180 71 49 151 137	The boy seems timid
137	199 106 72 66 188 51 30 1 191 103 137	The couple just met and agreed to have coffee.
137	145 211 164 203 150 165 207 2 35 177 137	yeah... now she can reach

138	29 18 185 51 37 154 175 28 108 153 138	I remember my old home in new jersey, i miss the good old days with my pop.
138	75 122 95 41 184 201 205 173 24 147 138	She caress so much about her
138	215 187 116 199 90 209 25 47 5 16 138	A lovely small family reunion.
138	59 183 79 46 35 126 77 123 9 82 138	This mountain and the glare of a dashboard remind me of childhood when we'd go up to the mountains to play in the snow.
138	84 129 3 208 38 161 8 128 186 178 138	I visited this church on my honeymoon. It was so splendid.
138	71 141 153 162 14 155 149 214 197 198 138	The last time someone did this was when I went to the event with Martha, my best friend.
138	81 26 160 157 47 38 57 109 12 80 138	My most fond memories of my mom are going to the opera.
138	2 146 56 147 35 128 62 187 206 205 138	we took the stage again , just like in the good old days .

138	103 166 196 16 96 145 4 101 44 86 138	I REMEMBER WHEN I WENT TO COLLEGE HERE AND MET THE LOVE OF MY LIFE
138	187 90 86 193 198 3 6 94 82 136 138	A little sentiment for Steve Irwin.
138	100 196 170 82 74 108 206 45 171 152 138	Ah, the desert landscape reminds of of my days as a kid when we would run around for hours and play. Those were the days.
138	185 87 150 88 6 169 179 159 211 23 138	Reminds me scifi shows from the 80s.... Really brings me back. nostalgic.
138	97 199 172 149 137 75 13 80 83 51 138	What a prized memory!
139	6 205 65 200 107 55 122 149 83 96 139	I cant believe they've forgotten their lines again!
139	127 119 81 116 194 148 156 90 64 108 139	It is just a cat, nothing special about it.
139	20 103 160 140 168 134 36 211 54 80 139	Is that a kid? This picture is dark.
139	128 133 203 1 12 64 207 4 140 164 139	Is this written in a language?
139	100 8 76 102 154 185 62 26 129 167 139	She looks cold.
139	148 7 98 86 170 96 185 156 80 78 139	I don't have a clue what is going on.
139	1 135 95 177 110 193 153 25 128 96 139	Is that a stick on a rock?
139	104 189 68 200 201 145 49 57 185 9 139	Just a plain green background.
139	43 115 214 66 88 191 152 109 52 96 139	Wow...the lights are so red.
139	73 88 125 83 57 21 151 169 35 6 139	Oy, oy, oy, oy, get them and bugger off!
139	155 85 92 20 1 117 19 14 95 66 139	I just do not feel I belong in the big city.
139	90 151 24 48 28 167 5 182 62 49 139	I don't know why people would want to buy those peace sign decorations.
139	30 176 159 128 146 99 42 86 59 203 139	That looks like a rose right?
139	167 5 30 151 4 123 163 171 161 182 139	Red flowers are like so pretty and you know good.
139	31 98 198 213 43 54 60 197 81 82 139	This looks like it's trying to steal my info.
139	50 127 136 40 199 87 164 144 138 206 139	Just a bunch of scribbles if you ask me.
139	116 128 40 104 203 160 127 87 146 88 139	The children here must be bored out of the minds, playing with such rubbish!
139	41 188 168 172 125 119 58 67 115 211 139	Why are the flowers purple
139	168 155 21 121 152 64 108 131 27 174 139	there is an unlimited supply of water in the fountain
139	163 109 162 1 180 10 116 20 22 81 139	I don't know what is going on here but I think this guy might be on TV.
139	121 141 71 154 206 182 38 79 119 50 139	That is a dog.
139	126 52 8 200 170 15 20 37 212 81 139	The colours are nice here - where is it?
139	137 88 194 97 99 38 131 201 41 5 139	I think those are French things.
139	3 56 199 19 169 2 104 91 188 30 139	is this an ocean
139	38 134 192 95 133 70 53 136 212 90 139	I can't see a thing in this photo, why is it special?
139	75 118 71 81 183 146 111 202 172 207 139	It looks like a forest.
139	28 25 135 153 167 51 165 118 141 147 139	Which way is the ceiling
139	70 181 191 151 12 120 121 137 127 149 139	That girl doesn't look very smart
139	74 5 164 142 2 110 145 158 34 161 139	This is not my type of environment. I like a more brain stimulating activity.
139	151 46 199 209 106 80 33 184 81 103 139	When I was a kid, we didn't have to wear all that stuff for roller skating parties.  How annoying!
139	135 94 60 164 110 187 111 202 52 62 139	Wow. Those people look, like, so bored. Why aren't they doing anything?
139	70 21 159 29 132 123 79 32 200 107 139	That's pretty cute.
139	84 163 56 148 197 146 34 168 154 106 139	THIS FARMHOUSE HAS BUILT MANY HOMES.
139	31 127 156 36 70 177 171 199 43 7 139	I can't understand
139	97 123 71 5 163 175 21 86 18 94 139	This looks boring.
139	81 111 189 7 167 110 37 201 143 192 139	Who was dumb enough to not put a light hanging above me in this dark pathway?
139	59 196 158 146 166 19 173 126 197 86 139	The person looks like an author!
139	76 49 186 178 120 195 20 106 67 25 139	What is that brown thing she's staring at?
139	32 202 173 76 46 104 121 155 191 180 139	umm yeah blah
139	73 118 141 171 124 132 82 152 83 106 139	Thought this was a telephone. Where's the numbers?
139	57 48 147 149 118 52 37 106 50 73 139	Was this at night or in the morning?
139	45 109 61 110 154 165 31 130 28 19 139	How do cars fit on this road?
139	108 129 82 173 198 74 26 214 46 24 139	Water is great, it's useful for human kind. Water has a lot of benefits.
139	70 206 24 200 10 131 135 48 151 156 139	Is the water deep?
139	84 119 151 115 50 64 208 71 179 45 139	What is on the car?
139	136 198 118 152 43 39 60 1 22 19 139	why isnt she lookin at the camera
139	98 173 85 125 109 27 103 122 8 97 139	Hey I see lots of rocks. I wonder how fast those rocks move.
139	126 176 199 117 93 180 154 25 184 200 139	Water The On Reflection The At Look
139	202 106 100 152 161 66 206 211 42 170 139	Awe, what a cute baby!
139	135 79 199 211 57 180 24 29 206 65 139	Baggy pants are funny
139	138 177 210 110 125 121 131 203 17 202 139	A dull ride.
139	59 111 113 54 189 185 4 160 164 77 139	Not much to see or learn from this woodcut
139	110 119 185 65 54 201 146 37 200 82 139	Lots of people are around me.
139	103 7 24 171 163 80 117 66 193 105 139	Logo t shirts are a dumb thing to wear.
139	101 180 58 46 197 171 137 98 188 136 139	such a weird plant
139	43 63 3 165 39 24 212 81 64 86 139	This is an old man.
139	59 39 207 140 65 204 109 38 31 108 139	Why are these guys bothering with so much safety equipment, dumb!
139	183 163 124 195 191 66 26 15 142 186 139	the world is so empty
139	168 55 157 3 61 36 135 9 194 31 139	What function am I attending?
139	5 99 166 85 183 37 63 48 66 215 139	Gotta wonder who made this kinda building, looks greek but americans did this style first.
139	121 74 84 4 3 124 171 181 141 1 139	I wish all women were like this.
139	27 200 53 83 168 154 201 182 211 135 139	I can't figure out what this is a picture of!
139	26 1 172 150 98 61 101 160 73 134 139	thats not how you play that
139	128 58 82 154 76 130 191 92 208 141 139	Where the road starts in the foreground of the image is as empty as can be of traffic.
139	158 82 57 102 160 31 22 204 52 116 139	Wow, great photo
139	15 21 104 6 193 175 50 37 29 183 139	She looks like the everyday blond but with brunette hair.
139	36 145 12 33 108 103 93 146 85 27 139	is this photo taken in the dark or it is a curtain?
139	50 158 134 85 40 43 88 101 203 164 139	Some trees, and I think those are fields?
139	6 15 48 20 205 213 5 39 79 26 139	I love youtube, love call of duty videos
139	159 182 55 47 161 39 2 21 80 118 139	Is this a picture of the Grand Canyon?
139	215 68 142 169 191 30 144 187 80 170 139	why for is he holding that stick
139	115 110 13 186 77 12 16 134 146 140 139	If that tree falls, does any one hear it?
139	202 184 91 112 89 205 101 76 45 13 139	The picture is so empty.
139	6 75 200 70 168 180 10 56 163 57 139	That car seems like it won't last long.
139	109 176 183 50 155 126 196 184 143 58 139	What a boring, uninspiring scene. Just blah
139	94 193 185 67 26 56 7 165 131 72 139	Looks like a lot of places to trip and fall, no thanks.
139	166 89 99 8 141 9 177 107 47 154 139	How would a hat like that stay on.
139	185 8 56 48 53 74 96 15 108 102 139	This bridge is vacant and stupid
139	194 119 19 46 159 94 211 192 59 51 139	I could order a real deal here
139	70 105 151 106 169 212 138 97 131 189 139	What is going on here?
139	126 104 14 159 167 164 10 212 162 50 139	Why are those trees so small?
139	102 90 116 109 154 159 39 73 24 49 139	Lol, what's happening here??
139	143 172 202 55 76 50 27 57 96 215 139	That pin scarf mages him look dim witted.
139	194 138 125 171 38 85 173 132 75 164 139	What a bunch of neanderthals!
139	128 78 88 186 157 122 188 179 195 54 139	What am i looking at?
139	5 162 128 84 187 209 121 107 65 191 139	What is that thing on that leaf?
139	53 67 140 71 147 143 38 114 70 36 139	motorcycles are bad
139	10 14 95 35 33 129 2 107 19 164 139	a boring town
139	87 188 98 78 164 88 10 157 147 91 139	Um where are my Cheetos
139	102 194 80 75 122 181 65 11 186 63 139	These look full, but contains only empty capsules.
139	182 44 206 110 186 81 113 27 9 104 139	This man is cold!
139	132 104 90 107 49 59 146 125 148 29 139	I wonder if those dudes know each other?
139	50 165 120 99 145 133 203 166 75 40 139	very bad composition
139	80 201 98 79 183 142 186 167 170 188 139	What cooking show is this?
140	213 103 8 214 164 215 139 200 71 173 140	I'm comfortable when there aren't any people around.
140	184 115 113 10 212 165 28 193 121 37 140	I would like to sit in one of those chairs and do nothing.
140	209 174 58 67 2 78 24 157 105 213 140	I'm just going to move away from this and not tell anyone.
140	164 153 157 178 210 152 133 56 85 199 140	Looks like fun for her.
140	27 174 61 200 165 199 111 20 98 36 140	What a dull, lifeless park.
140	167 179 28 154 42 211 192 81 206 170 140	This town looks dull.
140	51 161 202 75 26 145 214 156 30 215 140	The car looks okay, but nothing special.
140	75 65 32 166 66 5 175 45 42 203 140	I am not sure
140	119 149 194 24 153 70 195 104 2 130 140	I would visit there if you want.
140	169 55 46 191 4 132 32 107 198 60 140	I hope this man figures it out.
140	92 115 10 71 2 134 109 118 23 46 140	This guy looks happy although I'm not sure why.
140	136 63 141 204 87 77 179 17 96 200 140	Those are monkeys.
140	98 190 44 109 39 151 130 91 51 172 140	A shadowy figure appears.
140	33 92 131 135 196 155 123 167 182 106 140	Fine art is quite a thing in this modern time.
140	125 204 36 108 66 80 38 84 114 134 140	It's waiting for him..
140	213 185 108 64 133 137 50 152 141 48 140	These mountains have seen 1000s of years' time
140	123 189 14 80 165 199 126 35 181 115 140	Eventually, Maude is going to have to find another place for her plants.
140	121 90 75 30 199 211 76 54 195 133 140	This is an interesting item.
140	181 123 99 35 43 171 191 179 75 132 140	Pretty cool pic.
140	29 88 163 85 91 135 147 196 180 153 140	This is a typical coffeehouse.
140	157 60 19 37 62 85 3 12 23 113 140	He is really nice man, and very easy to communicate with.
140	185 13 200 45 105 33 15 16 215 23 140	What is she looking at and why is he smiling so much?
140	194 126 210 93 207 62 212 111 63 215 140	we can't walk there, i'm not sure what to do now.
140	73 173 11 50 117 202 6 177 8 37 140	I' dig to count the cans.Someone else can straighten them up.
140	211 132 36 68 173 63 34 123 183 167 140	He was happy to just watch her climb the hill.
140	16 27 120 214 49 193 91 134 104 207 140	They look like they're having fun
140	65 142 106 49 183 66 94 18 127 55 140	Yeah, I'd let my kids do that.
140	167 72 123 43 157 152 121 23 33 182 140	So many to choose from
140	83 188 72 57 160 193 199 18 215 31 140	Whatever she wants to do, just say yes to her.
140	100 121 130 51 57 94 76 84 10 208 140	Lovely great architecture.
140	139 75 153 204 122 16 146 17 34 174 140	Milka is good chocolate, not bad not the best
140	104 45 2 168 4 68 167 194 186 191 140	can we go somewhere else now?
140	7 2 131 1 187 139 4 110 10 75 140	I'll wait till this machine is ready to weigh me.
140	60 193 36 137 154 183 163 107 45 176 140	idk if id want to be there
140	78 105 79 167 130 8 86 208 119 146 140	I’m not scared of her
140	210 141 19 100 41 75 120 11 208 71 140	I wouldn't go in there
140	82 54 43 57 83 46 157 134 176 148 140	this scenery reminds me of  when in elementary school it was very regulated and passive
140	54 92 189 198 154 71 144 101 55 200 140	Gentle green algae is growing on the rock.
140	180 77 54 19 123 115 36 185 85 23 140	I guess its okay if the man sits down by the tree.
140	199 110 154 8 6 71 24 66 26 1 140	That dog should be able to go wherever she wants.
140	160 151 120 105 200 84 45 210 1 11 140	Easy going afternoon I think.
140	207 101 23 182 210 202 94 37 133 141 140	The texture of this brick is covered by a texture sign
140	40 21 215 135 80 174 154 121 173 23 140	This is just a cloud, and another building.
140	9 205 156 22 17 83 5 202 42 177 140	I guess this was a parade.
140	119 11 41 92 164 2 121 43 32 155 140	This particular color makes me feel as if i want to do nothing
140	133 73 209 86 5 213 134 182 185 164 140	Let the girls take their time on that song.
140	54 90 24 36 134 84 48 162 18 55 140	I am keeping my hands to myself
140	146 182 208 153 196 14 91 57 136 2 140	The plant is so pliable.
140	178 70 95 194 68 120 132 172 163 203 140	i wouldnt get involved
140	124 81 93 76 158 168 199 121 191 61 140	Nice place to get wet and play in mud.
140	26 10 56 65 63 61 36 77 163 37 140	It's loud here, but there's nothing I can do about it.
140	178 156 161 207 135 100 133 65 68 106 140	Business isnt for me
140	120 201 175 134 147 34 37 185 92 154 140	I'm nervous about alleys without someone watching my back.
140	14 65 109 180 97 126 95 43 96 164 140	Those arent even healthy
140	126 41 156 121 124 152 35 164 187 13 140	I wouldn't want to walk down that road.
140	213 1 146 64 82 100 186 103 14 162 140	Nobody should pass through here
140	84 67 179 78 48 79 173 203 184 163 140	An interview in a graveyard, wow.
140	69 34 154 45 102 80 181 82 56 20 140	THESE DUDES ARE ROCKING.
140	52 112 174 209 173 104 105 29 137 68 140	decent lake picture
140	154 94 38 97 199 55 193 152 98 20 140	it was an entertaining show
140	108 42 115 119 174 10 20 157 153 134 140	Oh, look at the nice puppy. The owner must be sleeping and just let him loose on the street.
140	106 4 9 102 101 168 38 212 15 173 140	It seems like the two are having fun, strange outfits but if they're having fun, who cares.
140	179 195 9 208 157 79 40 1 86 42 140	This tree does not care if all the other trees have leaves. It will take its own time to grow.
140	145 127 21 35 126 105 96 194 159 44 140	just another normal face
140	133 25 83 144 136 96 172 163 181 176 140	green world beautyfull
140	168 86 178 23 89 76 78 207 181 201 140	What even is this?
140	5 118 63 157 162 40 145 184 165 26 140	I wanted to add more flowers but she didn't so we left it like it is.
140	186 94 29 108 75 105 3 89 97 131 140	I wasn't lucky enough to be there, but looks like fun!
140	215 153 103 176 131 84 38 122 130 118 140	I don't think I can run in a group of runners.
140	124 193 175 206 210 57 212 106 99 100 140	that looks a little scarey
140	70 88 110 134 43 119 8 192 190 68 140	I can be quite easy when it comes to my grandchildren.
140	165 131 212 127 73 61 18 157 71 104 140	There are thousands of bridges in the world, so this is nothing new, natural or not.
140	200 153 142 141 48 99 19 107 43 14 140	Would I like to play beer pong? No thanks, that seems far to social for me...
140	96 26 204 112 205 80 118 58 209 210 140	I've seen better
140	171 193 135 49 78 137 126 73 39 97 140	the mom is looking trough the whole to her girl
140	201 169 59 213 70 162 33 90 84 202 140	This is nice, I guess, what do you think?
140	11 169 16 214 178 110 195 211 106 79 140	Thats an OK church.
140	61 68 95 130 104 163 57 72 168 67 140	That's a short tunnel
140	28 135 176 195 111 110 35 84 10 30 140	scary loolking guy
140	27 188 21 94 31 208 18 180 110 56 140	The sea is so calming
140	90 64 195 117 124 50 70 65 94 103 140	I think I would listen to all the instructions this man is saying and follow them to the tee.
140	101 202 28 181 179 10 155 80 52 111 140	I have a hard time getting into basketball, it's mostly just running.
140	164 89 27 65 191 80 29 156 147 186 140	Don't worry, it's not that scary
140	25 95 1 178 10 188 105 118 104 60 140	This view is the same every time I see it.
140	128 13 56 55 122 136 77 161 160 111 140	The animal is taking a nice nap.
140	126 99 85 172 191 119 70 30 147 92 140	There seems to be an old Chinese man, that is overdressed. He must be an emperor.
140	66 33 8 42 49 190 115 169 185 209 140	Ok, well, that's just hair and a hairstyle. It's ok I guess
140	132 55 12 214 98 96 147 172 137 68 140	I guess that's a cool collection.
140	1 30 170 33 50 84 86 196 154 107 140	This is a ok river, I could go either way it is meh.
140	32 198 18 73 124 62 69 169 9 196 140	I love the motion of the statue
140	44 86 164 28 43 136 181 78 119 90 140	Just waiting for my ride. No worries. It wasn'
140	167 105 77 34 156 183 204 131 25 174 140	I showed up to hike here, but the scenery wasn't very interesting.
140	143 10 24 61 134 144 28 177 182 82 140	Hate fighting but love to watch.
140	163 147 58 79 8 138 172 104 132 110 140	I guess you can take my picture.
140	144 68 215 159 38 1 44 11 52 127 140	innocent little girl
141	168 72 9 121 162 51 5 154 189 31 141	Grid are a great way to organize this.
141	49 137 15 156 185 101 130 164 16 84 141	So what if he is going to knock out his sister with that horse on a stick. She probably deserves it.
141	196 125 178 69 48 190 68 177 57 209 141	A hole in the wall
141	212 125 72 18 113 25 59 23 95 69 141	The women may fall.
141	52 199 212 195 161 72 213 34 148 176 141	a lot of dirt here
141	19 105 213 98 12 87 97 22 1 166 141	Love the setting
141	12 132 34 9 99 138 139 130 1 82 141	some pretty nice window covers you got ther
141	138 152 59 97 184 215 41 211 198 96 141	Oh, I think this is inside a tent.
141	118 82 103 156 8 78 137 4 178 111 141	Santas beard is fake.
141	102 128 181 118 100 134 183 156 165 157 141	The ocean is best part of the universe!
141	94 28 30 140 187 151 58 86 16 72 141	There's other powerpoint templates available that could look more visually interesting.
141	7 80 119 126 35 171 127 19 195 104 141	I want a piece of that spider plant hanging in the background.  Mine died.
141	113 188 212 45 197 82 79 190 130 174 141	This building has a nice roof.
141	193 128 84 100 119 113 203 24 143 105 141	I bet she gets pretty wet in that rain
141	133 163 94 76 22 55 24 13 105 181 141	Oh that's the Coor's field. Nice place, good hot dogs.
141	55 79 92 115 139 40 69 214 82 102 141	This emblem is from my fave cafe back in North Cali
141	107 204 78 174 153 142 96 126 185 55 141	I am in awe of this beautiful view.
141	203 71 137 167 115 196 139 197 8 135 141	I wonder where the fish are.
141	123 98 100 193 212 20 57 38 161 41 141	Weird picture. I don't get it.
141	115 10 89 96 60 35 188 47 191 132 141	I wouldn't do that if I were her.
141	176 55 31 47 20 168 32 204 138 102 141	I just took this from the bar last night.  I don't know who owns it.
141	127 129 67 68 71 160 198 107 36 73 141	This car is sponsored by Chevrolet.
141	81 62 103 156 12 186 91 97 147 212 141	Nice day, eh?
141	135 150 134 158 183 42 60 180 170 193 141	Offhandrotten vegies yukh!
141	81 4 152 44 85 61 149 21 14 169 141	A small child could choke on these buttons.
141	6 173 187 166 150 130 108 84 115 41 141	Did the driver get tired or something?
141	186 60 3 30 154 59 157 209 25 169 141	I wonder whats on that tv
141	176 204 59 63 10 117 81 214 191 182 141	The storm troopers seem unconcerned
141	157 181 44 28 20 38 96 122 153 22 141	I don't understand what you're trying to convey in this picture?  The background is nothing and you look surprised or perhaps asleep.
141	111 87 74 211 132 204 23 21 142 20 141	These workers are courageous to be working in the rain. Then again, it's their job I guess.
141	106 203 215 202 135 97 181 54 56 212 141	Wonder who lives on that island
141	194 200 153 93 179 165 155 134 1 19 141	Feel indifferent looking at these chaps
141	74 2 158 198 129 1 100 210 53 58 141	when you literally can't read a single word because you're that annoying person that only knows one language.
141	16 83 175 81 2 212 187 199 51 179 141	thats a nice performance
141	213 69 129 160 184 143 152 124 13 19 141	IT'S HARD TO TELL OFFHAND WHO WILL MAKE IT AND NOT.
141	19 4 34 100 195 58 114 13 45 78 141	Why is it still snowing?
141	119 51 186 184 115 175 95 39 15 108 141	the seasoning looks very offhand.
141	16 169 99 7 57 145 136 139 198 185 141	Hmm...I need more beer.
141	36 116 122 148 111 67 65 102 46 7 141	Dude's sunglasses are really nice.
141	75 14 144 127 73 81 212 71 7 68 141	Could be better
141	200 22 78 35 153 173 105 97 121 37 141	Welp, it sure looks like a sunset to me.
141	91 61 84 78 201 117 36 10 208 66 141	I wonder who made this photo effect
141	49 131 19 81 115 196 94 28 144 13 141	These signs are lame.
141	132 197 168 10 18 208 113 144 69 52 141	There was only rice and vegetables in the dish.
141	144 21 85 152 99 137 72 115 51 179 141	I can't believe how ugly things used to be, is that for sacrificing chickens?
141	113 53 77 22 74 145 90 195 174 39 141	I don't know why she gave me this desert when she knows I don't like ice cream.
141	182 183 165 175 189 197 155 199 13 28 141	Not everyday that you get to see an octopus type creature.
141	163 175 189 40 130 193 7 179 67 88 141	These kids are playing hockey.
141	129 193 87 67 74 208 20 75 101 164 141	It's time to go to the beach.
141	89 79 189 150 197 22 18 12 11 173 141	This soap is made from goat milk and is healthier for the skin
141	163 97 155 45 135 171 93 70 140 44 141	not too shabby
141	176 32 125 211 3 138 27 175 119 151 141	This comment may be offhand, but what is happening here?
141	53 184 166 25 130 214 134 190 65 29 141	THIS CAT'S EYE ARE EVIL
141	77 215 187 133 167 94 160 212 87 35 141	Sometimes its okay to park your car on the street.
141	83 207 189 91 31 128 89 54 113 98 141	I used to have a vase of an elephant in college we kept in our kitchen
141	8 64 54 113 41 70 73 26 210 71 141	I wonder if that makeup was tested on animals.
141	164 184 10 26 167 12 109 129 162 63 141	All I see is a bunch of dirt hills.
141	192 34 104 111 122 90 110 209 205 44 141	No one cares when balloons are involved
141	144 152 185 35 59 116 148 187 65 85 141	This is for a company
141	126 87 213 177 212 150 128 161 83 78 141	We are enchanted and will be together forevere.
141	135 185 193 153 92 152 157 72 169 69 141	He should probably put his shirt on.
141	190 88 214 149 3 57 150 140 94 78 141	Looks like the World Trade Centre.
141	85 169 139 81 46 88 47 15 156 45 141	Well, there is that lake you told me about.  It's a lake for sure.
141	165 167 152 210 7 78 133 118 48 69 141	That's a pretty cool sight.
141	36 35 179 12 87 158 186 37 81 100 141	The dog looks so unconcerned
141	88 182 64 11 55 49 203 95 162 134 141	By the way, I've been here a few times.
141	53 124 29 161 164 59 146 103 83 126 141	and here we have sir sqawks!
141	166 46 111 18 128 137 134 148 145 196 141	That's a Masonic floor.  The balance of dark, and light.
141	150 157 67 173 50 33 135 109 78 177 141	Looks like the same windmill I've seen 50 times before.
141	104 205 111 151 6 154 64 213 177 170 141	Not wearing socks is probably a poor choice here.
141	208 59 4 202 163 169 99 128 35 197 141	I'm eating popcorn while looking at this.
141	105 54 213 97 90 201 168 135 188 204 141	The wall is yellow
141	77 111 144 170 194 21 123 109 49 97 141	I am sure he's good at singing for his age.
141	92 101 204 164 125 94 93 104 210 18 141	Sure, I'd buy a shirt.
141	72 110 183 63 168 98 173 103 153 76 141	A colorful performance
141	19 116 33 188 210 18 70 72 121 130 141	Oh, there's a cabin by the trees.
141	88 181 94 81 90 143 203 21 125 62 141	The beds in this hotel room are adequate.
141	94 146 47 120 60 62 86 84 193 51 141	Gross smoking is disgusting.
141	131 56 25 215 78 144 48 100 162 164 141	Huh, I wonder what that sign means.
141	146 46 30 60 114 169 21 64 188 213 141	Look at all of these tubby people
141	199 198 23 7 166 65 6 22 165 63 141	I can't think of anything
141	59 134 92 31 121 101 48 167 61 86 141	Are these shirts from pilgrim days or something?

143	154 214 119 204 184 159 171 112 15 121 143	i love this picture
143	152 11 174 44 69 90 199 55 167 101 143	I like this picture a lot. They appear to be in good spirits. I like that
143	147 201 5 97 38 55 130 209 30 19 143	They absolutely rocked the house. So glad I went.
143	19 142 177 51 128 100 163 63 39 122 143	I love this old castle
143	40 212 10 44 71 49 130 193 107 102 143	i love this place
143	122 157 6 33 25 111 147 20 10 79 143	Welcome to the fantastic show.
143	101 162 203 23 187 213 69 39 92 193 143	I'm glad this medal was given to Martin Luther King, Jr. He was more than deserving
143	50 42 17 169 166 138 7 183 77 58 143	I love seeing these guys around the garden
143	64 74 42 194 181 15 133 21 39 67 143	I would love to be in this area it's so gorgeous!
143	127 181 180 113 14 32 98 116 59 168 143	I love the time and effort artists put into their artwork. The frame is also so beautifully crafted.
143	194 85 59 159 74 26 182 104 108 38 143	Everything I have ever wanted, a beautiful mountain.
143	114 49 127 188 150 167 86 145 40 209 143	This looks like so much fun!
143	63 138 11 203 182 102 201 70 156 193 143	Wow! What an adventurer!
143	198 132 29 4 91 213 118 167 65 36 143	Awww, I bet a cat bed came in that box too!
143	104 109 94 16 199 53 24 39 163 120 143	Such fun! My kids would love it here!
143	77 177 103 73 86 207 72 19 213 122 143	I'M SO GLAD IT'S FALL.
143	170 46 154 22 159 135 65 24 15 195 143	Nothing like a horse
143	46 37 92 4 107 53 180 65 105 71 143	I wish I could photo bomb this photo because this group looks fun.
143	130 89 215 205 159 178 160 88 21 56 143	I can not wait to fly this airplane!
143	121 94 33 30 127 4 52 40 42 54 143	This rose is by itself
143	204 28 176 84 127 172 35 170 165 2 143	You can totally see the love here!
143	114 86 153 35 179 173 120 122 158 196 143	Congrats on holding the balloons, you look so proud and handsome.
143	2 114 80 46 93 120 92 158 61 7 143	This is a simple, direct message!
143	205 40 42 180 176 142 73 185 37 202 143	A wonderful day on the water
143	175 108 48 32 95 181 197 59 180 41 143	This is so nice. It just made my day
143	39 10 168 95 61 75 112 85 59 100 143	I could get used to this view everyday.
143	18 69 134 93 189 33 129 16 149 79 143	That is a cute stuffie sitting on the chair! I'm sure the child it belongs to loves it!
143	128 5 45 124 70 8 165 89 159 59 143	It would feel amazing to lay down and stare at the clouds all day.
143	53 174 119 169 135 15 110 50 138 144 143	Don;t worry the spider has left my hand
143	121 192 20 161 112 123 60 28 10 76 143	They are very enthusiastic and fullfilled
143	203 185 20 201 126 181 62 158 136 16 143	They are grateful to be togethere.
143	151 180 187 163 148 9 85 150 73 31 143	Just cool to sit in the audience and watch the Grand Old Opera . I am blessed.
143	47 157 8 57 137 23 41 146 197 133 143	I am overjoyed
143	212 215 14 156 155 96 139 151 55 135 143	This looks like a really nice time with a buffet of food.
143	198 161 96 212 119 176 94 85 70 156 143	I love this place, makes me smile
143	30 146 80 155 27 106 88 190 16 99 143	How exciting! Are they dancing? Looks like fun!
143	104 47 101 35 168 192 142 165 122 105 143	Just pass my mid terms
143	136 177 99 64 154 86 116 60 203 159 143	I love large art installations like this! I wonder where this is located?
143	163 205 97 179 24 49 171 209 27 147 143	This road looks so peaceful!
143	10 92 206 79 182 94 142 37 90 42 143	This woman looks truly intrigued to hear what the other woman has to say
143	62 179 1 59 171 138 74 55 149 177 143	The concert was so enjoyable and immensely pleasurable!
143	69 52 50 188 185 147 144 125 110 106 143	Wow this field is so beautiful! Looking at it makes me so happy :)
143	99 156 172 200 174 68 43 87 190 14 143	i would be excited to have breakfast there
143	206 96 151 182 117 207 205 150 195 202 143	What a cute kitty!
143	142 172 75 69 19 134 135 207 189 74 143	What a beatiful flower! I love spring so much.
143	68 111 129 19 173 184 136 189 178 164 143	Huge Mystery Fruit
143	100 80 150 102 98 170 18 64 68 185 143	Blue makes me want to visit the beach and eat ice cream!
143	7 117 163 43 164 118 1 66 4 10 143	Oh, I have fond memories of taking a similar image.
143	108 162 6 21 99 81 68 94 62 31 143	These windsocks are so fun! They are so joyful.
143	155 11 120 40 129 142 44 112 174 33 143	Whenever I see some band stuff it reminds me of Nick Cannon in Drumline. And he went on to marry Mariah Carey so I'm happy to see this all day!
143	192 38 48 77 94 197 135 177 47 109 143	This looks like an exciting moment.
143	67 30 192 207 18 36 147 85 189 167 143	great to be here
143	69 182 34 199 32 113 84 36 215 80 143	What a cute little fish! I would love to have him as a pet, but he is probably happier in the water!
143	201 78 76 53 206 1 54 124 91 88 143	I love this color green - it energizes me.
143	117 158 122 88 70 15 159 121 82 116 143	what a beautiful amusement park, I love the horses' wheel
143	25 42 89 170 10 190 44 13 181 63 143	Blast it out of the park!
143	73 75 146 31 32 33 199 80 50 65 143	The buzz of city lights just makes me feel energized!
144	173 177 165 33 121 175 95 58 207 62 144	I wonder who he just lost
144	177 87 58 128 210 88 21 106 4 69 144	A dilapidated backyard, the owners probably live in a bad part of town and can't afford to keep it tidy.
144	178 33 150 103 126 35 102 39 109 78 144	Time to start my mandatory course for DWI. The next 2 weeks are not going to be fun.
144	136 141 127 111 64 128 90 29 156 65 144	Oh gawd, not only does it have bald tires there is a bug swarm stuck in the grill.
144	53 175 187 29 171 79 76 114 74 95 144	I could have won, but winning is something that never happens to me.
144	110 198 192 75 105 95 184 77 136 83 144	Where is the sun?
144	184 204 141 196 39 142 29 197 71 200 144	Old tired and run down
144	200 174 31 54 129 191 122 108 51 87 144	This train looks too old to work.
144	149 212 165 80 79 15 156 105 91 85 144	This exit isn't safe.
144	164 73 170 149 27 92 96 61 97 56 144	Smoking would kill the dog
144	47 77 22 167 30 154 78 42 170 48 144	I bet this will be demolished soon.  I will.
144	71 94 51 58 65 96 205 43 66 154 144	This building will be ash.
144	85 58 28 62 181 122 7 197 82 14 144	I just have a bad feeling they are going to drink til they pass out.
144	167 156 86 195 78 127 114 160 75 18 144	the speakers are enthusiastic not the listeners
144	136 165 5 6 151 84 1 34 159 186 144	The box is dark grey.
144	15 193 152 10 211 1 34 42 163 162 144	The woman on the right doesn't look too impressed.
144	200 34 9 210 70 202 67 16 198 163 144	Too dark to play
144	54 202 23 200 180 56 131 193 199 7 144	I hope this project didn't take too long..
144	143 148 96 199 162 170 166 82 189 23 144	Wish the focus was better.
144	190 87 33 8 115 174 9 132 69 148 144	These guys looked miserable plying their instruments
144	79 156 192 170 210 198 81 31 204 96 144	I don't want to get old like this guy.
144	24 118 66 93 164 168 206 39 23 171 144	`That's how I feel when I get out of bed, like superman who's costume got shrunk in the drier.
144	211 16 58 107 198 38 76 145 99 74 144	this doesn't make me too happy.
144	15 109 117 20 97 24 76 151 7 146 144	The light blue just makes me sad.
144	140 95 23 28 31 50 27 16 41 32 144	I would be careful, winter can be so spooky.
144	164 111 194 104 131 108 31 16 185 113 144	probably a crappy band
144	24 84 27 45 187 86 191 11 103 119 144	He looks like a satan worshipper
144	99 78 79 25 44 148 21 168 166 213 144	How dreary is this brain
144	208 125 193 214 50 191 171 122 164 213 144	Why does the snow always have to go away?
144	121 156 90 33 163 37 18 214 83 89 144	It is sad that someone is in the position that they have to beg.
144	6 186 25 16 58 195 197 38 24 56 144	Just a clear, boorish and plain color.
144	200 79 7 75 92 139 56 97 178 23 144	Why even look at these beautiful flowers when they're going to die in a few days or weeks?
144	65 69 113 76 19 191 90 197 104 176 144	The last time my cords got tangled, my headphones broke
144	113 10 94 51 34 141 46 158 190 75 144	the day isn't looking good
144	31 43 21 50 60 59 30 116 48 130 144	No one knows who I am inside.
144	131 202 150 37 115 45 122 15 94 194 144	RIP. I'll miss you buddy...
144	140 124 16 102 209 93 123 24 53 49 144	This outing has me down in the dumps.
144	140 186 78 7 193 143 99 1 198 133 144	this city is dark and desolate
144	122 162 148 8 141 173 134 81 205 11 144	This place is to dark. Probably won't even be able to read the menu while i sit by myself.
144	63 116 27 189 190 96 179 5 36 93 144	Good set of toys
144	99 41 156 10 191 6 66 196 37 71 144	This makes me depressed.
144	146 208 172 68 34 147 56 88 104 65 144	The next Kurt Cobain hopefully
144	86 173 34 204 69 132 25 166 73 14 144	Looks like a funeral took place.
144	15 177 201 113 106 92 11 21 116 117 144	Leonard Cohen would never wear his signature hat again.
144	87 187 92 52 176 41 193 38 178 103 144	Being stuck out in the woods is not what I wanted to do today.
144	113 121 182 94 39 25 195 41 8 98 144	I bet the money is trying to hide from predators again
144	92 65 152 68 83 201 62 193 171 53 144	that field needs trees, it looks lonely
144	201 34 210 193 121 203 100 93 195 161 144	It looks like a death trap.
144	28 47 146 132 117 187 214 104 92 13 144	There are fish in there that could swallow that boat whole.
144	71 6 84 191 164 73 11 168 184 32 144	Dolphins like that may be extinct before we know it, and it is too late.
144	122 66 197 177 157 75 26 158 154 9 144	Such a mundane view.
144	95 142 45 163 103 161 38 178 77 189 144	I used to love red cars, but after my ex cheated on me in mine I can never look at them the same.
144	2 150 7 170 106 32 11 161 4 76 144	This photo is so bland.
144	111 168 169 174 145 117 211 90 77 205 144	The falseness of their smiles just shows how fleeting life really is.
144	133 108 49 182 93 36 149 126 55 28 144	One degree above freezing and fog, ugh.
144	190 140 163 129 213 141 130 66 14 209 144	I could really use a drink right now.
144	52 88 90 203 118 13 135 211 113 116 144	I could never afford this.
144	140 73 135 164 81 99 45 56 88 7 144	So many people are out having a nice day...too bad I'm not one of them.
144	24 197 188 158 84 213 119 149 108 180 144	Why are they picking those guys up?
144	205 122 44 50 107 36 90 147 57 215 144	And that ogre eats the kid in 3...2...1
144	3 59 134 56 215 116 173 214 199 25 144	Reminds me of when times were better...
144	99 87 108 1 85 96 110 102 211 148 144	A boring concert, reminds me of the good old days, not good anymore.
144	82 152 26 81 12 158 114 201 30 148 144	Even new blooms can't make it better.
144	17 59 80 116 214 107 35 182 203 22 144	its a advertisement
144	69 200 190 157 1 206 187 131 173 96 144	Oh,there aint no way this will do. I mean just LOOK at the color scheme.
144	195 159 169 122 136 183 37 69 101 131 144	It looks dark and depressing in this water.
144	54 53 141 104 39 163 185 120 202 89 144	I should have them play at my funeral.
144	145 135 161 120 56 58 71 205 209 124 144	The background is weird looking.
144	182 123 88 61 179 154 36 135 35 110 144	Thousands died in Angkor Wat
144	37 190 48 10 26 106 52 170 142 70 144	dark as my soul
144	13 167 189 141 73 10 81 71 52 12 144	Driving down  these back roads  can  make me  very gloomy
144	164 169 46 79 147 15 70 56 130 113 144	THE WITCH FROM TRANSYLVANIA LIVES HERE
144	89 35 168 11 191 61 26 76 123 203 144	The blue color of the usb makes me feel depressed... I would certainly buy it to match my mood
144	6 88 130 3 128 204 202 137 187 17 144	This is very unappealing looking green, makes me just want to stay inside.
144	99 35 95 193 126 165 105 155 54 128 144	I bet a bunch of awful things happen behind those doors.
144	183 46 155 136 201 40 150 209 99 141 144	Wow, this is grim - capitalist creep is going to kill the planet.
144	105 83 23 14 157 18 161 95 154 38 144	What a sad disruption of a beautiful landscape. Humans really bum me out sometimes.
144	2 132 48 85 100 28 186 138 185 212 144	Going to rain on our parade
144	58 210 23 81 8 190 134 4 168 24 144	i wish i could be like this jellyfish and swim from all my problems
144	12 150 21 136 34 83 16 85 38 124 144	Notice how the Autumn is less, and less vibrant?
144	14 133 79 152 180 77 140 164 61 150 144	Isn't it sad how photoshop means that even simple pictures of a tree end up like this heavily edited beast. It's just a sad state of the world
144	106 86 182 196 186 19 23 102 158 205 144	Rural areas like this really are dying out.
144	138 204 175 120 157 106 77 198 182 71 144	The factory is destroying the Earth.

145	127 134 38 83 151 82 120 163 46 153 145	Interesting looking church with stone walls
145	87 81 167 72 119 128 76 194 108 104 145	I wonder how old that tree is
145	15 162 147 59 26 175 78 204 192 199 145	This photo is clearly located in an older area but as to where, I have no clue, I just know I'd love to visit and explore one day too.
145	126 57 158 198 154 22 67 6 68 175 145	I wonder how the pandas sit up like that

146	42 19 194 52 160 161 13 35 135 69 146	The way the light is reflected in the waters adds depth to this photograph.
146	48 127 43 183 117 165 73 90 63 170 146	The variety of ages and heights of the children, along with the colorful clothing is eye-catching.
146	159 134 110 178 80 54 13 18 92 125 146	A nice day at the theatre

146	122 21 22 50 99 40 13 185 20 129 146	Fountains are so peaceful and inspiring. How can this guy be yawning sitting in such a beautiful place?
146	78 148 21 164 40 162 76 84 25 82 146	Is he playing hockey or is he posing for the camera?
146	76 200 168 21 170 62 49 54 133 78 146	The perspective here is so good.
146	88 161 165 127 115 109 70 16 192 152 146	I love the way the lights come together in the center on the stage. The crowd gives the photo a very cool vibe as well.
146	193 45 135 1 69 119 99 89 2 94 146	Who are you looking at?
146	53 189 197 200 168 92 178 94 134 15 146	Why does he have his head covered?
146	98 81 48 41 77 94 88 207 167 176 146	What a quaint little downtown area! I bet they have fun art festivals in this town.
146	5 31 119 84 99 71 101 82 79 60 146	That's Lance from my favorite band!
146	164 201 102 206 169 2 151 188 20 80 146	The picture of the biker is very skillfully taken.

146	141 93 55 26 153 159 95 79 165 128 146	I've always loved dance shows; this one reminds me of a Degas painting.
146	4 198 35 89 24 195 36 95 111 70 146	It would be so cool to make a collage using all of those pieces! Or a chandelier...
146	180 139 130 86 194 68 21 76 77 48 146	This picture of birds feeding each other would look great in a portrait hanging on living room wall.
146	215 11 38 141 32 1 58 165 2 45 146	These flowers grow to perfection,.
146	47 151 147 44 10 94 181 111 123 42 146	What a neat car and track.
146	134 46 161 215 209 64 103 155 37 160 146	The brushwork on this is clean and neat. The image is creative and expresses a lot about the person's personality.
146	149 26 128 126 70 197 82 174 147 210 146	The colors and the symmetry of all the circular gauges in this car are perfect!
146	2 156 155 143 66 93 78 129 157 92 146	Spiraling staircases are always so mysterious.
146	58 212 106 214 45 33 103 10 88 115 146	There is a artistry that lies between the two walls.
146	189 198 70 28 116 66 137 106 50 4 146	The white balance in the photo is sublime
146	174 109 23 150 76 56 167 108 192 52 146	In a sunset state of mind; sunset mindset
146	54 125 41 98 171 188 102 105 62 169 146	The snow lays in artful mounds.
146	47 75 33 101 108 68 181 140 171 194 146	Must be color coded
146	10 65 27 82 97 119 147 62 84 118 146	Gold makes every day things classy.

147	120 113 43 52 121 86 201 93 54 162 147	This makes me think of the book "A Madness of Angels!" I would read that book before I ran away to join clown college.
147	56 83 111 25 109 106 96 48 31 129 147	I wonder if the guitars are happy that they get played, you know? I like to think all things have a personality like that.
147	118 208 133 114 86 98 71 182 38 76 147	An arial view of a radio tower would be the perfect for an adventurous person to climb.

147	204 47 152 201 119 19 21 151 117 26 147	I could totally jump from that brown building to the grey one. Not even a problem.
147	155 208 197 54 163 39 192 19 142 4 147	It is crazy to think that the sign is there

147	163 153 138 177 206 148 81 108 187 116 147	This car is driving the wrong way.

147	106 53 172 73 209 185 21 38 65 18 147	Why people keep gathering in public places?

147	110 185 186 124 18 29 59 3 215 127 147	it's probably a naughty joke
147	133 187 50 95 73 150 88 196 170 8 147	That is a very small portion of food for an adult.
147	161 65 209 205 67 194 165 24 27 142 147	What a crazy road!
147	144 170 69 121 105 36 15 182 211 22 147	I see someone found my church hat.

147	74 136 193 211 32 149 151 128 177 212 147	This color is a bit too colorful for me
147	212 121 155 4 36 29 44 136 56 149 147	I want to stand on top of the chair and scream.

147	23 121 140 9 123 52 104 120 177 101 147	THIS LADY LOVES TO PLAY SOCCER BUT PLAYS HORRIBLY.
147	116 77 211 81 24 49 203 144 143 208 147	We totally just won the race.
147	115 83 61 51 50 68 116 52 105 97 147	get a chair
147	93 14 47 166 51 36 17 73 114 74 147	thats an ugly color
147	101 143 117 63 62 192 121 11 132 55 147	That cake is just too much!
147	152 28 66 212 174 179 71 45 20 190 147	Wearing sunglasses indoors are just so cool
147	45 25 11 184 101 131 106 112 75 39 147	Why is a child dressed as I bride? Who is doing her make up typhoid mary?
147	11 77 144 148 188 133 173 214 101 76 147	It's absurd how unpleasant one girls looks.
147	152 83 66 210 52 106 176 171 150 202 147	If I was that hut, I'd be so proud right now.
148	173 36 23 115 88 43 191 168 192 114 148	This looks like the last day of summer.
148	109 116 19 34 195 193 150 18 167 25 148	This photo reminds me of death
148	111 94 211 138 91 134 173 106 121 163 148	She promised she was never going to get married.  Now I will be lonely forever.
148	31 158 74 189 212 116 28 13 108 127 148	High school is one of the worst parts of a person's life.
148	86 212 16 100 145 139 24 201 114 141 148	I remember when I used to live in an apartment in the city years ago...
148	171 204 215 104 13 194 132 84 168 165 148	They don't have much time left.
148	194 99 204 107 147 57 197 11 66 183 148	This kid is too small to drive.
148	112 24 58 16 32 57 119 70 186 193 148	This house just looks so dull and drab. Nothing looks interesting or happy.
148	2 54 30 174 78 29 113 199 214 215 148	It's lunch time, I guess you have to eat something.
148	57 165 149 23 193 14 26 96 20 163 148	The fall is such a dismal season
148	77 116 87 154 159 110 127 81 22 52 148	It's a metaphor for how empty I am
148	146 188 69 187 33 19 151 135 90 102 148	This field makes me happy and sad at the same time
148	38 95 108 30 165 55 80 147 154 127 148	This island makes me really sad
148	27 169 81 132 78 202 183 64 155 177 148	I remember hanging out with my friends when I was that age
148	122 25 163 19 43 118 214 18 83 1 148	i wish it were brighter.
148	2 71 82 201 137 185 154 195 91 191 148	I wish that I could spend more time in the woods.
148	165 40 87 94 193 69 9 196 168 43 148	This place is as gloomy as my dark soul.
148	211 39 113 140 204 9 114 149 116 52 148	Back home reunited with old friend
148	137 27 38 72 116 185 195 120 134 199 148	Sadly just two lonely people
148	95 55 168 80 133 85 30 197 19 171 148	These guys remind me of the time my horse died.
148	9 33 205 195 86 89 39 197 13 212 148	That poppy reminds me of grandad.
148	104 208 195 11 85 51 125 107 72 77 148	This makes me blue...
148	77 36 28 138 81 40 188 203 157 84 148	This man looks so sad!
148	163 190 158 17 46 111 129 120 38 87 148	This music does nothing for me...
148	191 102 61 159 201 87 24 107 76 101 148	Dreamy photo of a dreamy lady.
148	213 2 102 159 42 176 178 138 39 35 148	I remember when these signs used to be posted all the time because of the weather. Looks like that's happening again.
148	105 145 63 87 101 118 12 78 176 74 148	The sad thing is, with out an air pump this army will soon fail.
148	116 213 124 63 143 41 13 190 192 61 148	Its so grey and kind of lonely even though there are people.
148	147 46 198 176 10 136 152 159 108 213 148	It's beautiful, though haunting, how vast the universe is and how little of it we will see in our lives.
148	13 120 189 83 198 143 12 127 75 132 148	thats a nice photo
148	43 123 155 150 159 100 204 60 87 167 148	How relaxing to stair at.
148	137 14 112 119 124 182 20 130 145 48 148	This looks like some Soviet-era architetcutre. But it could easily be from a U.S. city. Isn't it sad how there's no individuality to our cities anymore.
148	194 74 123 66 130 206 129 190 17 30 148	One day even the rocks we know will disintegrate.
148	11 15 123 6 151 209 45 174 211 142 148	We're going to be taking off soon and soaring above the ground. I hope we don't crash.
148	107 210 173 45 94 169 4 166 2 56 148	It is just another day of shopping.
148	93 193 178 23 8 13 173 191 70 203 148	Looks like a calm day out on the lake.
148	36 178 154 45 164 197 38 185 174 41 148	blue balloons make me so sad
148	63 180 190 22 87 188 195 72 204 182 148	His eyes make me feel sad
148	134 146 116 206 181 149 68 91 168 49 148	Wispering shadows, dancing along the walls.
148	23 9 184 125 1 117 5 18 190 6 148	Why does this glass define me
148	65 174 169 105 47 211 180 134 42 43 148	Alone, all alone, just like this water tower. That is how I feel.
148	215 153 181 134 22 10 27 112 175 184 148	This brings back the good old days.
148	203 193 6 194 48 154 22 111 31 179 148	What a sad end for Christmas lights
148	21 68 67 38 71 166 135 195 121 106 148	Oh, a building.
148	122 184 36 201 103 178 142 38 162 175 148	Different shades of the same thing
148	26 21 22 208 10 91 165 62 92 107 148	Those poor horses, I wish better for them.
148	88 196 7 110 155 83 119 48 149 176 148	school girls are sitting in ground
148	1 57 67 197 60 192 202 66 211 26 148	Oh my, this green just makes me sad.
148	133 81 153 158 67 90 138 186 12 53 148	Originally, fairy tales were more depressing than the Grimms make us think.
148	169 155 187 154 44 3 183 119 114 196 148	I think I'd feel sad sitting here all by myself.
148	149 29 78 125 122 37 17 203 32 206 148	I'll never travel that far.
148	173 42 59 29 78 158 25 62 8 166 148	I cannot get too excited about eating a bug.
148	179 161 13 163 138 112 90 79 158 186 148	Industrial places like this are always so cold. I guess it's fitting.
148	165 127 205 180 122 79 120 17 169 94 148	Another day have to be here
148	74 154 203 122 119 14 183 69 190 34 148	This must be what it's like to not go to a good school.
148	104 51 115 205 128 92 147 76 19 89 148	i wonder if they are gonna fight
148	103 197 177 60 200 91 156 178 38 190 148	[TIMEOUT]
148	121 203 68 7 164 67 39 97 77 53 148	I have been feeling sad.
148	134 78 144 56 70 1 8 117 103 172 148	I miss hanging out in crowds.
148	54 166 185 68 73 13 45 1 179 180 148	Oh to be young again
148	39 215 208 209 67 45 193 134 157 96 148	chip make us hip
148	88 136 87 73 132 170 166 159 46 30 148	They're so shiny when they're new, but what happens in the rain?
148	16 78 19 107 76 63 166 142 129 25 148	This reminds me of a better time. I wish I could go back to then.
148	4 67 40 39 60 26 102 57 176 194 148	Blue is sad
148	186 34 4 144 17 52 210 132 207 79 148	Sunset is the day dying. Everyone leaves, departs like these boats. We are moored ever so briefly, bobbing complacently in place... until we aren't. Unleashed, unmoored, and then - gone.
148	139 56 124 109 94 18 105 3 114 203 148	Wish I was there
148	152 75 79 89 110 134 174 86 146 96 148	It must be nice to be in love.
148	25 98 138 108 120 33 49 168 68 27 148	It looks like a sign to hell
148	19 92 14 193 130 79 202 215 165 123 148	I miss the days of long hair.
148	4 31 174 77 120 61 74 181 20 213 148	I wish I was there
148	109 206 67 185 158 118 187 3 115 92 148	missing the younger crowd.  wish they could be here
148	150 140 104 162 113 137 207 149 69 89 148	is this a unicorn
148	205 183 206 90 161 85 110 196 116 210 148	This place looks sterile and the windows remind me of a prison. I couldn't take having to look at it every day.
148	109 182 143 60 200 190 184 83 174 127 148	Solo performance by the legend
148	139 141 42 211 128 135 186 44 212 102 148	I love to be there and help wonderful people.
148	166 33 191 129 155 112 160 30 29 197 148	That stream just looks so depressing
148	45 23 153 51 72 6 151 170 137 54 148	I used to be able to run like that, before I was struck by a car.
148	71 61 65 6 123 149 115 113 111 89 148	I long for these days
148	28 52 187 153 195 77 2 94 20 101 148	I feel exactl
148	54 31 131 68 139 208 134 168 171 63 148	The narrow, lonely street, stark and cold, makes us feel sad.
148	153 73 131 44 40 50 88 107 197 20 148	reminds me of being dead
148	11 181 156 77 143 172 12 155 13 164 148	It sad how gloomy the rocks look.
148	196 120 139 150 194 88 78 57 1 189 148	It's so sad how that insect lives in its own tiny little world.
148	37 32 161 46 139 208 201 179 43 39 148	The naked men make me wish I was somewhere in my past.
148	2 88 4 70 188 126 211 119 15 190 148	The young man walked so arrogantly
148	31 183 41 116 100 137 39 22 86 205 148	I miss living in the big city.
148	31 200 117 56 147 153 91 45 112 132 148	What a depressing place to live
148	26 110 184 98 119 195 197 47 188 7 148	A lady with a helmet is posing for the picture.
148	135 25 64 83 124 78 5 113 81 165 148	The dessert plants are so starved from lack of water it's sad
148	45 205 12 75 181 128 6 77 122 53 148	All those trees...I bet it would be so easy to get lost.
148	111 154 214 51 85 156 92 37 72 44 148	Maps remind me of the good days when I was studying geography
148	214 154 90 122 178 115 199 215 167 45 148	The man is wondering.
148	72 48 150 100 165 107 126 147 84 112 148	this reminds me of my childhood
148	7 201 26 178 46 114 63 161 53 137 148	I remember when I was able to hold a stick
148	101 175 83 197 123 110 173 141 199 8 148	He looks desparately unskilled
149	18 142 157 132 211 184 133 60 10 165 149	this bird is nice love bird
149	113 26 9 119 30 190 157 147 90 78 149	They are only pretending to have fun.
149	78 24 140 151 84 56 81 213 79 3 149	I don't think that this truck is real because it looks really fake to me.
149	177 200 21 182 126 39 154 90 157 132 149	I don't believe that her team won the game.
149	158 20 207 167 182 94 11 57 31 206 149	I m searching for a good partner
149	173 107 196 76 212 72 179 175 7 157 149	Im questioning what is going on here
149	4 83 160 104 186 10 7 97 40 127 149	This salad doesn't look fresh.
149	145 108 81 18 131 107 192 150 135 113 149	They said there were UFOs. I said balogna.
149	47 37 107 32 115 25 127 78 40 128 149	I sure hope he's got a plan for landing safely.
149	58 108 57 173 200 1 60 142 176 16 149	I doubt that swing would hold an adult.
149	178 79 43 117 168 133 136 131 203 107 149	These people will finish last in the race.
149	4 197 11 46 115 126 75 99 17 142 149	I don't think these people will get there on time.
149	135 56 16 207 104 65 127 91 103 6 149	This photo looks fake.
149	26 69 67 75 81 165 131 6 76 14 149	This water looks like it was photoshopped.
149	47 14 141 3 181 75 186 16 92 4 149	A day with guitar
149	157 30 95 136 134 199 162 86 62 155 149	Are they sure they know what they're doing?
149	32 74 171 207 80 89 197 79 44 167 149	This looks photoshopped
149	83 172 63 128 16 133 151 56 11 144 149	What a bland building. Makes me dizzy too
149	143 70 193 145 112 166 19 141 52 97 149	Way too much flash. Makes her face look fake
149	84 17 58 43 72 81 118 89 47 12 149	I don't think any of these guys could outplay me in volleyball.
149	107 160 113 167 212 6 100 112 10 158 149	I doubt that formation is natural, the curves look to man made. Humans, always messing with nature. Also you can't see any curve. It's obvious the earth is flat.
149	103 82 83 31 86 147 163 91 46 120 149	Do people really pay for these?
149	189 85 181 67 182 32 176 104 18 72 149	I doubt those blinds even work
149	141 32 15 7 11 67 137 209 176 214 149	I don't know if that is even a bird.
149	150 115 171 118 162 113 158 46 12 5 149	I'm sure whoever made these did their best, but just because your kid made an ornament doesn't mean you should have to keep it long-term.
149	54 77 138 158 30 139 192 133 13 99 149	This speaker cant possibly know what he is talking about.
149	177 163 197 10 26 170 64 117 145 139 149	The serenity of nature....how long till they build a burger joint here?
149	131 136 106 28 211 111 64 104 71 37 149	I bet he's running out there for nothing.
149	140 38 124 177 12 67 213 157 25 184 149	Are colors real?
149	125 126 48 62 175 21 85 46 51 16 149	Suspicious, uncertain, inference
149	173 50 100 182 98 165 208 93 64 37 149	Those wings won't fly forever.
149	118 101 31 163 13 215 57 53 137 72 149	Surely DJs can be replaced by Spotify
149	92 210 111 193 198 112 79 58 69 131 149	There is no way that this is real.  Who could fight in that?
149	97 109 132 170 81 139 17 145 143 52 149	Nice picture, would be better if she didn
149	211 12 154 148 33 59 60 112 40 76 149	um, two men driving? no thanks...
149	38 27 76 63 40 74 118 28 113 204 149	I would be shocked if those colors are anything the human eye ever sees
149	158 112 195 43 66 39 105 67 180 27 149	That car probably isn't as fast as BMW.
149	111 173 102 10 208 168 164 171 199 88 149	I don't think those judges know what they're doing
149	39 133 198 82 91 164 107 159 131 103 149	I doubt mickey will be arounf for much longer
149	152 100 23 64 4 140 49 61 10 37 149	i bet that place doesn't even exist anymore
149	5 125 11 154 26 171 62 23 17 177 149	No I don't want to hear Wonderwall again.
149	28 201 163 200 114 15 160 151 104 70 149	Martial arts have no real-world benefit.
149	200 10 155 8 168 23 171 91 133 14 149	The area is too dark and gloomy
149	67 181 109 139 55 175 115 79 75 25 149	There is no way i'd be able to climb that thing!
149	38 165 195 160 40 87 92 185 167 29 149	This place isn't somewhere I would enter as I have a bad feeling about it.
149	210 114 211 144 77 70 173 45 164 62 149	I doubt the city will survive that storm, it may be bad, or maybe not.
149	76 58 154 2 199 152 88 60 179 213 149	I'm not sure we should go,  I've never seen a good show here.
149	128 211 204 214 206 186 8 10 45 17 149	I don't think they should e doing this outside. I'm not even sure if that's her real hair. Is that a costume? People just don't know how to dress. What is with the world?
149	34 108 62 131 194 132 127 124 102 203 149	Is she really interested in that stick, or just posing for the camera?
149	192 34 11 165 42 46 74 29 164 81 149	I doubt he'll be able to come down safely.
149	52 142 29 134 80 208 178 66 143 40 149	They were going to renovate this building, but I'm sure it can't be done.
149	203 51 132 118 129 17 172 34 133 49 149	Looks like a real depressing place for someone to live in.
149	212 108 37 88 181 45 198 9 29 42 149	They almost look like they think they're going to accomplish something.
149	208 106 72 167 137 204 23 12 33 66 149	I doubt those flowers will last long
149	1 199 105 66 40 67 137 2 124 50 149	Why is he sitting so far back? Not interested?
149	136 78 5 113 118 157 64 31 160 159 149	i dont think that grass is uncomfortable
149	205 188 165 208 121 193 118 32 57 186 149	How many cases of Norovirus are on that boat?
149	84 134 62 191 4 101 60 133 215 135 149	I don't think this hillside house is as beautiful and safe as the picture shows. I think it would be a terrible place to live honestly.
149	87 75 210 24 191 11 30 113 96 70 149	Look at the long shadows I bet the sun never came out that day.
149	25 136 150 174 70 199 20 28 44 189 149	Does it seem like it snowed there?
149	105 181 171 120 209 187 9 164 36 76 149	I doubt those bike handle bars are as good as mine.
149	9 39 22 143 170 131 79 43 29 100 149	SOmetimes people at these events "overrate" their qualities but perhaps his confidence is above normal.
149	141 84 189 69 124 162 176 115 103 206 149	"I don't really think this is made from magic beans."
149	206 150 214 73 2 22 27 158 32 54 149	Hm weird that the one guy is just lying there perfectly under his bike.
149	53 191 42 197 181 30 62 54 156 201 149	that light might go out and ruin the show
149	93 25 163 90 75 107 177 202 167 74 149	Well this marriage won't work.
149	65 34 98 6 157 210 7 197 181 99 149	hmm anything round the corner
149	186 144 195 161 94 135 168 106 45 58 149	I'm not sure if that soup is hot or not.
149	174 51 123 60 1 132 208 115 197 10 149	those children were told touch the grass, they aren't being cute.
149	127 9 181 198 168 173 174 1 190 210 149	Look at these folks using their phony smiles and fancy duds to mask how empty they feel inside.
149	120 109 139 155 49 72 30 179 25 53 149	Who was in charge of putting that deer statue there?
149	26 59 20 112 161 162 25 35 55 139 149	This looks poisonous.
149	75 82 4 164 205 201 5 193 123 214 149	The picture do not seem real
149	184 157 46 62 8 22 156 77 82 164 149	This location will never be a popular site in the city.
149	153 171 126 186 211 3 41 11 24 60 149	I don't think they'd finish this race
149	160 124 37 95 80 175 105 91 93 119 149	I hope it tastes better than it ooks
149	122 159 23 177 203 55 15 166 199 2 149	You want to build here? And what - watch your house disappear in the first storm?
149	4 164 5 185 194 156 79 30 15 137 149	I doubt this man has good intentions.
149	118 9 189 180 171 106 101 114 15 177 149	That guy has no idea what he is doing.
149	37 80 94 177 186 102 3 105 57 116 149	A very wonderful dancing couple is shown in the picture.
149	184 42 53 38 116 37 120 134 185 205 149	I doubt they're even friends :/
149	27 138 158 31 74 135 38 122 44 130 149	I really doubt this building is as old as they say it is.
149	181 128 130 17 48 212 178 80 133 76 149	I bet that isn't even real gold.
149	198 57 203 99 177 120 179 214 8 170 149	The flower will not survive the cold weather.
149	156 13 190 36 52 200 39 96 41 87 149	I bet that what they're doing is not that much fun. They may be paid to do that.
149	150 89 111 183 69 206 161 66 59 49 149	That building doesn't look all that tall.
149	195 123 34 117 185 68 61 33 19 16 149	I'm not sure what is green color made from.
149	53 69 178 20 52 108 181 102 34 173 149	The boys were not very cynical about going out of their adventure
149	138 49 185 207 90 57 132 147 100 205 149	i dont think the car will last
149	124 4 155 188 105 109 2 3 144 24 149	Blue sky fill with poison gasses
149	163 68 48 73 135 208 177 133 55 143 149	No one is getting through these appointments quickly.
149	2 146 45 90 40 202 119 19 106 78 149	i dont think those chairs are comfortable
149	49 174 80 132 148 206 26 9 183 203 149	That looks like it will fall and hit someone.
149	168 85 124 207 102 111 152 50 13 157 149	entertaining picture it is
150	177 26 89 131 20 90 207 32 192 101 150	A good time killer

150	149 194 202 16 3 172 207 32 85 114 150	Oh if only I could afford a vacation to the East Indies, I'd love to go hiking in the deep jungle!
150	92 120 167 31 96 81 105 89 84 61 150	would love to sit here and just drift away
150	190 184 164 211 15 26 153 67 194 166 150	I could get lost in this flower for hours.
150	180 136 44 38 113 130 58 185 187 2 150	What an accomplishment for a child, to draw their name in the sand.
150	14 182 105 189 103 49 54 71 142 66 150	I would put a mixtape on this and lose myself.
150	11 145 140 28 142 50 201 137 183 6 150	I don't care what people think I will wear orange every day!
150	61 132 44 117 154 161 165 157 160 199 150	I could lose myself in a long walk here.
150	62 97 152 131 126 169 181 48 46 167 150	So many little trees
150	170 81 73 113 53 27 188 69 70 109 150	I love disappearing into little ghost towns every now and then.

150	167 66 139 209 89 146 45 191 118 31 150	I wish I could just lose myself in those flowers
150	214 160 167 101 163 48 144 133 42 67 150	i could run away here forever
150	186 151 56 15 110 64 93 55 52 97 150	Comfort food. Simple times. Adventure is always needed.
150	100 53 1 127 163 80 202 14 140 194 150	She must be clinking her glass to something special.
150	47 131 134 109 66 152 16 69 53 22 150	I bet i could hide in that crowd and the cop would never see me.
150	167 38 213 115 18 189 7 124 202 197 150	This sculpture definitely stands out from the crowd. It is not for everyone's taste.
150	149 31 14 75 123 143 183 84 20 207 150	There is so much this boy will accomplish in life.

150	168 167 144 146 136 204 196 128 48 49 150	I could spend hours in that room, the pattern is mesmerising!
150	125 164 178 208 166 71 52 94 77 197 150	What an opportunity to take in this fresh air and enjoy the sounds of the waves.

152	161 36 160 42 48 166 60 79 90 207 152	Wait until they taste it. HOT
152	72 94 105 111 173 93 175 14 172 199 152	All tuckered out, lets give kitty a coffee
152	96 2 11 158 111 77 91 132 139 180 152	Umberellas lol... not for me.  I'd be running around there getting them all soaked lol.
152	207 45 63 78 143 74 89 27 9 131 152	What a fantastic beast kind of a car!
152	59 138 95 215 70 180 5 52 68 13 152	whoo hoo a partay!
152	187 211 175 198 207 21 135 173 190 106 152	Woo, this would be a great place to party and have some fun!
152	122 68 204 25 172 88 213 134 126 53 152	I feel like toilet papering all of it
152	155 11 94 44 83 62 72 53 197 65 152	I would love to punch a hole in that stupid set!
152	128 74 56 160 86 85 78 24 14 190 152	seashells on a seashore!
152	138 36 79 84 82 13 139 135 180 149 152	this one looks like a robot with two buttons
152	164 26 161 4 203 133 111 34 213 180 152	I bet you I can climb up that clock tower.
152	211 124 29 69 18 150 16 66 127 44 152	That looks like a great place to wrestle.
152	52 59 64 68 49 191 153 123 209 144 152	I don't think they are cooking those right.
152	210 101 67 132 65 133 31 102 160 59 152	RAWRAWRAWR THIS LEAF ME ALONE!
152	90 127 194 12 28 120 112 135 188 95 152	A lot of people enjoying a beautiful place.
152	178 109 120 108 182 212 165 170 16 213 152	That's a wild looking bird there!
152	193 46 199 112 208 144 64 177 200 15 152	here comes the crowd to watch!!
152	23 86 113 51 99 84 7 120 5 187 152	He's gonna light this place up
152	55 74 190 31 98 155 41 121 27 141 152	WOW A DOG!!! I CAN NOT BELIEVE THERE IS A DOG! I LOVVE DOGS SO MUCH!!!
152	162 19 22 171 133 98 198 172 48 145 152	Kind of an odd photo, not sure exactly what's going on here.
152	69 158 194 70 149 72 137 171 35 9 152	The old time boat makes me want to have some old time river gambling fun.
152	120 142 166 24 207 144 210 183 215 117 152	Oi, where's the rest of the bloody car?!
152	40 83 149 130 111 42 92 57 194 184 152	That spider probably bit that man
152	96 154 179 105 134 76 100 135 199 80 152	It looks like someone kicked that circular metal display. I just want to kick it some more.
152	136 52 100 32 98 30 184 85 190 144 152	The people behind the barriers need to get into this, show some energy, start a dance!
152	41 112 98 190 84 192 196 34 129 107 152	Hey!  That looks like a FUN crowd!
152	142 177 181 54 129 63 88 60 84 128 152	This looks like a great place to have a fight!
152	182 183 138 159 121 105 85 3 212 49 152	I want to climb that tree and fall out of it.
152	105 100 142 210 27 30 178 195 112 151 152	Win win win! Let's go!
152	20 137 39 114 81 177 155 132 157 22 152	time to party
152	47 199 27 173 126 111 29 114 23 161 152	yeah! hit that siren, lets have a loud bbq!
152	18 164 138 51 127 25 184 116 188 165 152	This microphone is very noisy
152	211 28 11 151 214 1 213 43 161 177 152	Shake it girl, shake it!
152	166 58 138 109 215 193 86 170 132 87 152	Here's a crowd that would be fun to send a drone into, and scare the life out of them lol.
152	62 39 65 78 27 183 138 110 10 148 152	looks like things are about to kick off with the blue shirts hahaha
152	120 112 176 113 194 81 55 117 130 151 152	Its getting hot in here,
152	132 7 72 156 118 154 142 73 155 130 152	I could see a crazy good time here.
152	149 185 69 30 10 46 194 44 12 169 152	Why would you ever draw a 3D picture without taking into account lighting, shading, and perspective?
152	187 53 76 74 171 99 197 57 38 190 152	Wish I were there--looks like a rockin party scene!
152	17 9 202 201 42 138 37 100 19 121 152	This place needs loud music and a big crowd to liven things up
152	167 203 15 56 162 36 181 199 18 140 152	I will race these 2 all day.  Nvm that it would annoy their Mom lol.
152	8 74 145 25 89 215 82 147 211 18 152	Woohoo! The sun goes down and it's party time!
152	184 53 112 95 140 159 104 30 69 176 152	Bright colors excite me.
152	51 196 86 160 78 191 109 186 131 81 152	I want to jump up and down
152	169 202 138 111 207 170 175 86 76 71 152	That looks like a place to have a party!! Lots of space for people and music!
152	38 131 185 214 170 109 24 92 100 4 152	he should run around and make funny noises!
152	196 11 99 74 2 147 42 30 77 137 152	They look like a wild bunch.
152	210 202 201 178 82 27 58 99 158 71 152	This place is so noisy and crowded.
152	167 104 199 172 47 146 91 207 215 120 152	This makes me want to scream.
152	157 89 181 186 110 129 147 141 118 47 152	Bring him another one!
152	210 140 212 38 185 8 46 57 19 132 152	Oh man, this is some fantastic artwork we've got here, yes it is.
152	161 3 48 23 90 98 34 54 163 127 152	I bet those kids are going to dig their ways out.
152	137 145 88 45 29 80 55 132 164 174 152	Ah the Soviets, unfinished business with them I have
152	116 90 57 92 133 75 10 70 198 28 152	I want to play with that dog.
152	20 168 29 112 22 95 174 203 56 199 152	Haha, wish I was there too, drinking some booze!
152	74 3 17 44 60 112 202 85 139 65 152	I wish I could skydive from that tallest building.
152	31 121 213 205 44 9 115 101 150 57 152	Let's get our water guns and spray some dorks.
152	37 101 77 5 189 164 185 202 76 179 152	This place looks excellent for hosting our next frat party!
153	183 11 94 116 208 195 161 142 64 154 153	This ostrich looks bored out of its mind
153	166 31 172 147 26 51 161 77 91 114 153	We just gon have to move all this hay here boy
153	79 111 214 86 34 11 202 181 200 74 153	Mixed tape? What is this, the 80s?
153	78 213 138 90 65 192 69 9 193 108 153	He's such a go getter.
153	57 190 68 50 44 30 86 201 139 66 153	cloudy, gloomy, grim
153	28 212 189 82 127 125 123 197 201 40 153	He's not that great at this.
153	147 47 184 183 150 141 173 11 86 46 153	Ok- I guess this was a fun night out.
153	112 96 107 47 165 44 26 146 22 8 153	That brick work needs fixing
153	127 37 24 208 76 188 192 40 157 79 153	bright city lights
153	114 86 120 82 129 208 97 77 146 3 153	I just don't see the fun in racing something that uses an excessive amount of gas and money for little pleasure.
153	148 1 21 83 212 15 43 181 92 47 153	Oh look you're taking a picture of your lunch. How original.
153	13 152 6 214 100 118 176 167 174 141 153	This reptile is the as rough as my skin.
153	189 193 34 210 204 212 179 79 122 142 153	Ya Alley? Sounds boring.
153	199 120 156 133 103 66 96 99 176 16 153	If you walk a little faster you can break the sweat that you want to.
153	2 17 101 196 167 166 3 119 175 139 153	Why didn't she get the fancy dress?
153	107 201 140 212 165 94 134 181 26 21 153	That bird looks rather boring.
153	120 128 9 26 188 170 63 139 171 193 153	Did they finally realize she wasn't wearing a bra?
153	119 124 196 189 90 63 27 167 140 197 153	looks pretty boring
153	104 96 193 55 30 31 123 48 69 24 153	Well that's the last time I try that recipe...
153	197 168 14 138 87 142 151 40 1 204 153	There's nothing in this photo.
153	6 144 19 122 115 40 129 49 20 50 153	Looks like water to me.
153	45 70 84 61 128 82 38 123 85 204 153	The bee keeper's work is never done
153	169 127 215 41 194 89 58 16 59 172 153	Another fish photo, how interesting.
153	109 150 20 213 197 36 52 190 120 215 153	Gee what a great shelf
153	179 17 53 178 188 51 99 12 42 134 153	What nice AND good birds
153	197 179 101 53 10 58 63 191 122 165 153	I'm not impressed by the scenery. It's rather boring.
153	173 56 187 43 170 194 15 70 2 159 153	A good fisherman
153	37 103 123 54 167 67 9 97 8 96 153	It's clear to see that this is transparent.
153	150 104 73 155 8 127 180 96 154 115 153	Well, I  know what I'm not doing, ever.
153	68 130 192 8 215 127 74 82 158 97 153	Someone could have cleaned the windows..
153	41 204 94 192 119 89 37 7 68 142 153	This is Vanessa on the throne!
153	22 77 209 53 101 163 129 41 174 175 153	Wow, so many colors
153	133 46 19 122 106 174 38 179 154 71 153	This body looks bland and boring.
153	209 1 168 212 35 116 114 77 106 180 153	3 busses walk into a bar...
153	29 168 164 32 19 64 165 55 27 211 153	The grass looks ok
153	170 183 130 31 161 47 195 49 93 86 153	Looks like someone forgot to water their grass.
153	149 23 2 176 155 60 27 75 65 120 153	Finding flowers here will take lots of imagination.
153	167 137 204 121 150 55 57 211 52 200 153	These cows are certainly pulling a lot of bags on that cart.
153	160 60 167 101 42 11 133 127 15 162 153	Buggy overlooking the city lights reflecting off the lake. It's cold and I want to go home.
153	144 191 78 25 203 173 93 131 83 192 153	This is a well-planned and fertilized garden.
153	94 16 59 154 24 119 160 109 184 117 153	There was no water anywhere.
153	190 130 47 188 29 168 66 112 113 91 153	This is  weird.
153	46 93 25 47 207 8 138 125 117 198 153	there should be more traffic
153	155 45 24 2 134 93 35 140 156 68 153	Wow. It's a building. How impressive.
153	178 66 99 103 30 197 61 71 188 44 153	Burning Man has declined lately.
153	38 206 66 89 61 114 45 75 64 98 153	This is pretty
153	147 46 172 62 174 87 211 135 203 85 153	This is a fixer-upper.
153	18 150 212 96 105 161 61 27 34 20 153	Bet those arent overpriced x.x
153	201 57 212 210 167 45 66 50 16 192 153	They must be very hot in their suits
153	57 77 205 68 149 17 134 116 188 64 153	is this desert color here
153	135 8 126 155 20 215 102 40 78 168 153	A dry sermon
153	78 214 115 25 182 133 121 210 16 32 153	As we can see, global warming is not a thing, these butterflies are totally drinking in clean water. great.
153	111 134 116 209 186 118 142 35 184 204 153	This is a very boring black image.
153	171 160 161 44 120 105 156 208 199 182 153	Why the huge football?
153	133 64 53 207 156 167 46 81 19 151 153	what exactly is this thing? Looks old
153	201 114 71 60 75 179 14 198 95 108 153	Big plane, small people
153	12 46 114 35 1 201 154 159 134 102 153	raising the bar with the suspenders
153	176 39 155 165 207 160 211 168 105 175 153	What is this even of?
153	38 146 85 210 25 55 152 75 122 169 153	Sediment is packed down in layers over time.
153	85 38 34 9 129 164 50 6 114 127 153	Very nice for a wedding
153	128 25 8 73 35 94 162 83 65 159 153	Green is just boring, makes me want to go to a bar and drink.
153	157 86 71 102 53 98 212 169 138 2 153	It is a good thing I am not teaching his swing.
153	112 40 19 84 1 207 147 165 3 187 153	Weak to the eyes
153	8 124 100 56 49 199 69 159 207 170 153	The game is not intresting
153	63 185 77 198 65 56 58 150 180 193 153	Very clean and well flanged plenty of arid ventelation
153	135 172 196 117 11 66 195 106 55 171 153	This is such a historical peice of art
153	43 162 103 42 202 93 144 115 74 112 153	This is a city.
153	135 87 83 177 57 92 119 128 21 101 153	His couch is black.
153	85 96 137 53 123 177 128 199 210 181 153	I don't think I need so much bamboo.
153	95 183 42 132 33 31 188 140 133 136 153	ah yes, roses and a ferris wheel
153	129 55 162 155 59 122 199 52 65 96 153	Isn't this the most beautiful sun you've ever seen?
153	161 98 54 65 58 183 123 186 28 61 153	cake to the face
153	123 72 116 189 80 17 44 22 9 19 153	This doesn't look like fun at all.
153	12 150 111 53 181 94 44 198 72 70 153	Thanks snow, I didn't want to swim today anyway
153	80 109 103 124 189 210 179 162 199 114 153	Eh, I guess this place is fine.
153	202 48 35 182 75 147 168 99 192 205 153	This man is probably about to get eaten by a tiger.
153	87 80 18 190 56 24 19 193 84 168 153	Looks like a cool place, I guess.
153	44 139 128 106 127 152 12 95 60 42 153	What a boring day.
153	115 130 38 26 63 39 152 70 4 176 153	Well this is a bland paint job isn't it.
153	97 33 3 200 81 44 83 17 157 54 153	That desert looks as dry as my soul.
153	41 64 40 120 95 176 97 204 83 69 153	The rain cleared, the sun came out and blooms are in full.
153	158 180 163 94 179 154 186 21 124 215 153	That bird is not much more exciting than that statue.
153	107 3 71 74 36 12 103 66 210 61 153	He's preparing food for consumption.
153	12 210 82 201 60 119 107 112 84 150 153	Its so cold and clear outside
153	152 9 186 48 1 19 204 215 145 112 153	It looks nice there, where are you at?
153	192 93 162 167 85 135 154 59 129 68 153	That's shack looks a little weathered.
153	55 173 192 117 69 122 74 57 39 34 153	That dog looks perturbed about his life.
153	41 111 1 126 43 22 37 185 168 58 153	Ok, two women what is the point here?
153	147 177 206 86 51 84 178 76 31 81 153	That dog is furry.
153	126 61 65 107 164 58 121 113 115 101 153	I like old trains.
153	35 16 12 4 122 209 21 166 79 32 153	How do they find running fun
153	81 145 185 2 147 4 165 121 41 186 153	A lot of red in this
153	28 17 84 173 107 62 11 82 94 132 153	seems like a regular tree
153	82 202 87 170 68 57 117 78 108 1 153	looks like they're having a lot of fun
154	26 144 69 20 3 36 212 57 93 37 154	The cat looks lost.
154	183 89 99 48 140 77 186 53 37 73 154	This is a parade, maybe?
154	168 30 116 102 169 183 79 97 167 151 154	Mario is looking for Luigi.
154	101 197 176 157 37 165 94 63 158 98 154	I don't know if I like the green or the pink
154	49 50 153 115 95 33 132 99 202 180 154	great shot you should post more
154	69 110 190 126 76 165 127 178 93 211 154	The colors are okay
154	20 74 153 191 75 193 110 32 188 134 154	I play guitar also.
154	80 96 10 136 56 114 198 20 79 102 154	This is a picture of people.
154	187 22 211 114 183 79 116 158 186 160 154	Looks good, but I don't really like sweets.
154	86 125 126 109 50 98 184 214 73 120 154	Looks like they may be arguing about something.
154	165 93 119 126 17 200 129 11 194 59 154	This ancient artifact is both interesting and boring.
154	139 158 211 46 159 109 13 127 189 21 154	Oh look. A little girl in a dress.
154	64 24 14 82 198 50 202 117 113 96 154	They are together.
154	135 118 12 155 151 156 69 110 106 190 154	this picture is ok
154	195 73 46 153 22 5 21 81 163 39 154	A nice picture of a tropical island
154	157 7 212 46 107 181 109 183 178 189 154	There are many people at this house.
154	12 30 149 33 3 84 92 186 86 145 154	This parade  float is ok
154	202 16 184 42 146 23 90 44 74 186 154	I appreciate this photo of the sky and a child.
154	150 34 125 89 163 196 188 52 95 1 154	Oh, wow, a protest. Great. Let's care about things today.
154	204 22 215 176 70 141 147 62 55 34 154	There are many cars.
154	25 151 29 18 111 142 75 41 76 83 154	what an oddly placed statue
154	182 39 150 111 193 41 51 180 64 47 154	Endor is where Ewoks live.
154	72 119 175 70 140 24 156 17 74 14 154	The land has mountains on it.
154	35 79 33 39 1 126 162 111 9 215 154	These are two statuses. It appears to be spring or autumn.
154	203 126 51 67 61 78 174 103 182 138 154	Its a field with a mountain in the back.
154	82 148 200 4 15 198 13 128 147 194 154	That is an interesting room, do kids stay there?
154	207 18 52 114 95 116 183 182 147 16 154	What a beautiful way to end the day.
154	152 93 151 104 55 145 133 213 72 158 154	The moon looked peaceful over the cold, cloudy sky.
154	206 147 194 31 118 75 74 209 104 13 154	that is a lot of green
154	15 30 36 147 88 93 58 119 10 139 154	The rooms looks crowded.
154	147 121 30 110 123 170 36 53 77 189 154	I could go either way.
154	34 7 89 12 140 110 138 167 148 85 154	Down a alley way
154	37 135 159 214 52 193 142 93 33 199 154	It's a cow. Or a bull. Whatever.
154	113 187 116 150 45 186 72 85 185 53 154	The bird is very colorful and confused.
154	38 1 43 156 75 166 93 60 196 210 154	This is a picture of the shoreline with rocks.
154	115 33 175 136 109 169 127 213 91 133 154	I have never seen a plant such as this.
154	168 24 43 112 181 138 51 62 10 210 154	Is that a swimming pool?
154	197 114 134 9 149 71 127 142 183 188 154	This is an interesting computer set up.
154	30 163 165 24 120 43 175 190 3 4 154	I love the silhouette. So mid evil.
154	112 63 56 16 29 102 109 136 145 206 154	the slug and the boy are in the picture
154	129 83 10 28 149 137 24 126 175 87 154	The room is empty
154	87 145 95 215 203 169 40 168 165 46 154	What a great picture.
154	53 92 174 13 24 187 191 93 34 84 154	ok..these may be good..dont know
154	27 145 146 131 18 64 81 62 204 94 154	This is probably very important to the people in the photo.
154	139 124 65 177 137 17 110 120 188 82 154	I am not sure about this
154	117 24 175 147 80 138 41 209 118 115 154	I don't hate rock music but I am not a fan either.
154	97 92 65 54 169 171 133 103 120 17 154	It doesn't matter which team wins this game to me.
154	114 20 165 51 132 185 96 75 43 39 154	That's an interesting vehicle.
154	167 44 208 102 90 103 149 39 104 15 154	They just opened up this new waiting room.
154	119 172 120 77 21 76 44 135 43 116 154	These kids are smiling.
154	148 113 123 126 41 146 116 7 206 74 154	SHE IS A BEAUTIFUL, SAD GIRL
154	14 194 147 30 16 144 112 67 9 208 154	I see Big Ben.  I don't have strong feelings about this either way.
154	125 38 193 209 130 165 22 89 66 173 154	I used to go see bands like this.
154	11 32 19 111 59 78 92 167 99 21 154	Song sheets from the past can be hard to conceive, I'm just glad that we don't see song sheets like that today.
154	164 145 22 139 178 45 127 114 185 96 154	I think I know someone like him.
154	11 215 179 140 156 80 98 32 114 135 154	I think the person that made this flyer has potential.
154	166 45 99 4 208 8 86 42 167 38 154	This photo utilizes several photography principles.
154	1 202 161 106 85 51 96 44 205 54 154	whatever it's just birds
154	117 130 89 77 1 120 103 123 115 139 154	Looks like a beautiful day out there!
154	76 97 129 60 187 22 24 49 121 188 154	In school or out of school, it really makes no difference.
154	55 49 169 48 93 9 158 186 113 43 154	I believe this was used in ancient times.
154	89 95 121 114 81 201 47 193 125 18 154	That water is very cold I bet.
154	13 83 2 169 212 168 141 74 208 137 154	This plant isn't any better looking or worse looking than the other plants.
154	49 210 153 24 208 200 6 166 155 18 154	Paying attention and listening to speaker
154	195 128 11 119 35 81 213 184 95 165 154	Okay...whatever.  Some sort of critter.
154	109 178 96 161 71 110 129 68 73 177 154	i like her clothes
154	83 163 32 210 63 150 28 44 146 114 154	That looks interesting.
154	51 160 124 215 94 36 66 202 130 62 154	It just looks like a fence with the sun behind it, nothing bad or great about it.
154	60 99 78 93 145 34 7 166 46 213 154	This looks boring, overgrown trees.
154	190 93 204 164 115 119 34 149 36 103 154	What is going on here I wonder?
154	121 13 145 65 76 86 191 94 103 27 154	That is pretty yellow
154	123 65 93 31 99 19 152 100 128 179 154	The color of the pavement was the same
154	153 207 65 140 22 121 101 112 186 7 154	I don't mind rock music.
154	131 102 84 48 116 175 73 5 161 173 154	Maybe practicing for a speech.
154	50 49 211 55 48 152 81 184 153 209 154	They are just 2 good friends.
154	11 37 46 196 212 136 72 6 57 59 154	Someone could have broken that
154	25 43 146 88 180 159 177 149 178 8 154	The sea is very tranquil and poetic.
154	160 69 19 150 165 187 97 8 145 95 154	I would go here
154	58 201 103 130 74 11 32 135 163 40 154	I like the birds. I also like the tick. Who am I to judge?
154	2 119 34 171 33 126 151 15 149 51 154	To me, it's just an ordinary sky.
154	182 184 205 53 165 186 191 119 174 48 154	The debris is clearly visibly strewn throughout the land.
154	7 8 45 11 117 10 193 199 149 129 154	This is a party
154	150 76 186 205 49 102 119 57 182 202 154	sure..ill go here if you want
154	135 164 5 19 186 78 63 23 60 35 154	Pit teams need to be fast
154	1 80 207 204 22 90 102 30 144 91 154	It's kinda pretty.
154	193 131 174 19 141 149 43 160 185 159 154	Looks like a regular day in Florida.
154	54 196 96 198 65 178 137 95 177 194 154	I respect this guy for competing.
154	53 179 187 163 65 199 97 58 98 93 154	What a nice day!
154	159 161 120 162 215 164 4 68 98 132 154	That looks like it's positively okay to me.
154	162 107 215 67 212 113 199 86 93 31 154	Meh. It's all right.
154	185 44 178 3 135 125 150 170 43 194 154	I am neither turned on or off.
154	94 63 215 86 110 107 140 57 157 172 154	Brown, black whats the difference
154	199 21 149 18 3 197 41 156 77 22 154	I'm not saying that I'd go out of my way to go to this event, but those cars are nice to look at.
155	101 80 178 210 168 175 97 84 199 173 155	Be easy to burn it all down
155	66 142 110 77 55 8 98 164 91 167 155	This water looks so good.
155	42 169 130 197 44 213 190 109 91 112 155	Great place for a tragedy
155	128 186 115 106 145 210 202 33 64 48 155	I hope he crashes his truck
155	65 153 198 141 150 205 199 4 48 159 155	Whoever illustrated these books need not quite they're day jobs.  Sorry, not sorry!
155	167 104 61 205 23 150 56 73 83 89 155	Maybe he should buy a larger and safer care so he wouldn't look so ridiculous riding around in a car wearing a helmet. Come on!
155	127 27 24 211 49 18 122 117 39 192 155	I'd cover up, if I were the man on the sculpture
155	92 69 120 54 32 190 38 147 144 5 155	natures is god gift very sper picture
155	17 148 180 86 197 170 143 27 185 140 155	I'm going to mess up your day.
155	125 158 63 69 133 193 82 77 24 18 155	whoever bought those seats is an idiot.
155	106 49 196 52 214 171 212 110 167 68 155	This guy is probably thinking he's gonna get lucky, but he likely has absolutely nothing to offer any decent woman with half a brain.
155	116 95 71 212 63 46 65 90 70 170 155	Gross. Those walls haven't been cleaned in years!
155	14 118 164 67 208 20 107 52 142 130 155	I hope they fall
155	127 173 117 193 10 29 165 25 83 130 155	Low painting quality imo
155	158 12 139 136 167 18 74 101 122 93 155	What a tool box.
155	12 102 107 156 213 119 70 105 150 182 155	we should kill and eat all these birds
155	36 166 211 213 71 129 157 138 214 168 155	I wonder what the artist wanted to represent here?
155	142 182 210 103 36 113 50 59 10 29 155	I would push every one of these people over.
155	48 58 92 212 169 36 141 75 39 157 155	What if somebody fell off that ledge?
155	74 14 80 113 110 175 71 197 196 192 155	The painter didn't use the right colors.
155	106 75 162 25 130 51 16 195 214 64 155	I wonder how many people have fallen off.
155	27 125 179 213 173 154 63 187 121 183 155	The gas kills
155	142 172 51 99 176 156 197 78 93 185 155	I want to blow up that mountain with dynamite.
155	133 126 164 154 213 169 74 106 153 81 155	What an ugly building.
155	150 194 81 74 106 51 122 53 13 107 155	Wind farms aren't a great use of space or technology.
155	104 61 7 1 103 76 165 23 183 68 155	The Tooth Fairy didn't show up last night..so I'm gonna stay up til she comes and squish her!
155	122 56 207 167 206 118 91 83 215 25 155	Your child needs to stay there so he can't mess anything up
155	33 157 60 130 124 48 4 126 17 178 155	Did this project receive any praise?
155	87 164 134 22 118 10 31 54 138 186 155	The shoes are just disgusting.
155	97 5 113 57 146 205 48 69 24 52 155	The ceremony looks so bad.
155	41 139 43 156 198 92 51 42 9 35 155	She'll probably leave him.. he's too short.
155	206 54 55 137 191 26 132 116 140 79 155	I would hate to be stuck in the middle of these ugly people.
155	18 24 5 42 124 46 104 72 50 100 155	Too bad you'll never get to experience this amazing view
155	85 28 96 126 213 205 98 72 110 25 155	Suicide launch pad.
155	171 149 22 71 37 106 182 113 58 143 155	Why can't these people sit down and get out of the way! Some people can't stand around talking all day and have a life.
155	144 207 206 210 129 66 25 17 204 12 155	That’s a stupid picture. Hate to be there
155	56 19 143 93 101 202 69 50 149 194 155	Surprised that someone actually gets married  nowadays.
155	151 76 152 50 1 30 125 187 201 215 155	Let's throw it all on the floor so she will have to clean it up.'
155	184 165 5 159 124 20 164 15 14 101 155	They shouldn't deserve the award
155	17 158 116 197 30 43 71 157 21 69 155	I would totally rip this plant to shreds.
155	203 15 104 88 166 174 154 79 194 207 155	I would laugh if that guy fell off and crushed someone.
155	55 184 89 170 122 19 36 154 25 37 155	That shade of green looks terrible on you!
155	108 167 6 195 128 46 39 187 3 90 155	SHe is very talented and hard working
155	173 107 147 123 119 174 200 9 114 11 155	This child has the worst hair I have ever seen!
155	76 94 90 78 147 35 200 180 20 72 155	You never know how nature is going to cut it's path for you.
155	105 69 70 190 142 46 201 171 157 199 155	Go get some real shoes.
155	77 94 204 188 130 57 128 55 13 165 155	That swing looks juvenile
155	207 122 140 128 202 119 115 20 138 37 155	Way too spiky for me.
155	98 211 14 186 35 100 65 150 143 180 155	I wonder how much she had to be paid to kiss him.
155	190 93 198 163 4 133 171 46 145 177 155	I left my litter down here. I don't care if it hurts the wildlife. They're just dumb animals.
155	1 116 4 201 86 113 117 64 188 126 155	These girls are ugly.
155	138 17 100 198 45 190 85 36 122 89 155	I hope she falls
155	131 200 124 91 43 136 141 203 2 77 155	looks nearly frozen to death
155	103 74 174 123 97 11 50 200 148 55 155	What a stupid pink shirt.  Wonder if his mom bought it for him.
155	29 82 91 154 185 179 20 139 64 34 155	I'd laugh if the door swung open and hit her
155	109 35 78 105 56 156 166 100 54 17 155	I hope they are traveling to a retirement home.
155	70 154 195 143 90 54 207 191 95 24 155	im glad that parking lot is empty
155	176 77 30 161 9 16 29 183 52 165 155	I bet that guy has no idea what he is supposed to be doing.
155	51 36 166 135 14 144 143 77 211 101 155	This is a terrible picture. The lighting is really bad.
155	174 28 80 81 91 92 66 137 26 117 155	I don't understand how anyone can drive on that narrow street.
155	69 150 22 115 83 42 38 45 161 67 155	How many potatoes had to die to feed you!
155	200 95 207 135 1 71 108 78 125 110 155	What a horrible color of purple that building is!  They should throw away the whole building.
155	37 24 53 79 133 137 77 180 89 170 155	Kill yourself with these pointless images.
155	81 115 65 108 45 173 74 26 126 58 155	A failing truck from a terrible company.
155	147 89 172 194 158 97 26 165 99 56 155	i will break it
155	103 196 81 130 74 203 191 98 90 114 155	why would you eat that lobster you monster
155	87 45 2 73 170 58 99 191 121 181 155	bugs, who would feed someone bugs.
155	192 179 157 120 42 62 175 142 64 56 155	Whoever designed that logo should not call themselves an artist.
155	43 213 156 122 167 101 88 196 180 56 155	The rocks were hiding animals.
155	185 110 46 23 19 21 51 154 57 71 155	There is way too much selection on this menu, and none of them even seem appetizing!
155	120 186 178 174 164 117 75 68 81 211 155	I'd love to see these women trip over their own feet.
155	145 181 53 105 111 84 17 24 140 215 155	These number wheels are abysmal. Whoever thought of such an awful idea should be fired immediately.
155	34 139 168 203 186 185 184 174 207 138 155	Wow, this is really kitch boat.
155	22 18 121 135 67 81 167 112 120 144 155	Flowery on the 2nd floor balcony
155	2 179 55 102 192 154 175 115 170 174 155	Looks like feces.
155	167 67 187 116 108 196 212 128 202 73 155	Writing on this place is not right.
155	29 107 86 199 66 28 25 49 134 149 155	Look at this rusted piece of crap.  Who in their right mind would waste time and money on this?  Only an idiot thats who.
155	123 93 126 142 26 41 23 166 199 129 155	What a terrible looking couple, seems like they haven't had haircuts in years.
155	15 64 164 93 200 99 197 186 117 136 155	That girl has a pointy chin and over tanned skin.
155	16 5 42 208 107 185 104 158 8 206 155	You guys should go home and stop being weird.
155	28 199 121 20 89 105 21 63 66 179 155	I don't think that man is really tall.
155	63 85 156 169 107 100 98 151 4 130 155	Saddening and Lost
155	128 153 114 158 113 91 180 27 183 17 155	someone probably jumped off that at some point
155	47 215 152 70 149 65 112 144 136 91 155	The guitar doesn't look like it's that expensive
155	45 197 62 44 35 41 213 71 52 157 155	this looks stupid
155	105 88 159 185 59 40 176 84 30 58 155	They ought not to put this here
155	152 66 132 135 99 149 97 54 137 158 155	I hope he broke a bone performing this stunt!
155	8 80 148 3 38 53 93 180 54 121 155	Looks like your about to bite you tongue, good.
155	48 102 205 8 94 162 157 192 161 77 155	I don't like the Jericho photo and dim lamp.
155	41 97 144 4 25 138 188 168 140 149 155	the bottle gives off a cruel image.
155	130 114 80 153 192 139 49 131 182 112 155	I hope this car cannot be fixed, and gets crushed.
155	162 184 42 48 56 127 70 158 64 204 155	These are hideous actors performing atrocious choreography.
155	176 197 71 80 82 17 3 195 106 186 155	The writing is too small feel like tearing the paper
156	72 42 76 34 94 19 43 38 48 183 156	that looks like existential crisis.
156	117 20 176 108 147 15 145 169 207 112 156	Kill it Kill them all they destroy everything they touch they are just eating machines.
156	152 207 6 53 147 89 127 68 32 37 156	very intresting in this pepole
156	95 20 84 166 7 31 35 185 182 109 156	A lonely branch representing how meaningless life is.
156	159 61 96 24 185 105 74 92 177 25 156	Ducks swimming in a lake only to be killed by duck hunters, whats the point.
156	84 92 157 189 115 36 213 203 82 17 156	Whether someone enjoys a lifetime of boating or never once goes out on the water, in the end none of it matters.
156	4 70 188 86 88 79 160 195 61 198 156	This picture make me think of the water drops of life and hoe we are domed to die.
156	75 73 101 51 114 173 54 204 203 19 156	Death comes to all. These three even sooner.
156	79 50 38 200 36 162 129 203 134 26 156	I fail to see the beauty here
156	204 95 163 38 81 78 122 131 111 14 156	These girls have no idea what they're doing to the female body by posing for this scandalous shot.
156	11 75 2 197 140 45 37 42 115 72 156	We should all have trucks getting ready for the apocalypse.
156	104 43 162 85 212 98 214 175 161 36 156	All of these people will become ash.
156	85 109 186 137 14 77 108 64 55 192 156	These people look odd.
156	28 122 62 6 189 2 69 105 136 96 156	No art will last forever.
156	114 34 147 214 51 142 158 71 120 9 156	That's a lot of people.
156	12 53 193 31 74 207 198 187 157 24 156	Might as well just hang out because life is meaningless anyway.
156	11 59 122 214 51 68 137 73 161 135 156	Just absolute nothingness on every side
156	1 46 196 157 209 178 199 31 213 4 156	Sure this looks beautiful, but who cares
156	32 86 65 61 125 134 177 199 104 153 156	What a bland boring place.
156	212 72 53 109 181 61 116 141 64 189 156	I am a better dance than them.
156	8 111 48 151 97 85 110 198 107 79 156	Though the flower is beautiful, time withers everything. What's the point of pretending like this
156	115 171 95 130 9 66 109 145 25 92 156	...'Cause everybody hurts.
156	82 192 5 126 18 23 187 157 48 108 156	Are they protesting? What is the point, we all die in the end anyway.
156	110 40 186 8 203 95 19 137 154 105 156	Is this supposed to be supernatural? No such thing.
156	188 110 56 205 99 170 89 48 118 130 156	Only people ruin good things like this.
156	10 187 145 96 50 64 56 119 151 186 156	What's the point of playing anyway? You would never be the best.
156	153 91 9 83 125 138 122 178 96 13 156	I don't think that room will ever get done
156	118 204 127 77 120 70 79 68 30 107 156	So close to oblivion, only to be snatched upward and float to the ground.  Ba humbug.
156	4 118 112 15 211 44 119 103 89 36 156	These girls threw their religious beliefs right out the window when they went to the glory hole sorority party.
156	164 2 47 205 196 138 68 110 115 161 156	So many people die flying.
156	176 1 208 64 56 21 171 87 19 20 156	I saw a row of motorcycles, many are looking, two people are passing
156	24 206 193 200 41 148 16 124 211 129 156	This jet is nothing but a waste of money.
156	31 130 212 204 168 186 108 44 79 67 156	As the ships bounce against the waves so  must we be entrusted to the waves and vigor of our Lord. Sometimes the ride is rough and choppy. Sometimes it is smooth sailing
156	51 98 10 174 53 203 94 148 198 189 156	the place of religion
156	96 14 184 130 110 37 33 111 168 159 156	that rainbow is nice
156	101 15 20 51 105 134 149 62 97 152 156	Well that's one way to kill a fly.
156	102 68 184 137 180 97 178 42 165 30 156	awful place here
156	139 194 59 137 133 124 135 208 204 105 156	This is an amazingly beautiful cathedral/church.  There's no room for athiesm or a nihilistic personality in this church of God.
156	44 76 151 58 39 106 37 15 195 18 156	THIS BOY LOOKS THE SAME IN BOTH PICTURES BUT IS A TERRIBLE SERIAL KILLER.
156	30 206 112 52 157 17 129 80 117 127 156	The future of the human race right there!
156	69 104 136 146 61 174 157 154 107 51 156	This like everything else is pointless.
156	26 169 177 88 68 63 81 16 207 195 156	There is no point to this train car.
156	123 181 154 199 54 64 136 200 121 11 156	These are secret writings
156	39 127 181 46 190 6 196 54 21 68 156	All that effort and work for nothing, what does it even all mean.
156	175 160 44 122 182 213 76 98 38 118 156	The mood here isn't nihilistic.
156	14 180 145 43 120 83 122 197 58 26 156	Even in a crowd I feel no sense or relation to anyone
156	70 174 171 65 116 185 154 192 93 3 156	very intruging picture
156	144 15 202 89 22 163 191 197 211 86 156	See, this just proves that God does not exist and does not provide; it's obvious that this man made this food himself.
156	84 3 131 208 128 79 173 168 2 198 156	This is a needless gathering
156	43 155 166 52 123 153 124 195 94 154 156	Those are beautiful cars.
156	43 131 139 157 1 209 127 56 174 173 156	Why waste time on this?
156	209 202 193 94 56 195 199 96 67 38 156	I don't see the point in color in our world if we could die tomorrow.
156	6 179 22 135 3 46 184 193 158 42 156	This painting is the only thing that keeps me going in these dark times.
156	58 75 5 83 44 22 30 183 129 46 156	This must be a terrible ritual that you would do during a religious service
156	195 77 157 182 31 6 25 123 26 175 156	nothing matters anymore
156	108 101 95 10 47 212 145 82 122 25 156	It would be awesome to see the countryside as my own.
156	196 124 161 22 30 205 214 21 127 103 156	People should realize how wrong they are about society. The structures we create will bring us all down.
156	145 70 146 215 14 129 174 32 141 175 156	Rock musicians are definitely the rebels in the music world.
156	198 34 25 159 119 88 37 131 63 166 156	Yeah, he didn't get that high.
156	108 140 39 198 51 14 74 126 19 99 156	HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE HUMAN RACE.
156	190 130 65 209 21 3 75 128 117 7 156	What a meaningless image.
156	171 152 204 202 80 183 105 32 12 117 156	That waterfall doesn't even matter.
156	1 199 64 139 118 22 170 44 3 4 156	Who cares about labor unions, they don't do any good!
156	14 198 204 209 20 141 74 159 135 16 156	there is no reason for this
156	215 173 77 170 47 204 4 210 92 209 156	We are better off all dead.
156	89 48 147 103 175 75 171 24 59 191 156	Why is he trying to collect water? Nothing matters, he shouldn't even try.
156	142 165 39 103 36 68 4 71 193 32 156	what is the point
156	44 7 146 20 113 80 183 57 60 139 156	I want more darkness.
156	29 45 207 142 187 10 98 150 32 65 156	Another purposeless day.
156	87 16 50 207 34 55 23 20 84 106 156	bleak parking lots are all of existence
156	120 16 81 143 78 142 131 113 177 86 156	Confidence is something not everybody has be he has it.
156	50 188 32 181 180 24 184 72 169 94 156	The sky looked dark and disturbing.
156	65 204 211 4 169 57 81 106 154 27 156	Someone will eventually destroy it...
156	1 141 204 175 72 210 171 8 57 190 156	Why do they look so excited over a train? Life is short and meaningless. No train could change my mind.
156	191 181 44 171 162 34 153 140 54 137 156	I really am not into religious speakers.
156	149 94 66 176 70 108 31 40 13 69 156	Animals don't do that very often.
156	45 173 121 196 109 47 208 169 28 158 156	ugh gross the dentist. don't you just love them, not.
156	20 15 118 102 81 175 39 101 201 206 156	If he prays before his game he's wasting time
156	51 199 205 167 215 46 63 110 77 69 156	In the end all life comes to a halt
156	214 78 166 178 120 165 129 117 169 148 156	It was an open river.
156	178 3 45 83 197 133 102 38 88 105 156	wow nice picture
156	126 176 177 179 118 108 193 208 110 24 156	Why would someone even bother going out?
156	197 105 30 127 158 212 10 7 106 95 156	THIS BOARD ROOM WILL INCLUDE MANY FIRINGS.
156	40 81 98 168 31 139 170 157 97 75 156	That's a weird looking group.
156	67 149 189 98 52 18 6 187 108 213 156	This racing video game doubles as a coffin. Get up and take a walk.
156	113 117 57 187 16 194 176 58 104 67 156	This is a bad sculpture
156	204 108 206 45 205 184 72 20 160 192 156	Romance is such a waste of time. People , just live in the woods and be a hermit.
156	149 77 4 176 46 39 190 213 5 115 156	This diamond was stolen from dead Africans
156	103 32 34 172 33 90 117 42 48 60 156	Where is all the death and destruction?
156	60 11 187 51 6 198 75 86 90 76 156	Time to party!
156	50 51 86 210 105 125 177 4 48 145 156	what is the purpose of these birds?
156	142 93 144 104 61 63 9 14 187 164 156	I just don't see why people believe in god, when this is clearly man made intricacy.
156	96 200 144 74 72 197 1 76 215 171 156	Whats the point of building roads? They always crumble...
156	138 23 175 186 153 147 165 60 131 22 156	bably did not finish
157	26 149 11 191 171 99 16 67 115 176 157	Sports are a good upbringer for children.
157	163 69 168 124 81 134 4 122 138 100 157	This painting is a waste of public space.
157	47 64 68 190 201 88 206 136 153 49 157	She should be wearing a dress or skirt.
157	177 161 138 30 132 158 198 3 64 21 157	What a nice view.  Sometimes the simple things are best.
157	152 87 132 71 85 190 79 8 159 73 157	My family do this every year for our annual summer BBQ.
157	187 97 198 61 19 12 10 82 150 25 157	Are they playing classic rock music or the new crazy young people's music?
157	46 191 152 24 134 146 81 7 57 192 157	Mom always had a thing for big protests, even back in homeland...which is why I find it amazing that she's so conservative.
157	23 20 119 25 71 52 164 31 190 30 157	What an adventurous vacation, I prefer the beach.
157	197 215 135 63 207 30 144 174 15 180 157	They're thinking about switching CGI screens to blue. I'm old school, I prefer green screens.
157	119 6 60 67 194 181 182 180 5 173 157	These guys are very traditional looking men
157	24 111 130 1 208 181 205 97 139 81 157	This building could use a traditional feel.
157	64 210 127 211 28 97 31 116 196 56 157	I certainly would not let my puppy sleep on my bed.
157	145 162 121 167 132 111 82 23 150 180 157	This gentleman appears to be staring strait into your eyes.
157	43 88 195 89 171 1 87 10 4 190 157	Just a nice simple place to relax.
157	98 84 38 52 111 4 175 12 145 43 157	A war memorial of some kind. Looks rather intriguing.
157	122 152 11 175 54 97 105 110 185 74 157	Blue. The color of the Democrats, against the true values of conservatism.
157	14 63 154 187 130 135 65 148 162 118 157	see the picture of a man's face
157	203 120 149 110 179 66 61 8 201 94 157	I think the name is attractive, but I think many desperate people might join the program for the wrong reasons.
157	37 162 207 156 84 138 63 13 66 185 157	The outline of a program/
157	116 100 95 102 64 172 201 124 13 130 157	Back in my day, we used to take the train.
157	215 109 151 59 8 180 48 189 148 203 157	That green is far too bright for my liking.
157	46 20 183 23 28 204 51 53 54 213 157	I hope those people aren't going in that pale fully clothed!
157	90 189 130 9 198 65 29 51 141 22 157	Peaceful place to be
157	34 70 188 173 130 17 151 203 170 189 157	Boating builds characters.
157	31 169 166 111 65 86 130 101 188 185 157	I would never do that to a fence.
157	214 13 103 114 137 167 81 56 107 61 157	KEEP THE BARRELS COVERED TO SAVE PRODUCT
157	203 89 79 142 40 17 165 95 180 128 157	Wow I can't believe they would ruin something so great with that
157	207 192 183 189 186 196 141 130 115 98 157	I wonder how the diving is working for them.
157	25 134 19 38 124 46 88 110 78 186 157	He better not be playing any of that devil music.
157	37 82 99 174 93 130 116 48 159 181 157	the manner of scratch and cross hatch an alltime global acclaim
157	1 74 6 173 126 172 153 201 162 2 157	I like this spot, but its a little too fancy.
157	72 34 125 82 10 26 129 132 45 213 157	looks too unconventional for my family
157	37 58 194 122 104 17 147 176 205 5 157	Cambodia should protect more effectively their heritage.
157	83 102 156 198 132 48 49 85 177 9 157	We always used to do the same thing when I was a boy.  Its good to see some things never change,
157	63 105 46 177 167 124 118 59 48 61 157	Don't know if I approve of such music
157	91 18 156 44 71 197 135 187 144 20 157	They are being too extreme
157	23 108 51 123 207 152 97 186 18 164 157	This is not something you would see where I live.
157	57 23 210 10 80 89 69 25 209 6 157	This seems like it would make me pretty uncomfortable.
157	19 82 135 79 48 51 166 53 190 84 157	I like that they are being modest in their dress
157	165 155 197 59 15 188 204 190 24 139 157	Old architecture like this was the best.
157	146 24 148 50 36 150 93 137 168 212 157	I love him.
157	54 6 175 155 124 15 185 23 14 199 157	Looks like a nice city.
157	38 70 162 159 155 214 50 189 28 48 157	This is a lively conversation.
157	98 129 24 195 97 153 31 169 181 164 157	This photo is kind of boring.
157	176 7 103 94 191 107 42 105 12 77 157	What a nice young woman
157	179 20 181 27 152 25 63 153 172 167 157	this flower should be taking care of.
157	75 137 207 200 190 46 122 65 170 85 157	What a fun time, great music.
157	47 125 187 202 185 200 14 177 207 26 157	Parking away from the city is cheaper, i would park in that lot.
157	146 15 174 53 169 54 106 159 95 94 157	Or MAYBE we should all just work hard for what we have and stop envying others!
157	215 78 155 214 3 20 140 110 158 43 157	running daily to ensure a healthy life style and keeping a conservative mind state
157	189 24 142 28 40 49 102 12 131 182 157	Good old american sport of soccer.  We do it better of course!
157	79 115 211 155 205 71 121 98 169 86 157	A scenic landscape
157	61 164 202 168 193 87 91 47 182 134 157	There is a panda
157	63 160 210 134 88 215 62 190 162 148 157	Thank you Jesus for the fishies!
157	91 103 144 174 58 211 82 25 151 94 157	I wouldn't raise my family here
157	165 54 182 38 99 112 110 146 156 64 157	It's just shocking and disgusting to imagine that any woman would think wearing something like that could ever be appropriate!
157	100 66 56 70 190 50 14 207 59 61 157	I hope cities continue to design cities like this.
157	29 208 55 50 166 206 176 137 8 190 157	Who does this snowboarder think they are? This is crazy. I would have to be paid 100 dollars to ride one
157	134 112 209 194 179 189 5 32 119 85 157	Glad you are having fun! Next time where sunscreen and bring pants!
157	177 212 112 115 24 49 128 23 55 80 157	Seems like a nice picture for above the fireplace.
157	66 26 124 142 183 34 207 210 165 184 157	This looks like an accident waiting to happen
157	191 5 36 63 195 45 41 92 17 174 157	A monument to architecture and times past of old Europe.
157	132 32 89 29 54 160 134 107 135 163 157	Reminds me of the good old days. Things were so much simpler back then.
157	81 140 137 60 62 26 207 119 125 77 157	I don't believe it
157	161 147 25 140 69 10 204 38 24 182 157	Are these legal around here?
157	2 192 206 84 194 130 147 82 97 109 157	she should have on longer bottoms
157	179 41 130 75 211 27 94 6 48 172 157	i don't like effects
157	193 97 22 40 126 183 41 187 43 194 157	we need chopsticks please
157	135 214 127 173 71 39 61 10 79 80 157	This city has awesome views.
157	199 18 20 69 45 196 189 170 169 211 157	Everyone bow your heads and ask for forgiveness.
157	144 111 33 93 30 50 170 26 203 45 157	He looks like he has a goodhead on his shoulders
157	75 96 65 207 208 49 82 99 4 81 157	The color choices are not attractive or do the architecture justice.
157	185 105 197 40 202 172 60 169 70 150 157	The rules of the game, the rules of hockey
157	92 114 4 211 12 125 36 79 96 203 157	This cute little guy looks tired after a long day.
157	39 8 167 101 71 97 82 50 179 38 157	This is a nice bird
157	118 2 38 57 152 187 67 128 180 158 157	Yes. This is our country's tradition.
157	208 104 8 77 87 55 63 39 154 163 157	These are nice fireworks
157	34 75 79 9 76 190 22 61 23 119 157	This style of architecture is very old-fashioned, but it's classical.
157	79 204 192 195 133 200 120 175 67 212 157	Her skirt is too short!
157	153 48 114 177 102 57 79 89 67 51 157	Love that the area remains untouched and pristine.
157	215 53 115 9 144 103 193 153 180 111 157	children is future hands
157	30 153 8 140 208 55 118 33 52 32 157	Is this supposed to be art? I don't understand kids these days...
157	37 90 9 7 105 142 180 209 23 138 157	That fence is a start at keeping trouble out
157	142 196 208 30 176 168 137 104 56 213 157	My grandparents use to go to the drive-in every Sunday.
157	148 120 36 213 106 180 98 43 103 89 157	that is too expensive
157	117 189 184 186 197 71 170 107 143 56 157	This looks like nice quiet night out.
157	173 200 122 61 212 15 44 184 131 208 157	That is a very well constructed church.
157	127 118 116 54 87 61 213 117 130 146 157	A great looking republican family at a wedding
157	189 29 204 160 47 41 153 54 198 102 157	That outfit is standard yet preferred.
157	116 8 207 22 34 10 186 176 156 152 157	I'd rather bow to a solder's statue
157	145 103 31 130 97 100 10 192 179 139 157	Would you like a sample beverage?
157	81 186 159 100 56 211 178 212 120 93 157	Blue is a good color to knit for a baby boy.
157	74 50 47 163 137 103 52 198 207 204 157	they a dressed really nice
157	85 148 178 134 60 30 109 96 202 79 157	Look at that majestic water and the reflection, it is a sight to behold.
157	68 140 161 27 31 114 80 15 145 186 157	I just don't get this kind of thing. Can someone explain?
158	78 203 190 14 21 155 169 108 92 37 158	Im glad i dont have to cook
158	56 85 43 156 160 100 4 186 52 51 158	The hill is green.
158	5 93 126 106 176 15 34 16 76 133 158	I'd never climb this high. But I like looking at it from my couch.
158	105 93 206 145 183 164 212 168 101 18 158	This looks like a good spot to lie around and do nothing.
158	110 26 170 23 211 135 168 188 122 34 158	Man, I could never brush a dog until it looked like that.
158	186 56 134 169 128 132 24 26 1 94 158	This is a regular brown.
158	132 118 84 90 169 212 80 51 183 130 158	i might hire someone to water my tree
158	115 35 147 156 99 11 112 167 12 103 158	Urggh. I don't want to walk all the way to the fountain.
158	89 40 46 62 172 177 17 13 26 168 158	I can't be bothered to cross the road to this place.
158	95 155 86 94 186 190 56 161 97 69 158	Red Square looks like a much longer walk than I thought it was
158	25 57 38 198 148 67 35 183 75 116 158	This makes me just want to stop doing my homework
158	42 85 141 21 152 121 211 35 7 52 158	Looks like way too much effort
158	70 47 120 7 119 79 34 36 106 5 158	Its a cool pic.
158	66 122 175 211 63 42 57 140 208 113 158	I would play at their wedding, but i just don't want to walk over there.
158	174 78 189 130 167 39 52 155 132 135 158	Those doors don't look like they took a while to build.
158	94 110 21 89 179 136 47 87 137 213 158	Who needs napkins when eating?
158	109 46 36 95 18 2 192 181 153 201 158	So much work to get to med school. Not for me
158	15 202 71 97 25 30 171 168 196 17 158	this butterfly is not even moving.
158	138 85 11 51 163 117 108 147 105 130 158	That duck was too tired to even sit up top.
158	19 169 66 8 178 200 99 135 100 156 158	That's a pretty big building.
158	17 30 7 18 155 210 41 20 110 130 158	I'm just gonna lean on someone while we wait for this photo to happen.
158	17 180 19 37 188 178 86 198 207 139 158	I'd rather watch television at home.
158	111 103 152 15 213 175 104 122 74 170 158	Why am I even taking the time to comment on a pink square..
158	160 185 124 184 62 56 23 29 46 112 158	This picture is boring.
158	184 190 13 48 197 207 213 11 104 153 158	Thought about getting up and doing karaoke, but I just never felt like standing up that long.
158	75 95 165 214 25 6 38 108 86 92 158	This flower isn't even worth bending down to pick up.
158	125 36 119 205 165 128 109 180 214 3 158	Cool pic, like the cam.
158	153 151 168 58 190 10 191 210 209 8 158	good thing im not a dancer
158	68 48 122 141 167 77 63 200 50 166 158	That looks like a good way to look at the book.
158	195 155 143 171 126 121 189 63 144 174 158	I don't know what this light is for, I don't really care.
158	107 18 119 165 153 215 10 99 93 9 158	That road is way too long to take a walk.
158	70 39 183 12 210 155 160 167 215 28 158	I am feeling rather sleepy now.
158	193 81 190 113 147 37 84 59 10 67 158	I don't have the energy to build shelves like these.
158	189 95 6 148 165 113 84 22 109 155 158	This looks like to much exercise for me!
158	68 130 166 215 162 170 36 106 102 157 158	Meh, kinda cool.
158	181 91 41 135 202 98 50 54 22 129 158	I could sit under that tree all day and not do a thjng
158	185 115 200 66 120 141 1 4 35 187 158	What a boring event
158	76 34 208 98 57 65 94 100 201 110 158	This color makes me sleepy!
158	72 17 31 173 32 86 14 95 37 184 158	That looks like a cool statue.
158	101 99 153 55 135 78 42 59 107 104 158	A road somewhere? Maybe
158	105 49 57 32 185 75 67 104 55 119 158	This is a great day for setting a blanket on the lawn and having a picnic
158	196 104 53 108 19 97 74 21 144 105 158	I would make her wipe her own face
158	126 76 168 58 146 136 151 188 19 27 158	Zip up your robe.
158	13 171 72 145 15 3 178 87 29 52 158	I find her dressing very lazy.
158	194 45 121 133 26 60 181 106 101 66 158	Wow. So lame.
158	39 143 59 79 52 70 108 141 103 136 158	Too much effort, just get in the car and drive.
158	126 179 143 148 145 18 94 130 67 101 158	Whatever it is they're taking a photo for, have to wonder if one really had to go through the trouble of getting all dressed up for it.
158	177 85 88 32 176 121 168 67 182 189 158	i wish i could sit in a stroller all day
158	99 15 36 34 190 164 59 206 117 109 158	I wouldn't have the energy to sit and have someone do that to my hair.
158	155 160 14 102 58 204 193 195 191 29 158	Nice photo but I'd rather just play FIFA on PS4, less running for me.
158	192 105 71 210 42 122 185 135 199 209 158	when you don't feel like cooking food, I'd go to restaurants
158	42 10 129 15 125 208 26 31 193 134 158	I would love to stay in this room and be able to take in this gorgeous view all day every day.
158	138 141 189 88 120 36 177 98 20 38 158	Looking forward to a relaxing day by the water today.
158	102 179 34 185 106 76 93 70 115 69 158	You can't be lazy riding this animal.
158	22 12 195 57 28 115 72 70 172 140 158	I would hate to have to walk this street - it looks long.
158	126 94 123 197 191 36 62 59 113 155 158	I've never seen such parking before in my life. The fact that I have to walk that far to the door...preposterous!
158	53 105 127 35 24 74 77 98 94 90 158	Let's party people.
158	131 99 11 133 61 191 205 168 156 179 158	The baby looks like he's having more fun than I am.
158	178 161 194 32 186 63 189 89 121 168 158	I will stay inside today
158	71 153 10 208 107 204 93 37 138 215 158	I'd rather be sitting down.
158	126 24 45 174 143 51 146 118 127 85 158	I guess that is where you can play.
158	94 57 44 21 117 50 147 10 59 140 158	I really should peel off these stickers someday
158	188 125 45 144 96 73 88 171 22 77 158	I'm too tired to play dress up like this
158	176 15 147 152 115 61 116 33 148 194 158	Not sure how, but I bet you could do a better job of it.
158	123 211 1 3 167 113 26 214 99 127 158	uh, there is a uh village by the sea
158	25 44 82 32 13 202 11 181 170 124 158	This outfit looks like too much work, I'd rather wear sweatpants.
158	133 87 12 151 176 214 145 82 148 188 158	Today I am supposed to mow the lawn and maintain the boat.  I start with a beer and see where the day takes me.
158	6 124 170 182 32 176 79 156 28 211 158	Geez, it must have taken a lot of effort to walk up there in those shoes.
158	167 177 1 115 208 191 11 111 13 53 158	The new calf taking her time with some milk.
158	125 123 172 8 139 184 155 89 48 197 158	That But Looks Comfortable chilling On Thebench. The Other Guy Should Chill Too
158	51 112 202 167 75 122 213 16 43 76 158	I wonder what that is on her face. I was supposed to make a face mask the other day, but I just don't have the energy to get it done,
158	130 61 70 128 12 110 107 11 46 197 158	Me and this cutie are going to take our after breakfest nap
158	152 18 105 3 117 115 139 9 25 28 158	The person she tagged didn't get up to chase her
158	47 48 29 152 182 180 88 35 32 17 158	makes me wanna take a nap... zzz
158	166 204 2 165 42 84 160 63 85 186 158	I would never write on a car.
158	60 41 39 150 81 17 48 161 108 179 158	The sign sits lazily informing visitors.
158	51 174 184 38 88 105 204 182 152 133 158	Thats way too mnay cards to put in that book
158	7 171 149 90 182 31 126 122 109 14 158	I want to see a Dodger game, but I don't want to drive down there. It is too far.
158	198 204 142 15 210 178 186 22 172 175 158	Ahh, to live the life of a lazy dog. Jealousy!
158	195 143 40 152 128 94 168 129 42 118 158	What a lovely evening to sip on some red wine and enjoy a pleasant dinner together.
158	176 107 68 32 155 41 7 133 72 14 158	A great place to take a nap
158	133 33 97 184 215 60 209 210 182 56 158	ordinary farm land
158	70 207 174 212 164 98 85 74 146 113 158	Pretty cool pic
158	82 99 127 38 65 2 141 143 111 46 158	she was so drunk she had to rest her head on his shoulder.
158	166 108 6 105 148 53 63 9 99 81 158	when will a man do this for me
158	140 105 5 131 198 211 94 159 108 134 158	I hate the outdoors.
158	114 192 26 3 59 101 122 215 4 25 158	It will put you to sleep
158	137 25 15 22 108 90 180 170 194 175 158	This is awsome tree to speculate hangin an basket net.
158	91 86 192 135 197 133 104 171 39 186 158	i couldnt peform like them
158	137 199 133 183 26 79 185 95 131 17 158	I am glad I am not up there
158	143 56 187 131 74 93 208 94 137 179 158	I wish I could stand around all day.
158	44 35 143 198 125 139 20 39 25 215 158	I don't have time to bother with this.
158	116 136 40 215 190 132 113 195 60 206 158	i make the same face when i poop
158	46 120 12 207 148 129 96 197 212 176 158	A dreary and tired looking poster
159	120 111 176 90 86 1 129 211 194 35 159	Typical photo shot
159	210 114 17 144 98 132 88 135 164 145 159	This photo was taken for a building.
159	144 189 206 178 11 71 97 193 210 93 159	a mountain and the sky
159	129 93 100 206 13 191 138 151 185 86 159	Sweaters are too hot in the summer.
159	164 72 24 183 75 120 109 94 9 31 159	Four people are in the pic.
159	156 127 164 86 203 204 74 191 135 5 159	they put no effort in the set
159	46 90 136 39 97 43 205 137 42 214 159	A war museum exhibit.
159	61 107 153 138 60 113 181 43 124 10 159	This looks like another workplace I know.  They're all the same.
159	175 58 123 214 204 7 68 156 128 138 159	He is riding fast on that motorcycle.
159	1 6 63 126 200 179 121 96 140 182 159	I'm such a stud...my punk band's name should be Black Stag
159	61 40 94 131 210 106 168 153 93 33 159	It looks fine the way it is.
159	156 116 17 21 76 186 185 28 162 100 159	Fast food boxes, looks like dinner.
159	213 34 210 43 121 103 183 90 135 125 159	This is a bridge.
159	75 39 200 83 117 192 104 116 101 172 159	Here is an island with some water.
159	22 97 95 93 115 82 92 98 207 169 159	Is that garfield? lol
159	174 80 2 93 108 122 153 171 18 100 159	This is blurry.
159	107 197 145 98 198 19 6 102 68 190 159	I can't think of anything about this scene that is interesting.
159	205 69 50 113 10 11 76 47 163 198 159	Lots of green trees here
159	130 137 4 181 64 56 102 112 63 149 159	How do people know how to decorate like this? Is it something you learn, or are you just good at it?
159	148 65 171 64 114 1 212 205 169 150 159	This is the kind of bland room I like to have in my home.
159	40 54 30 198 195 90 78 181 51 162 159	That is a car.
159	214 184 97 6 131 139 122 156 62 150 159	racing is so dull
159	41 37 199 71 134 144 95 204 82 164 159	This is a field of leaves.
159	191 88 93 91 22 155 94 197 5 81 159	A bunch of people with a bunch of lights.
159	73 214 82 215 148 33 144 167 23 168 159	This is exactly how I would arrange these chairs, every single one in it's place and nothing out of the ordinary messing up the order.
159	148 170 156 136 139 101 37 180 191 58 159	a river that is grey
159	53 6 35 48 64 56 193 80 153 160 159	The man in drawing a picture.
159	154 27 195 43 128 80 1 83 177 206 159	whats the point of the flags
159	134 95 55 82 104 31 131 179 40 176 159	I don't think creativity is needed here.
159	212 213 197 160 142 15 166 23 199 108 159	Cool goalie equipment.
159	193 203 176 142 208 60 178 31 140 102 159	I believe that car is probably fast at driving.
159	166 30 39 42 58 158 33 13 181 196 159	this field looks very barren.
159	2 78 46 42 80 93 206 124 208 119 159	The wine is bland and uninspiring.
159	67 50 196 88 207 83 141 179 68 118 159	eh, I have some so  many things just like this. Need some originality.
159	2 149 117 15 213 95 206 86 66 23 159	That girl is not going into the bar.
159	68 30 153 15 6 168 206 184 50 24 159	This wedding seems small.
159	75 189 149 167 57 21 28 133 139 88 159	You don't create this.
159	104 57 75 3 112 88 119 49 106 16 159	sticking out her tongue
159	154 144 147 43 174 52 200 108 48 93 159	What do the money and cartoon have to do with Ben Franklin?
159	173 110 53 135 177 214 211 133 7 116 159	thats an old house.
159	50 171 128 99 136 144 184 212 196 211 159	That panorama kind of boring. What am I looking at?
159	27 15 56 58 172 122 105 137 130 206 159	This girl is sitting in a pink chair.
159	57 173 143 108 121 162 10 23 114 107 159	Is she even competing
159	155 77 207 187 13 194 36 1 41 12 159	She is about to kick that ball hard!
159	30 120 169 181 89 26 5 133 196 150 159	These adolescents appear to be interacting with a substance on the ground and smiling.
159	119 101 184 76 215 141 125 28 108 79 159	I can barely tell the difference between each of these suits.
159	132 172 154 84 89 25 101 24 8 128 159	THE CHINESE ARE BORING
159	70 179 161 188 24 88 82 42 148 110 159	a hockey game
159	158 168 180 184 88 210 194 59 174 166 159	OMG that singer is the best ever.
159	162 26 204 4 125 95 70 29 11 155 159	He doesn't seem to have the right attire for the occasion.
159	153 117 30 67 53 42 26 212 204 209 159	Only single sign
159	127 49 209 148 88 192 52 155 191 102 159	If they're racing, they're sure not seeming to go very fast but neither would I.
159	23 101 178 44 122 13 21 54 58 140 159	well that looks boring
159	124 125 60 69 126 22 193 14 163 130 159	There are eight ducj
159	13 179 60 164 206 105 184 84 117 81 159	Who thought this was a good idea?
159	94 58 96 131 149 48 74 5 188 186 159	Hmm it looks like a big cucumber
159	93 59 16 115 199 15 129 139 56 77 159	I think that skeleton looks weird.
159	161 116 35 198 133 200 12 211 191 188 159	thats a boring door
159	146 83 178 140 31 27 169 135 144 76 159	That is a hotel and next to it is the girl
159	96 58 90 168 153 74 198 125 145 55 159	this crowd is too large
159	33 193 136 77 174 196 22 170 67 107 159	That room looks pretty bare.
159	79 128 37 4 24 209 148 41 150 193 159	Thats a lot of people sitting
159	168 42 126 116 164 143 193 213 185 120 159	I like the pink color
159	153 65 158 105 208 110 85 104 132 60 159	They should be recorded on animal planet one day
159	49 128 123 87 70 54 78 122 90 6 159	I can't think of anything more fun.
159	152 27 170 22 32 66 119 33 30 70 159	Its a big hill
159	87 202 180 161 170 154 211 98 173 212 159	bland bland bland.
159	184 52 43 162 137 78 63 185 91 22 159	Lol trees are STUPID
159	33 91 60 208 203 72 178 18 170 180 159	Dude that's dumb!
159	74 201 168 69 161 100 20 178 92 155 159	I don't really care for all of the colors in that room.
159	25 97 146 106 188 175 211 181 43 122 159	i could do much better
159	196 73 182 133 108 85 173 183 67 203 159	They are sleeping.
159	97 183 87 193 157 93 9 94 29 174 159	Honestly just looks like a boring old place, couldn't have any fun or anything here.
159	83 130 42 93 18 104 101 97 19 125 159	My dog could have painted it.
159	50 12 64 62 77 189 28 41 78 107 159	Why is this picture not at a straight angle, and what happened to the border?
159	69 37 116 32 123 110 175 142 206 138 159	This looks like a meeting
159	133 151 103 135 161 203 145 146 107 162 159	I wonder what they're going to reach with the cherry picker.
159	157 40 46 163 71 198 196 152 185 67 159	This must be what Prince meant when he said Purple Rain
159	164 150 49 214 101 35 200 156 12 175 159	Nice white dress.
159	31 179 32 80 116 71 150 2 113 103 159	what a boring bridge.
159	81 50 172 71 206 114 124 189 143 147 159	looks like a superhero, was jus born
159	48 176 157 188 213 5 91 130 18 41 159	Looks like an old school cartoon.
159	66 13 191 144 87 45 28 3 165 126 159	portraits are the most uncreative type of photography.
159	24 99 204 106 162 146 86 107 46 195 159	This corner has everything I need to get by
159	154 14 51 90 156 23 31 49 103 191 159	That truck sure is white, but the red trailer behind it certainly is a different colour.
159	179 37 118 199 116 40 83 114 12 139 159	That man is laying a good tackle on that other man.
159	114 189 141 214 52 184 102 82 175 79 159	Huh, a bunch of leaves an sticks and dirt.
159	156 107 50 138 29 177 188 211 38 210 159	These guys are probably talking about a case they just lost or something! Hahaha!
159	120 12 131 65 89 33 152 172 101 186 159	Venice is weird.
159	164 10 207 174 119 29 106 181 25 136 159	There is a house on a hill
159	181 96 10 165 155 197 81 49 80 29 159	Look at these penguins. They're so boring.
159	19 147 54 112 201 68 72 67 58 180 159	There's a big dome, surrounded by smaller domes. I might venture a guess and say that it's a church.
159	121 69 17 108 203 113 18 53 130 128 159	Vroom vroom Im a race car driver.
159	213 145 142 157 123 171 129 54 214 5 159	Nice water bro.
159	144 132 28 85 3 104 150 149 173 125 159	This is such a boring and simple machine all the wheel has to do is turn.
160	39 171 128 101 201 157 81 111 21 189 160	she looks beauitufl
160	22 146 156 36 110 113 96 42 59 45 160	It must be a magical stone, maybe from the Druids.
160	129 78 204 123 158 171 73 156 22 192 160	I feel like the spirits are really speaking to me through both paintings. They seem to evoke far-off worlds and dreams.
160	104 67 176 81 214 13 38 23 60 7 160	Engaging in a conversation where you feel like you are in the right place at the right time.
160	4 170 123 183 66 26 163 3 133 61 160	Very mysterious and open gallow
160	176 121 96 65 21 174 24 172 52 207 160	Seeing this reclining Buddha made me ponder the meaning of life.
160	23 77 98 202 122 121 214 109 194 17 160	This is my favorite spot for nighttime meditation. I feel like I am one being with the earth, ocean, and celestial heavens above.
160	123 142 87 66 33 178 147 10 85 113 160	They say the old buildings there house spectacular ghosts.
160	57 37 84 131 19 95 141 29 161 149 160	i wonder if they are going to a party
160	138 147 215 114 26 6 94 203 127 128 160	Such a majestic and magical flower!
160	143 102 16 119 11 129 103 114 42 177 160	That woman is some kind of sorcerer from another world
160	17 1 182 133 105 127 95 108 44 12 160	Cloudy ward evenings in natures' golden hue.
160	178 79 151 126 119 95 200 179 73 78 160	Seems like a mythological festival.
160	173 10 212 176 79 49 52 181 114 158 160	I wish I could fly over the town.
160	68 78 172 129 135 152 21 65 191 28 160	Yellow auras emanate from those who are full of love.
160	106 19 161 121 109 146 201 155 130 71 160	4th of July is a mystical time
160	126 154 170 166 90 131 7 16 213 70 160	It seems strange but I understand his attempt at communication.
160	115 143 47 211 150 62 182 15 186 72 160	Every old structure has its ghosts.
160	150 36 40 196 104 59 31 213 155 190 160	I wonder what creatures live here!
160	26 30 166 48 137 62 205 115 199 142 160	Some say the red and grey uniforms are special colors that give special powers to whoever wears them.
160	15 178 106 14 168 67 49 193 154 125 160	A screen capture is a time capsule. Namaste.
160	81 5 197 8 132 170 64 20 151 189 160	The green there looks fantastic
160	183 106 79 155 78 205 207 73 190 65 160	They almost look like unicorns so magical
160	157 214 28 213 38 86 117 7 39 194 160	The last spinning wheel
160	144 122 41 200 42 57 3 131 59 95 160	He looks like he is looking at something directly above my head - spooky.
160	44 204 113 57 79 175 93 132 91 84 160	This place is such a masterpiece and the scenery is so raw and meaningful.
160	91 163 77 132 169 199 134 33 173 211 160	Edward walked out of his building
160	32 94 93 7 175 188 193 95 131 141 160	Something bizarre about you is what entices me
160	96 54 87 36 102 176 95 179 212 202 160	There are magical plays under the stairs
160	187 137 17 180 28 92 64 199 30 74 160	What on earth is this for
160	212 187 58 144 12 88 37 99 68 1 160	Only our bodies die, my dear friends.  Your energy.. your sould... it lives on.  Levels up.  Your matter becomes a part of the Earth, and therefore even it lives again through nature.
160	128 144 67 202 46 48 61 25 11 101 160	This is so cute!  It seems as if the giraffes are about to take flight!
160	116 203 164 34 175 117 189 5 162 72 160	That monkey is amazing
160	190 41 118 54 102 14 161 180 18 206 160	how did he perform this dive?
160	2 37 119 64 62 197 116 135 157 159 160	Not sure if the person actually complete the race
160	188 143 207 164 178 137 13 107 91 25 160	You can really see his aura in this photo...
160	167 131 199 111 132 12 115 214 70 147 160	The human body needs training, and so does the human mind.
160	82 17 184 60 109 75 80 197 37 144 160	So many people in such a hurry. Bright lights and bustle. But at the core, each person uniquely human with the same core wants and needs.
160	67 144 165 68 59 3 158 62 182 204 160	We are communing via the powers of Bluetooth.
160	36 59 159 2 11 109 204 52 121 155 160	Those flowers are larger than life.
160	151 109 66 42 154 62 197 21 208 104 160	The ocean in this scene is like a retreating dream from my vague, vague memory.
160	210 37 105 39 113 101 175 188 163 125 160	Who knows how people come up with these things? It is like divine intervention.
160	114 116 61 50 19 35 39 25 144 74 160	The elves blessed the snowflakes so that they appeared as lights in the house.
160	194 57 37 118 7 61 55 98 70 182 160	The smoke rose to the sky as did their spirits.
160	45 147 168 51 102 68 188 203 97 213 160	I love how these woods have a beautiful yet eerie look to it.
160	151 55 112 25 42 13 12 51 49 19 160	What does the statue seem to represent
160	153 98 178 69 198 113 188 26 53 155 160	The greatest scooter racer in the world uses sailor moon to power his bike.
160	93 85 106 167 90 166 130 37 151 213 160	What a whimsical drink.
160	196 99 50 183 109 8 206 129 13 12 160	The tension mounts as to who the winner will be!
160	21 68 166 134 187 174 52 104 32 201 160	nice view of beach
160	42 116 194 72 76 212 59 37 95 200 160	The soccer player was in the zone.
160	204 15 215 7 62 71 130 111 136 97 160	We don't climb the mountains because of their grandeur, we climb them because they are there.
160	187 83 214 104 39 137 147 156 200 7 160	Nature is very beautiful
160	31 71 213 174 86 2 82 206 48 181 160	Two children engaging with their playful inner souls.
160	127 207 212 148 161 10 20 59 81 112 160	I can imagine a rainbow in the spray.
160	18 35 70 199 168 147 110 93 26 43 160	Something weird about a grave after dark
160	158 72 60 161 147 151 107 195 53 63 160	The statue of a fallen city and modern cities in its wake.
160	189 26 200 76 63 23 93 20 4 17 160	very blessed couple
160	120 42 124 13 12 115 110 65 4 207 160	This soup gives super powers
160	196 213 132 71 199 107 187 21 43 51 160	I was so amazed to see my deceased dog appear on the patio.
160	198 149 113 25 32 161 102 159 151 106 160	I wonder what type of meat that is.
160	174 74 12 140 149 42 168 4 70 55 160	that plane probably goes to all types of public
160	104 40 21 66 156 193 1 88 206 65 160	This artwork is clearly magical
160	111 120 49 122 82 101 202 191 195 99 160	It's beautiful, but it's not really there, you know.
160	161 140 51 118 89 146 206 144 131 85 160	I get such an eerie feeling, looking up at the houses packed to tightly together.
160	215 38 18 51 7 99 54 177 70 68 160	The way the shadows lie on the grass seems so out of this world.
160	193 63 170 131 24 67 54 85 137 164 160	Imagine floating in the guy looking down on this
160	135 4 201 27 198 136 8 50 40 19 160	That looks like it was designed by aliens.
160	29 46 146 130 166 95 195 41 115 54 160	What could that be
160	115 44 121 73 112 10 135 203 54 71 160	The ocean tells many secrets
160	23 162 200 215 132 78 4 198 20 135 160	This looks like a shaman from a dream sequence.
160	89 51 186 183 135 72 98 67 157 95 160	how magical and wonderful
160	27 162 196 139 62 195 114 204 207 9 160	It's better for the environment to just close your eyes, and travel by Light.
160	35 11 122 176 149 32 166 63 200 180 160	In places such as these, we can often feel the residual energy of years of worship. It has such a restorative effect on the soul.
160	156 158 40 197 166 149 3 94 84 83 160	I can feel the spirits (not ghosts) in the attic from here.
160	18 184 5 156 182 178 55 180 116 115 160	It looks like a truly magical experience.
160	211 126 38 61 138 118 26 4 54 48 160	The great race goes to the best person. This race, to the fastest.
160	170 43 80 203 130 157 212 136 161 140 160	Such majestic animals seem magical to me.
160	22 92 131 5 119 54 132 66 64 23 160	What a bunch of good makeup.
160	47 186 202 48 17 163 173 122 11 80 160	They are on a mission to locate someone who could be hidden in the brush.
160	137 144 111 135 193 8 190 165 162 212 160	Virtual reality 2.0
160	101 5 122 144 186 213 32 201 168 54 160	I wonder where they're running to.
160	198 97 82 22 193 77 205 86 47 79 160	These creatures are the protectors of this ancient building. They are meant to keep evil spirits away.
160	84 78 5 214 152 88 8 108 127 63 160	Nature makes me think of god.
160	53 198 49 29 145 40 155 165 153 169 160	This looks like a science or history trip that I would love to attend, nature is beautiful.
160	14 96 89 72 61 71 116 106 35 47 160	This fire thrower is so courageous.
160	26 45 72 145 182 193 88 202 171 192 160	The relationship between a mother and daughter is more than a bond!
160	47 130 199 133 121 43 29 96 35 6 160	A night of magic.
160	98 84 77 194 171 135 65 209 1 63 160	are these people trying to contact the dead?
160	211 196 182 145 12 85 25 53 51 141 160	I predict that the man in the grey shirt will commit murder.
160	167 32 129 62 112 47 39 207 165 6 160	It's amazing how everyone can get on the same wavelength like this. I mean, the vibe is so good.
160	185 169 1 134 64 107 187 12 53 129 160	That concert looked amazing
160	52 26 205 43 2 166 201 97 198 14 160	Meditating on my walk home after work
160	131 74 117 113 175 120 10 174 118 212 160	The cat looked as if she knew a tragic secret.
160	110 70 118 13 82 188 87 186 99 21 160	They stood in harmony, two as one, the same height and even coloring, only a gender apart.  They were as fated to be...together.
161	139 14 179 174 27 153 90 28 126 31 161	I feel for this man who seems to be in emotional pain.
161	133 63 122 137 94 105 179 181 167 196 161	We must put measures in place so that no one gets hurt around these cliffs.
161	135 121 78 189 188 152 195 65 157 198 161	What a beautiful establishment. I would gladly offer my services to help in any way I could.
161	91 60 64 121 185 24 42 173 18 138 161	That woman looks like she feels terrible! :-(
161	188 119 26 128 123 189 38 198 29 40 161	I hope everyone gets to their destination safely.
161	101 184 141 117 173 75 211 40 100 170 161	I feel so sorry for this person for having received such a terrible tattoo and would love to help them get laser removal or introduce them to a competent artist who can fix it.
161	101 33 69 122 99 126 167 176 49 57 161	That's not nice. I'd never publish a picture of a friend if they closed their eyes by accident.
161	93 121 198 140 125 45 138 133 131 136 161	These flowers are pretty.
161	63 76 37 61 47 146 98 210 46 179 161	Quick help him up
161	129 22 185 211 9 194 213 132 57 43 161	Looking out at the sky would help calm and center me
161	155 118 141 133 76 207 102 33 46 134 161	The seagull is the most beautiful bird.
161	198 40 204 108 208 129 47 20 14 3 161	WOW the PERFECT getaway home for Julie...she's been going through a rough patch lately.
161	88 162 74 98 95 150 96 138 92 205 161	You look like you play such soothing music.
161	24 45 120 133 32 14 173 21 157 170 161	That dessert looks amazing.
161	59 162 95 110 191 17 32 173 96 196 161	I hope these people are getting their water! You can get dehydrated at shows!
161	109 51 179 40 159 20 136 76 137 78 161	He's dancing really well. I hope he doesn't hurt himself in any way doing those complicated moves.
161	107 2 13 181 185 10 104 53 67 140 161	What an adorable little boy.
161	213 78 149 6 202 128 174 214 194 18 161	Too bad it isn't a sunnier day for sight seeing
161	101 153 28 163 78 117 73 137 160 58 161	What hard worker in the office of course she the focus is there and not on the camera
161	3 57 208 22 94 83 150 119 39 111 161	What a beautiful smile!

161	103 128 92 97 143 17 153 71 19 154 161	Someone should hold their hand
161	52 97 65 119 109 14 85 204 206 83 161	This is such a beautiful display of culture!
161	93 152 33 123 126 149 137 86 164 62 161	I wonder where his friends are?
161	99 211 92 109 78 175 200 154 171 66 161	merciful, gracious, magnanimous
161	26 116 166 127 81 14 36 132 43 152 161	I'm not sure if I'd have my shoes off. The floor looks dirty.
161	170 29 52 183 171 12 175 144 11 141 161	I wish they'd help these people out
161	144 72 202 157 106 85 83 51 149 10 161	The small helicopter quietly sits next to its big brother
161	188 9 63 67 202 78 136 163 100 176 161	Beauty requires work, as demonstrated by the gorgeous Venetian waterways.
161	31 45 48 14 74 167 104 6 92 112 161	The bus serves a good purpose
161	202 135 167 15 53 156 56 36 181 111 161	Smiling through the pain, her team is victorious!
161	121 195 122 209 47 19 194 104 56 148 161	I hope to raise children in an area as beautiful and open as this.
161	209 195 139 64 73 112 79 63 13 99 161	Congratulations! I know the feeling!

162	5 56 90 21 63 189 165 50 51 176 162	That was when Pixar was good.
162	174 150 93 208 46 78 135 169 44 88 162	unseen man in the road
162	108 93 90 205 171 116 98 137 112 201 162	This line of motorcyclists looks like a funeral procession.
162	215 6 89 87 124 199 151 184 97 15 162	The car and the house do not match.
162	215 205 7 111 10 193 183 204 138 144 162	Just taking a nap
162	96 154 174 58 153 90 139 128 161 74 162	The march resulted in many deaths.
162	47 170 56 88 39 210 43 139 54 126 162	These lambs will end up as wolf food.
162	93 40 63 53 133 2 118 25 116 42 162	Each of these fence posts represents all that remains of a once grand tree.
162	151 35 212 39 82 120 28 52 190 134 162	It is truly a sad occasion that brings us together today.
162	149 88 196 60 89 97 163 50 198 31 162	I can no longer skate board.  It is very sad.
162	71 9 97 118 140 28 56 76 137 187 162	I don't think she's having the best time.
162	117 20 177 38 205 128 48 178 139 67 162	The green woman disrobed in front of the green door as we prayed.
162	110 11 159 161 143 21 59 155 30 134 162	My grandmother had earrings like this.

162	204 28 166 94 72 51 86 71 22 92 162	Those were the good old days.  It's too bad time changes everything.
162	51 185 33 61 175 16 190 63 155 170 162	i am so sorry that happened to you
162	106 184 119 198 154 89 37 173 207 159 162	These people picking up trash or very wise
162	134 33 169 94 40 122 3 174 145 90 162	This looks pretty.
162	121 64 30 163 105 28 102 92 74 5 162	This lady is very wise in eating that dessert slowly
162	171 44 71 13 33 61 189 206 11 186 162	Abraham Lincoln does not look that pleases.
162	157 202 7 136 36 64 47 107 112 176 162	This reminds me of something... I can't remember what, but I feel sad.
162	211 195 203 44 123 131 109 96 16 62 162	Maybe the last sunset I'll ever see
162	46 203 40 15 85 37 13 78 176 11 162	Don't get lost in the woods.
162	29 26 187 76 47 85 35 130 3 136 162	Its a depressing color, makes me feel lonely
162	164 186 201 184 215 18 16 97 14 75 162	Looks like fun.
162	19 159 106 107 141 154 84 20 173 184 162	Reminds me of a cold winters day.
162	158 185 1 119 102 109 93 189 81 24 162	serious, towering, highflown
162	159 6 195 199 116 135 85 35 196 17 162	this is someone's well lvoed home
162	32 94 125 123 40 54 1 198 120 142 162	This is truly scary.
162	215 195 179 120 23 203 26 76 71 43 162	Why does she look sad?
162	72 11 99 159 40 121 70 18 211 78 162	These guys may not be around anymore
162	22 128 122 193 136 67 40 52 156 45 162	About to have some me time
162	93 131 126 81 159 27 74 140 106 56 162	this is gross
162	183 58 50 107 156 81 149 88 93 192 162	very gloomy day
162	69 1 194 213 131 110 149 132 202 129 162	The speech was commenorating all those who have not succeeded.
162	18 7 43 183 1 91 30 4 93 199 162	when I went back and thought  about it  I was  solemn
162	189 78 84 124 130 156 37 119 207 72 162	Looks like a quite group.  Too quiet.
162	181 86 99 155 56 76 69 106 20 41 162	This movie was more sad than anything else.
162	196 42 203 45 61 69 49 10 195 124 162	In this place it is quiet and full of peace.
162	198 69 54 201 4 85 82 81 117 105 162	Walking and looking in these mirror reflections bring me so much joy.
162	143 174 133 16 75 31 49 94 5 199 162	I can imagine being at peace here.
162	6 44 207 113 185 62 148 196 197 130 162	These people will probably leave each others lives at some point. Friendship is hard.
162	59 15 105 25 189 173 211 48 207 64 162	This car isn't so smart.
162	96 23 97 138 72 215 35 34 67 116 162	That bedding is very nice.
162	27 2 142 167 59 124 183 200 163 21 162	trees that are independent of the world
162	211 174 69 194 215 182 70 115 30 41 162	Must be a dancer of a dancing team
162	204 215 196 32 135 71 137 51 91 184 162	The detail in this room is incredibly detailed.
162	114 84 12 125 183 166 136 172 8 43 162	It is sad that all the people left the area. This use to be such a busy courtyard.
162	154 11 182 208 124 59 121 64 214 119 162	I usually  visit that place once in a while
162	23 54 69 122 174 11 126 199 84 180 162	Having an thin wax applied the commercial showed the tomatoes as an give away
162	123 16 150 37 70 161 19 113 57 179 162	Looks like a sad night.
162	161 196 208 169 89 62 125 126 40 56 162	I feel so sad about these animal on my lawn. I live out in the country and know that with hunting season coming soon, they will not survive for long.
162	103 13 170 168 75 81 197 122 173 24 162	The birds in the trees look very majestic
162	190 177 204 20 104 214 96 78 148 119 162	Returning to the island where some sad things happened.
162	168 40 214 158 156 29 118 128 109 10 162	this reminds me of my mother who passed
162	199 157 19 195 151 166 134 78 97 29 162	An alright picture.
162	127 151 131 184 99 142 55 73 164 183 162	This park looks so serene. Hoping the world can find peace in times of turmoil.
162	17 197 193 48 114 5 208 130 68 94 162	White barn grandly perched on a hill
162	42 40 102 160 182 170 12 13 144 148 162	In memory of those we've lost
162	205 20 73 5 38 53 22 197 67 178 162	Impressive city lights
162	130 12 43 27 152 107 23 84 122 40 162	The buildings fill me with a solemn sense of the past.
162	173 7 56 155 68 188 55 175 120 118 162	This is an scen of morbid, golemn like spectre
162	183 75 5 100 131 35 56 168 176 132 162	A bike like this reminds me of my fallen son's. I miss him every day.
162	87 89 102 181 18 124 35 69 133 177 162	Families create such beautiful images.
162	61 69 42 34 143 74 163 79 73 189 162	We should be quiet around here
162	67 17 75 39 45 25 5 175 123 86 162	He looks lonely, where are his lizard friends?
162	211 151 212 2 31 37 14 90 210 86 162	a moment of silence
162	127 63 68 138 196 177 32 159 80 53 162	It is the fire dept truck, they help people from all walks of life unconditionally.
162	210 204 111 152 94 165 150 176 74 90 162	Squash is not very yummy, this is a sad meal
162	107 210 17 196 39 135 86 90 159 113 162	Incredible brickwork for an oven
162	25 65 43 201 64 167 39 44 172 179 162	Everytime I attend such events, I wish I had a date to bring with me.
162	161 132 194 23 93 57 214 143 184 79 162	None will be forgotten
162	82 123 22 201 1 96 143 33 185 213 162	I once had a dream to buy an old plane and live in it.
162	174 68 42 150 202 45 128 69 75 114 162	All kites will fall eventually
162	101 174 105 159 134 186 23 212 125 19 162	I have never seen such a car, I don't know if I can understand it.
162	133 45 186 42 205 144 3 41 202 176 162	This game looks so worrisome. I hope nobody hurts themself.
162	13 194 134 102 150 80 156 20 213 22 162	Thiscar honestly looks fine. Even though red isn't my favourite color it suits the car decently.
162	143 178 61 164 201 76 135 40 80 34 162	This is a very depressing photo, plant looks so sad.
162	124 36 81 112 172 79 8 28 155 30 162	Revisiting this old place
162	91 159 200 34 2 30 176 61 65 178 162	Praying for the island. I feel so bad for them.
162	36 26 98 205 154 29 84 118 48 122 162	I can't see a lot of fun parties happening in this dungeon-like place.
162	102 52 73 76 75 171 38 190 13 91 162	withered time gone by.
162	77 11 215 89 123 41 211 76 19 12 162	Quiet reserved space, beautifully manicured to pay respects.
162	32 118 104 168 151 194 137 71 185 51 162	a sacred place
162	82 207 120 212 126 22 51 153 99 108 162	Those flowers had me thinking that I was going to see a different kind of ceremony.
162	132 186 14 90 58 16 85 1 150 210 162	That could be some cancer speech
162	156 37 24 172 208 168 90 115 26 166 162	The ducks have not been well lately.
162	103 209 184 52 156 69 60 182 28 83 162	he will be missed :(
162	135 84 196 144 90 24 136 73 21 137 162	An lone blossom on the brisk

164	90 176 189 132 8 88 54 130 145 127 164	Let's climb to the top.
164	114 18 44 45 80 215 171 134 149 143 164	I bet I can beat all of you in a race up that hill!
164	103 2 63 145 54 150 34 93 33 37 164	Deep breath. You can do this
164	42 5 211 73 139 183 186 66 112 98 164	That house is beautiful!
164	52 157 81 44 89 124 85 118 153 35 164	The underdog is determined to not give up!
164	206 22 60 88 163 188 97 125 87 67 164	Even though the water was green and murky, I dove in anyway!
164	156 189 102 84 93 77 108 58 38 73 164	Not bright enough for me.
164	58 9 120 78 28 2 143 103 53 3 164	I would love a chance to hike in this area
164	109 37 58 146 16 214 68 191 55 158 164	I'm not afraid to try any of those weird foods.
164	124 173 53 80 160 189 152 151 54 174 164	Good on these guys for being out there in the cold!
164	28 135 180 169 131 133 105 93 134 75 164	I would go up as high as I could for a good photo
164	102 159 167 214 72 209 78 182 50 115 164	That fire looks like it could travel, I need to jump in there and help put it out.
164	117 188 107 190 63 116 105 100 60 67 164	Seems like that picture took a lot of time and patience, something I would be good at.

164	98 20 64 156 113 106 17 6 53 70 164	It is brave to paint a bird on a wall
164	12 36 192 104 60 59 46 199 7 101 164	Id like to tear down this green wall and find the monster behind it
164	43 196 110 127 158 111 86 7 78 31 164	such a beautiful clouds
164	136 183 167 93 55 106 99 31 186 109 164	It would take a strong confident person to wear that hat out
164	168 88 79 77 171 116 149 67 197 71 164	This carriage looks rickety. But I would ride it in order to get to you!
164	3 202 95 49 184 191 139 96 27 208 164	I would love to dance with the entire line of ladies.

164	83 197 77 174 50 45 157 162 42 210 164	I want to swim across that entire ocean just to see if I could. People would talk about me for decades if I did.
164	14 129 134 7 28 52 177 47 74 84 164	let me drink with these guys.
164	148 98 167 118 14 150 208 115 207 100 164	I've never seen anything like this. I would try it though!
164	105 86 26 37 74 136 122 100 132 69 164	I would battle a dinosaur!
164	86 163 181 64 99 107 93 90 79 91 164	that was a great ob
164	70 147 135 24 10 108 215 173 149 6 164	What a great shot! I once went camping in a similar place. We almost froze to death, but it was such an amazing experience!
164	114 60 191 106 193 133 16 124 32 109 164	That looks like so much fun, I would totally drive a bike.
164	10 58 81 83 1 139 42 185 108 91 164	The architecture is very daunting.
164	100 57 26 185 145 91 37 17 213 43 164	Looking ready to take on any challenge.
164	72 56 29 33 121 10 153 38 26 87 164	He is a strong boy
164	185 58 36 121 148 34 92 76 11 145 164	I'm going to find a cure for roaches with these chemicals.
164	169 129 34 202 100 172 192 2 31 210 164	The brave sand people live with lions and bears as pets.
164	91 118 191 115 56 152 214 37 15 36 164	I'd love to swim in that!
164	182 184 156 24 55 122 199 193 28 189 164	I can't believe you were able to get those to plant.
164	70 145 148 74 159 67 64 140 147 142 164	This reminds me there is a clean water protest next week. Let's go!
164	128 145 67 2 77 15 72 81 132 184 164	yes! I am constantly trying to figure myself out
164	18 128 92 156 43 81 30 37 188 196 164	I can break this with my hand
164	151 43 24 84 82 12 174 36 187 106 164	I'm going to get over my fear of flying finally!
164	193 113 69 24 183 120 81 158 130 59 164	These people are risking their lives to help many.
164	92 214 14 108 110 11 141 84 159 66 164	Those are beautiful animals dealing with a difficult situation. They are an inspiration.
164	60 202 95 24 73 187 100 203 177 56 164	VACATION TIME. LET RIDE OUR BIKES ALL DAY ON THIS STREET UNTIL NIGHTFALL.
164	199 201 125 56 63 122 155 57 29 181 164	I would love to drive this car down a huge hill!
164	99 210 40 154 59 120 65 147 45 190 164	Time to try something new!
165	68 161 158 206 116 155 130 145 215 88 165	That place is perfect for all sorts of activities! You could climb, make tree houses, or even have paintball fights!
165	214 92 119 49 197 71 112 8 78 41 165	Ok whoever took this picture must be 2 feet tall. This is what happens when you give midgets cameras.
165	85 12 189 36 214 101 39 25 43 176 165	This child should dance for the fun of it!
165	10 102 39 74 57 58 189 111 61 193 165	Hopefully the bird doesn't take the man off into the sky when it flies away!
165	19 148 126 200 146 47 93 183 210 152 165	I'm pretty sure I saw this painting at the Louvre. Might have been in the restroom.
165	95 177 201 43 180 108 35 52 89 24 165	Those ducklings are so cute! I just want to pick them up!
165	182 210 205 74 48 152 146 204 51 79 165	I wouldnt mind playing in the water
165	11 140 86 105 136 191 175 151 94 193 165	This is a good spot to play tag
165	100 208 40 169 182 128 162 201 98 8 165	I hate non-car vehicles on the roads.
165	29 40 192 119 145 196 121 141 65 71 165	This is his first picture with an older man.
165	15 8 69 53 190 26 92 79 122 23 165	This dog looks like fun.
165	47 131 89 9 188 105 73 154 123 12 165	This is a big open space, we could play tag!
165	159 209 158 121 65 116 183 98 23 148 165	I could just hide out here all day long.
165	66 106 35 33 7 34 159 20 204 75 165	SIGH Goodbye, Cabin! Hello 9-5 jive...
165	133 120 172 130 77 204 93 191 137 173 165	This color reminds me of a journey through the woods.

165	178 129 187 35 170 161 150 53 203 28 165	I would love to live in that enchantingly beautiful castle.
165	27 11 77 202 40 91 12 83 174 186 165	Like a kid in a candy store
165	23 33 55 2 91 13 209 88 135 171 165	Kids bring so much joy to simple situations! But I bring the #dadjokes

165	83 194 56 203 102 106 130 206 201 85 165	I love my dog's fur. It's so soft and warm.
165	43 91 41 119 105 205 128 100 14 57 165	An art is the showcase of talent, specially the art of the ancient experts!
165	157 85 36 74 129 200 93 50 162 110 165	there is nothing like a good fancy bread after a morning romp
165	79 141 160 144 70 31 85 191 32 148 165	Looking so different
165	44 110 213 42 131 35 176 119 41 205 165	The girl is really into her performance.
165	32 186 34 135 11 46 104 119 155 118 165	It would be fun to skip a rock there
165	86 207 151 134 153 183 12 140 182 75 165	I need that many bathrooms :)
165	46 67 96 16 121 157 172 85 129 141 165	ooo i wonder what that does

165	75 133 31 159 106 156 157 71 104 137 165	That monkey is going to climb on that rope and go so high!
165	103 134 196 146 201 37 128 138 30 46 165	I'd just love to frolic throughout this forest and forget the world even exists.
165	65 132 35 147 57 37 215 17 25 172 165	Oh how I would adore the opportunity to dance on the rooftop of this beautiful creation!

165	201 83 162 92 140 170 154 4 113 2 165	I'd love to have drinks outdoors like this.
165	44 25 115 138 160 17 205 144 146 108 165	She looks so lovely, like a proper doll! I wonder is she's come from down the rabbit hole?
165	7 20 112 62 72 192 110 180 174 44 165	That looks like me.
165	51 150 40 46 181 185 153 107 5 106 165	The skyline looks like its straight out of a painting.
165	103 58 161 171 133 187 147 34 150 85 165	Hah! That smile just shouts, "Yeah, this is a sweet tie!"

165	207 11 145 65 160 184 57 123 36 169 165	The flower burned red like a dwarf star.  Petals of mass flash yellow and attract attention.
165	161 38 204 65 46 85 35 187 205 84 165	This is Pete's reaction when he "discovered" he was going to be a daddy in 6 months.

165	23 205 184 83 82 177 62 28 4 161 165	I wonder if fairies live at the end of this path?
165	11 40 126 27 82 24 6 113 57 21 165	This could be a lovely chandelier over the dining room table.
165	175 2 104 163 40 156 186 39 18 207 165	Haha, I bet the kid in the back with the green earmuffs is having a grandiose time! Looks fun.

166	39 96 136 183 103 22 109 117 111 155 166	What is even happening?
166	208 13 118 101 80 153 149 52 62 156 166	I don't get why their roofs are so pointy compared to other cities.  Seems weird.
166	192 177 77 51 94 159 95 151 25 152 166	Those kids need to focus, they look lazy.
166	202 133 85 120 108 4 78 182 84 90 166	I hope they both win!
166	148 111 35 126 122 151 48 88 130 78 166	so yum!! love eating fresh fish
166	136 106 182 35 195 196 161 175 52 94 166	You know what, who cares if this looks neat or not
166	136 80 188 120 30 9 139 206 23 27 166	This runner was that he's about to pass out and I don't really care
166	147 120 68 48 20 100 131 17 171 184 166	I wish I could sing,
166	145 156 139 215 80 170 36 197 208 76 166	That food looks terrible.
166	183 60 125 3 72 2 185 97 99 173 166	I don't want to visit there.
166	3 152 2 65 1 101 37 191 14 84 166	I really don't care what this dude has to say.
166	204 40 127 125 211 208 214 83 179 123 166	I would be bored out of my mind!
166	168 182 83 22 20 209 169 15 130 29 166	Dirty car and dirty yard. Meh
166	177 107 72 60 209 184 11 25 3 156 166	Protesting will no do much if you don't vote
166	147 46 19 94 135 1 56 73 160 112 166	You seen one plane you seen them all
166	44 183 56 6 123 142 139 46 119 161 166	Whatever that is, let's just walk around it.
166	157 21 189 180 96 69 191 45 100 115 166	This bus looks old and junky. Who gives a crap, not me.
166	40 38 88 167 144 5 119 163 79 101 166	Insects eat from flowers, just nature here.
166	142 109 65 4 101 3 90 50 202 66 166	I wish I could be out and about on a beautiful day right now!
166	32 130 58 12 160 66 20 167 63 78 166	Why would he want that?
166	89 151 169 195 47 179 54 170 77 182 166	this sky is always this color of blue
166	30 34 179 187 45 115 40 206 203 214 166	I never learned this language but whatever
166	68 121 145 17 209 21 131 70 48 73 166	I am tired of this tree.
166	163 132 158 97 48 208 117 45 212 21 166	Looks like this is about trees. Who cares about tress?
166	180 213 101 139 37 83 147 171 40 75 166	Not sure what they're standing around for.
166	57 145 209 68 91 185 53 125 93 30 166	The water looks green and murky.  The image reflected is blurry.
166	46 160 165 105 212 107 78 156 68 49 166	A kissing between the couple is shown in the picture.
166	19 143 98 42 41 116 190 193 35 121 166	looking at something
166	171 143 187 135 131 110 53 20 213 16 166	It's nature, I guess.
166	144 112 99 10 83 81 119 4 199 75 166	Who really cares what type of tree that is?
166	191 215 47 123 68 111 179 63 112 158 166	Where some may see nostalgia, I see an old engine that has far outlived its usefulness.
166	144 108 177 42 136 76 215 125 4 178 166	Why do I need to look at this boring, purple square?
166	153 1 178 167 93 82 207 193 4 52 166	Who cares what happens to this bird.
166	81 150 55 89 61 54 34 157 103 154 166	Why do people think photos of the sky are so deep. It's boring.
166	204 213 206 109 150 85 199 61 185 130 166	So what another picture of a building we have all seen a million times.
166	52 8 159 141 28 55 40 193 122 160 166	you should get out more
166	160 106 70 177 18 112 157 202 140 10 166	Bubbles are a waste of time.
166	144 89 17 146 209 114 197 9 138 185 166	Boring generic picture of dancing
166	176 11 27 212 117 142 143 45 32 203 166	Looks like a boring waste of time to me.
166	126 5 215 109 39 175 120 121 75 191 166	I am unimpressed.
166	209 171 116 148 81 100 69 101 160 136 166	why are you posting these kids standing there doing nothing.
166	183 116 59 87 123 103 44 210 34 77 166	who cares what this things is
166	87 66 88 20 35 104 181 129 96 107 166	I guess this is an all-MacBook meeting.
166	88 64 130 67 2 81 44 149 114 34 166	I really don't care about the history of that.
166	56 82 36 95 109 178 168 89 38 18 166	Your plane is going... somewhere.
166	96 86 115 172 102 66 177 103 149 147 166	I don't want a shot, these people are loud and obnoxious.
166	159 71 79 87 97 119 164 83 28 41 166	I'm already tired of looking at this. Next picture.
166	141 160 175 186 152 5 10 176 120 72 166	I don't see why people do this.
166	190 129 52 34 4 123 198 48 151 38 166	Is it obvious that she is cold?
166	30 119 169 54 103 215 101 87 60 41 166	oh another image of buildings
166	31 47 203 197 72 23 121 93 201 3 166	A building we saw
166	74 191 133 69 6 56 29 94 150 132 166	It is so apathetic to stdy this rocks.
166	23 71 50 205 68 4 184 42 155 105 166	driving is a skill dont intend to kill
166	52 183 108 114 151 22 121 193 94 215 166	The rain serves them right
166	122 75 125 170 153 120 109 119 35 65 166	I see cats. I also see grass.
166	167 78 73 198 162 168 148 169 37 9 166	skyline from nowhere usa
166	112 90 194 204 139 186 28 1 129 135 166	so its a person with a horsehead on... ok next
166	116 65 98 63 29 82 197 115 95 109 166	I could care less about trees like this, they might as well be torn down.
166	153 162 24 38 214 106 53 100 137 193 166	Who cares?  It was just an old tree.
166	126 143 132 119 175 27 64 89 48 39 166	It's some old Asian type of place.
166	89 13 202 11 48 16 44 29 80 7 166	they are not having fun
166	69 156 16 50 116 185 29 73 55 79 166	The quote was so simple.
166	148 202 33 1 60 45 21 62 18 8 166	I do not care if my kids got a picture taken, I hated the movie.
166	141 119 159 148 201 6 112 169 72 127 166	Advertising dog does not care about you.
166	81 181 22 207 36 59 50 195 100 199 166	Oh.  Golly.  What fun.
166	208 64 211 207 186 117 116 187 54 94 166	That guy should get the tripod out of the road.
166	72 38 56 164 94 115 150 43 116 214 166	I care nothing about what I'm seeing
166	152 149 15 43 125 192 201 103 177 27 166	Boring old building
166	37 42 175 118 117 43 146 160 68 192 166	A very normal building in a bland and normal town.
166	136 215 81 123 59 4 28 193 79 122 166	THIS LOSER NEEDS A HAIR TRIM
166	84 164 137 129 41 92 188 81 54 50 166	Some bunch of Chinese words.
166	118 45 33 99 128 79 132 62 25 182 166	That dress doesn't suit her.
166	133 73 187 102 4 204 210 146 78 54 166	I just do not care about this type of art.
166	16 20 61 65 196 43 41 146 67 197 166	A mother-daughter relationship
166	214 1 47 190 33 140 188 103 55 155 166	I don't see any interesting art here.
166	29 121 111 86 47 82 175 21 130 178 166	Why paint fruit?
166	114 56 193 5 99 70 73 158 92 107 166	What a boring looking cat!
166	109 199 30 1 61 57 145 195 94 83 166	This looks really boring
166	83 165 144 87 176 189 197 18 195 191 166	Dead trees make me not care about life.
166	54 185 181 15 87 157 51 89 42 91 166	Don't get it. It's a large ball. What's the big deal?
166	140 100 66 206 87 162 10 189 142 121 166	Why is he with the flag
166	204 181 72 125 134 52 19 66 114 132 166	The dog is stupid for being in the road. If it gets hit it's its own fault.
166	62 73 172 81 178 59 40 54 152 97 166	Could do without them.
166	6 3 37 109 114 122 205 148 83 25 166	Why does she look so grumpy?
166	203 132 89 69 80 193 153 183 125 201 166	Looks boring and something I would be super bored at.
166	23 177 89 163 208 91 147 95 79 158 166	This guy might wipe out or maybe not
166	20 55 32 37 60 157 127 83 11 90 166	I didn't need to see this
166	200 64 61 185 93 68 74 123 59 63 166	great, another aerial view of boring buildings
166	136 115 140 172 96 176 92 175 48 214 166	Wow, good thing this guy has his thumb up so we know he gives this landscape his seal of approval.
166	25 146 202 93 213 108 114 204 147 68 166	Who cares about sports
166	209 5 182 63 201 204 40 69 91 46 166	What a boring color!
166	24 119 198 208 182 43 26 161 169 140 166	I don't know what this is a picture of and I couldn't care less.
166	105 196 46 163 180 59 170 184 19 206 166	He has no life whatsoever
166	75 185 55 167 131 99 25 176 60 23 166	She ought to fall
167	214 133 203 122 157 17 33 61 140 146 167	Why is it blurry?? I could have taken it better
167	169 212 34 166 38 28 181 109 158 51 167	I can play better baseball than any of these guys here
167	181 210 69 198 188 30 154 196 35 10 167	This is all mine and no one can come here.
167	66 27 192 181 114 47 92 156 209 43 167	I remember last time i went camping.
167	181 171 60 158 131 33 182 29 34 176 167	gloomy, sunny, peaceful
167	146 59 5 39 14 179 26 141 90 214 167	I bet this would take the best pictures of me.
167	53 129 81 5 31 24 51 110 122 158 167	This guy better be careful, only I can turn that low.
167	31 103 172 151 126 62 75 204 178 45 167	I would look better in this picture.
167	176 140 160 75 191 56 42 29 159 78 167	Im probably better than both of these players.
167	210 214 15 204 6 4 84 150 33 147 167	This is my artful decor
167	90 129 178 139 81 161 158 209 115 154 167	I earned this vacation because I was the absolute best salesman this company has.
167	199 159 130 1 68 181 132 44 71 31 167	I bet I could play it better.
167	172 75 78 177 116 139 24 49 142 115 167	i want this to have my embedded name on it.
167	14 76 87 125 207 119 20 97 143 43 167	Experts like myself wouldn't think twice about using form as sloppy and unenthusiastic as this.
167	177 50 186 7 77 120 207 31 187 68 167	I like to be the center of attention too!
167	61 108 198 171 200 210 75 186 161 160 167	.Boat Stupid This On Be To Want Not Do I
167	188 25 40 92 127 123 181 144 15 121 167	Hey, I have a shirt exactly the same color as that fish.  I look great in that shirt!
167	42 108 140 50 24 213 103 137 41 55 167	I can't believe there isn't a covered area to walk with all these seagulls flying around! I don't want to ruin my expensive coat.
167	38 90 105 80 205 76 47 133 155 153 167	I can't believe they're all looking forward
167	44 166 2 195 196 194 211 72 95 186 167	This guy doesn
167	12 150 201 54 125 111 113 141 140 16 167	I am far too important to spend time with children
167	164 37 35 97 141 8 71 49 43 110 167	?It Is Good What So ,Me For Anything Do Can't Building Old That
167	165 58 128 120 88 67 163 79 3 104 167	Those two ladies don't deserve my presence.
167	114 186 104 52 211 61 91 76 78 175 167	What an egotistical monument.
167	45 38 25 46 136 159 210 193 34 180 167	I had a much better reception when I was awarded.
167	148 4 187 47 35 116 78 85 132 9 167	This picture is too dark
167	149 189 169 45 23 170 160 24 66 143 167	This guy has nothing on me
167	59 94 56 23 41 135 151 156 159 105 167	The sculpture speaks to me and reminds me of how complex of a person I am.
167	215 195 179 205 42 13 82 123 22 163 167	I bet he thinks that he is so smart.
167	196 191 21 62 12 147 35 93 107 9 167	The ball belongs to me
167	159 209 140 69 182 196 29 51 200 175 167	I probably would have scored 2 plays before this!
167	100 69 153 31 155 111 143 92 5 152 167	A green color background is shown
167	156 159 90 9 41 162 64 135 108 133 167	This cream makes my face look so beautiful!
167	45 165 77 148 16 195 208 82 186 116 167	I could do that easily
167	78 113 88 59 92 196 126 17 44 72 167	I took a photo just like this , except the restaurant was way nicer.
167	73 159 117 188 172 200 9 69 213 10 167	I wouldn't waste my time standing around like that
167	25 125 206 69 46 54 52 142 119 211 167	My car is better.
167	51 73 43 102 105 178 151 122 21 117 167	Is that my private jet?
167	181 59 139 68 101 158 98 91 200 189 167	sleep mymtmy  in sunset a of photo better a taken have could I

167	198 107 132 157 200 161 96 99 186 30 167	I want to be the leader of this empire
167	158 183 215 171 205 4 206 116 74 121 167	I have better skin than this guy.
167	10 61 98 118 11 185 60 2 21 203 167	She is not walking by me because she is mad at me
167	10 211 126 60 147 35 139 171 50 91 167	He looks lost, and I thought he was a know it all.
167	90 124 168 77 173 174 113 20 185 14 167	If I built this, it would be so much better.
167	46 132 52 155 35 212 120 49 211 55 167	Dang, I wish I was that guy was pulling on my arm. That should be me getting all the attention. I want everyone to pull me like that for attention.
167	124 149 56 64 160 203 163 146 53 127 167	I wouldn't ever spend that much money on a place that wasted so much space

168	40 183 10 97 139 57 124 60 19 141 168	These geese are absolutely WONDERFUL!
168	85 114 14 24 16 153 191 7 94 202 168	The old structure had personality that could not be seen by the naked eye.
168	153 184 133 82 182 73 76 111 46 83 168	She should have more respect for herself
169	64 1 182 26 114 160 85 172 10 36 169	Is this a picture from a security cam? Did you hack it? We are being watched all the time.
169	132 10 98 187 184 136 162 179 100 181 169	I need to know her time!
169	145 192 79 154 89 203 78 22 211 94 169	I don't know who is going to win!
169	22 84 24 172 192 113 118 94 188 149 169	I really hope that car runs well
169	20 42 152 139 14 161 114 39 166 107 169	The chalkboard are too small.
169	109 213 26 128 34 171 135 105 192 162 169	This photo is enticing but skeptical.
169	26 195 145 63 110 38 131 181 112 108 169	Those staring eyes make me feel uncomfortable.
169	28 6 108 197 87 181 148 71 23 19 169	I'm really worried about this. Why is this picture like this? Is there something wrong??
169	113 183 81 148 106 121 200 180 90 1 169	That dog looks like it could be dangerous.
169	153 52 147 138 102 114 140 51 135 87 169	Now everybody get ready--at the count of 3 I want you all to flash the camera..1, 2...3!
169	120 141 67 210 104 89 165 64 172 137 169	I am worried about cameras taking over.
169	67 214 45 66 158 144 209 56 21 157 169	I woudn't want to be that close to him!
169	123 7 115 97 154 71 106 38 51 195 169	sleepy, tense, calm
169	91 187 167 146 136 202 172 68 11 109 169	He's about to sneeze!
169	109 63 171 9 52 150 136 64 214 201 169	I would not want on the inside of this.
169	38 97 75 42 78 59 118 207 146 190 169	The Christmas trees are nice, but I worry they could topple over!
169	164 159 67 179 109 72 149 47 14 23 169	There are so many people on that boat
169	111 132 2 146 157 79 184 171 97 122 169	That stage doesn't look like it's the most stable, hopefully they don't fall.
169	107 7 140 117 45 179 34 26 188 126 169	Man i hate crowds.
169	180 157 57 162 80 211 183 38 41 99 169	That wall is so yellowed, I bet it smells like cigarettes in there. It would make me nervous.
169	159 100 102 213 29 21 42 137 165 43 169	She heads down the court. She stops. She shoots. She scores!
169	52 101 59 69 178 90 142 195 8 22 169	That little bird has got to be cold. What if he froze?!?!
169	138 117 126 71 8 68 3 101 136 159 169	He looks like he about to squeeze that bottle in half.
169	129 151 15 17 196 138 188 148 94 1 169	These lights are about to give me a seizure
169	203 152 42 13 121 190 82 211 158 175 169	Seriously, can't you get an updated tv?
169	35 101 97 203 44 108 45 199 181 126 169	I can't get a good view!
169	40 109 102 14 83 84 122 203 65 170 169	so stuffy so bland
169	142 160 173 25 191 13 59 122 119 108 169	I can't believe how close this race was but I actually won!
169	37 34 114 138 163 109 171 196 54 16 169	That's a beautiful wall but how structurally sound could it be? One big gust of wind and who knows what could happen.
169	17 62 161 96 92 187 70 125 60 186 169	Oh, there's still legs attached to some of these things. I just don't like eating things with legs.
169	157 100 97 98 17 84 199 82 212 14 169	Careful out there!  Not the safest place to be.  Makes me nervous!
169	32 87 145 33 172 96 38 184 44 131 169	He really look like he is stressed out and just hiding it with a smile.
169	157 63 195 58 31 42 173 184 205 196 169	Not Sure I could ever squeeze in
169	153 96 74 148 124 125 179 158 63 79 169	I hope whoever took this photo isn't driving
169	49 192 48 183 12 211 81 203 70 182 169	don't get stuck inside your barian
169	78 45 17 188 199 4 146 124 25 132 169	Oh goodness, I hope they don't hurt each other.
169	135 30 107 103 188 101 159 96 47 194 169	that dog on the wall stresses me out..
169	101 41 102 77 25 126 18 120 118 184 169	Buildings like this make me so worried, they just have a strange mood.
169	112 38 83 181 160 155 3 87 146 213 169	my friggin life man...
169	168 147 148 91 189 63 130 44 98 209 169	those look creepy
169	55 97 140 177 147 58 29 175 74 207 169	I feel like they're judging me.
169	78 161 134 33 99 13 155 74 158 37 169	Looks nice but...What are the safety features?
169	65 67 149 79 84 42 116 168 209 125 169	Its so tense in there I can cut butter
169	212 138 165 19 136 176 21 198 131 76 169	A beautiful gathering
169	52 170 153 214 160 66 82 25 156 185 169	This seems dangerous
169	211 182 192 208 144 14 187 96 45 16 169	That koala looks like it might fall.
169	106 48 192 140 136 141 53 104 72 81 169	I dont know about this
169	58 99 181 42 113 30 100 173 143 10 169	How can lemonade be non organic?
169	149 33 142 36 10 197 32 148 203 100 169	I would be very very nervous to walk through there.
169	172 175 17 171 98 102 134 164 184 188 169	He should probably ask before trying to eat that food haha!
169	147 100 213 73 54 59 92 53 137 153 169	Oh..they shouldn't act so happy anything could happen
169	23 10 107 125 178 147 64 123 117 78 169	Watch that baby
169	133 77 143 14 101 62 47 29 109 72 169	tall buildings scare me
169	109 85 84 207 3 139 11 160 211 120 169	Those birds look like they may eat me.
169	179 6 3 5 85 64 108 167 110 59 169	This mess.  Look at this mess!  I can't even look at it, my anxiety levels are so high.
169	117 122 34 156 172 5 124 193 157 118 169	This job looks stressful
169	205 128 142 88 183 46 147 51 190 14 169	He looks at easy but still somewhat rigid.
169	159 55 199 200 120 7 141 130 93 9 169	I'm not sure about this whole flying thing.
169	145 50 125 211 193 181 75 39 87 6 169	He looks like he's about to fall
169	18 17 47 210 12 37 81 98 73 34 169	Why is it so dark?
169	111 131 67 202 108 204 176 196 147 72 169	I don't think I'd be able to ride in a hot air balloon, I'd be way too nervous.
169	67 187 204 4 167 197 92 20 34 9 169	I'm very nervous about taking exams here.
169	82 89 197 152 166 195 84 151 163 99 169	uh ohh  dont fall
169	208 131 35 150 24 58 74 34 105 4 169	A tense moment came when Jesper missed his cue to start playing.
169	14 13 57 208 4 168 164 16 137 144 169	That beak looks really strong; I would hate to be bitten by it.
169	107 63 77 28 109 126 183 42 10 25 169	I felt nervous in the court room, before they read the verdict.
169	77 196 186 123 109 31 190 60 86 65 169	Not my type of menu, really don't like milkshakes
169	1 59 142 16 181 92 80 193 139 146 169	I'm worried there might be a huge argument here.
169	52 145 2 44 113 213 193 131 147 166 169	I hope he gets back onstage OK.
169	215 144 172 8 107 56 185 4 49 121 169	When I was making the meal I was quite  tense
169	89 164 146 153 4 165 204 94 32 67 169	We're all going to die!
169	186 1 193 88 117 28 50 4 51 184 169	I hope this weather lasts
169	129 36 111 164 72 177 184 192 94 207 169	If I was in this guys shoes I would be very nervous.
169	128 136 176 107 28 198 114 55 175 116 169	THE MEETING WAS TENSE UNTIL IT WAS OVER.
169	5 95 124 164 87 85 34 154 197 161 169	I will not climb up there.
169	116 35 187 23 133 205 9 38 125 160 169	Looks like a stressful situation, we forgot to the tell the new guy we don't work on Friday.
169	23 105 172 13 177 110 67 44 24 152 169	Someone's going to fall.
169	179 8 87 14 89 145 184 18 36 166 169	I wonder if he really knows how to play.
169	134 76 101 150 111 157 93 20 59 112 169	The uneasy peace was formalized in a signed treaty.
169	204 98 101 166 29 198 177 155 174 167 169	These young people should have more respect for themselves
169	16 8 28 14 166 57 51 131 173 80 169	They seem as if they are getting married, only to begin a life to strain and tension.
169	85 165 16 118 34 158 203 93 39 157 169	Nope, no dressing room scenes with this guy.
169	51 61 135 126 107 14 70 75 56 141 169	I cant believe what just happened
169	9 56 65 112 81 32 136 86 1 14 169	Very shiny expensive looking old car
169	215 108 39 16 72 103 86 25 206 31 169	I would never take a picture with them, I hate selfies, and I hate cameras all up IN MY FACE!
169	16 127 139 134 167 195 153 54 10 35 169	Too bad there aren't any jobs.
169	81 4 99 88 57 61 185 70 74 187 169	why is the caboose there
169	154 28 88 26 4 204 166 123 118 208 169	These look like fungi growing, I hope that's not anywhere close by me.
169	130 117 156 83 19 115 200 63 112 87 169	hoping no one crashes here
169	136 4 26 124 123 202 36 54 203 144 169	If these people aren't allowed in, what did they do? Are they dangerous?
169	52 140 156 173 93 142 36 26 41 2 169	I hope this ferry takes me to Puget Sound.
169	23 137 167 39 101 110 143 29 201 21 169	The repair crew has arrived, but how long will it take?
169	128 184 23 205 67 27 82 92 190 150 169	Scary! I wouldn't try that
170	184 103 59 17 20 98 204 36 13 23 170	This looks like a dinner party my mom would go to.
170	24 67 122 14 62 25 96 93 38 65 170	I remember when I used to love stuff like this when I was a kid!
170	171 2 17 148 116 96 14 167 163 59 170	This pasture is very beautiful and lovely
170	60 124 140 6 151 110 88 11 111 99 170	This brings back such great memories, how nostalgic!
170	161 83 22 195 205 111 82 18 81 28 170	They're having so much fun with dress up!!
170	214 151 213 192 156 65 106 69 90 58 170	Those people look so young!
170	161 12 163 124 52 56 210 107 66 205 170	This reminds me of something i once saw
170	203 130 72 45 163 90 68 17 158 200 170	I love disneyland so much!!!
170	211 169 181 197 146 2 78 110 151 131 170	I remember when I was a young whippersnapper...used to do parkour and get all the ladies...now I just sit at the edge and wonder if I should jump.
170	64 6 99 198 116 140 75 145 36 187 170	What an amazing cathedral - would love to see it during my gap year travels.
170	77 106 168 169 119 206 215 6 108 31 170	These ladies are old but young at heart.
170	52 121 199 152 145 34 26 9 171 166 170	A fixer-upper with the urban factory feel.
170	150 211 169 111 207 201 56 7 6 71 170	What fun they're having in the mosh
170	145 193 207 122 134 101 123 186 6 80 170	The beautiful hair coloring and childish pose shows the girlish charm from within.
170	128 173 203 56 151 19 154 152 171 95 170	I always love to grab a latté and snack on my way to the train!
170	187 133 45 84 102 72 186 155 209 198 170	I just love getting out there and playing team sports in school.
170	138 55 189 49 85 21 166 207 182 3 170	THE FOREIGN WOMEN'S ARE DRINKING SOME ONE  LIQUID ITEM
170	30 51 204 131 138 194 52 91 6 176 170	These are definitely not mom jeans!
170	6 191 52 89 179 25 127 167 207 107 170	This road is long
170	160 8 178 137 90 110 128 74 124 68 170	To be young again and out partying
170	68 21 196 126 72 3 70 16 59 89 170	I love drinking coffee. It's my new favorite thing.
170	110 24 42 43 190 39 10 16 29 7 170	The forest is youthful
170	81 176 130 87 29 52 73 77 163 144 170	I visited here when I was 4 years old.
170	112 183 102 135 32 28 117 35 190 140 170	I wish I was old enough to sail down here
170	128 45 63 16 112 58 211 28 156 33 170	I want to hit it and make the water come out!
170	192 50 158 171 116 173 96 67 178 9 170	I want to jump right into this water, and just yell as I do!
170	107 19 191 61 137 25 138 5 149 103 170	The buildings are brightly colored and new.
170	134 69 73 15 174 90 182 85 215 106 170	Someone has bounded through the pristine snow, making tracks in a zig-zag fashion.
170	175 132 65 67 114 21 130 196 102 56 170	I would love to hike that mountain!
170	66 207 133 43 110 182 89 116 215 135 170	spirited free loose
170	190 155 173 208 199 113 107 194 69 151 170	fun feeding the geese

170	154 62 178 69 150 172 57 116 30 200 170	We are at the zoo, taking pictures and enjoying some snacks before we see more animals.
170	208 187 28 174 118 103 207 206 196 22 170	Looks like a great time with friends out on the field :)
170	78 2 62 68 37 87 111 161 115 33 170	Say cheese!
170	47 134 10 128 3 85 161 209 149 54 170	This reminds me of going on a cruise when I was a child. So pretty.
170	140 63 158 165 86 112 17 11 10 99 170	I'm glad that I'll be here for the future technology like this.
170	9 92 113 76 149 158 109 95 14 53 170	I could just spend an hour seeing what turns what.
170	69 87 176 206 158 109 185 201 137 1 170	It says TOM!
170	56 102 58 61 96 150 88 59 148 35 170	I am young, I am free, now hear me sing.
170	213 9 123 153 140 179 105 134 51 77 170	The blue wall makes me feel young and energized.

170	20 156 147 45 81 110 24 50 209 128 170	One could sure have fun playing a game of tag in this field.

170	132 86 10 171 101 98 161 53 152 11 170	It looks like it is old and ready to die, who wants to look at old flowers?
170	206 196 134 189 133 188 166 83 106 61 170	This reminds me of when I was young.

170	93 158 115 134 17 209 62 126 60 188 170	Are they going to throw any candy?  I hope they have jawbreakers.
170	101 77 120 118 57 209 86 81 187 105 170	What an old iMac!
170	200 172 111 158 59 39 203 128 135 60 170	Nothing like some Irish Whiskey to make me feel like a young lad again.
170	177 61 146 40 60 184 24 199 119 172 170	Wow!!! What a great day, I can't wait to see everyone again soon!
170	160 34 193 3 192 64 100 60 183 159 170	I could run all around this fort faster than a race horse.
170	64 197 152 18 167 120 187 196 93 22 170	I think that the young people should get out an make a difference.
170	155 23 80 140 2 141 45 18 138 166 170	this would be a great color for a race car

170	15 183 10 68 108 104 81 140 100 121 170	I want to run on the ground like I have no worries and am more carefree than ever
170	155 23 17 36 167 63 51 69 124 153 170	Awesome!!!!!!!!!!! I thought at first these were some action figure type toys :)
170	202 97 115 3 112 157 69 150 147 192 170	Dark colors give me energy.
170	54 108 124 107 198 102 66 112 215 205 170	What an awesome trail!
170	22 10 94 58 125 213 43 186 111 6 170	In playground with my dad
170	121 192 114 206 3 160 12 103 53 184 170	i love black hat when i was young
170	27 212 48 185 10 47 159 73 86 123 170	Fashionable shoes in a variety!
170	80 102 27 42 1 146 79 83 197 116 170	Somewhere to bike
171	98 28 18 38 106 139 83 147 108 19 171	It's good the gate is closed, that will help keep people out.
171	92 132 129 101 120 54 98 211 33 48 171	These people are taking up too much space and should be told they're being rude.
171	204 56 71 8 79 83 132 208 16 190 171	This pink box is very straight.
171	137 126 187 68 185 121 172 143 159 115 171	The animal hunts its prey with a cautious and careful nature.
171	213 175 105 54 99 29 157 25 128 34 171	There is danger in going in water this cold.
171	134 98 136 46 179 201 114 31 119 48 171	He is skilled
171	60 196 19 155 106 50 68 26 157 197 171	I hope they have a good marriage.
171	87 101 119 25 178 98 202 122 125 150 171	They better keep that grass cut down to 1/4" from the ground.
171	70 39 156 117 186 23 127 149 151 87 171	Is this a park? Are they enjoying it?
171	67 12 84 98 105 119 122 102 214 109 171	I think this lady is very serious about her art.
171	48 206 97 106 201 130 198 11 129 25 171	That necklace was probably a gift handed down though her family's generations.
171	148 28 15 130 110 48 170 80 127 108 171	Hope they took care of the poor who slept here before, and didn't just arrest them. It's not right the way people are treated.
171	121 9 185 71 145 14 109 6 21 184 171	Some people have too much fun.
171	108 176 142 213 87 199 85 154 195 20 171	Looks too crowded to get around
171	25 51 23 35 78 155 180 18 119 67 171	He's staring us down!
171	59 133 148 74 40 122 211 186 73 192 171	The church needs painting
171	127 85 93 69 9 32 154 4 46 182 171	Thousands gathered to witness the unveiling of a new era of automobile.
171	61 153 130 28 51 78 189 193 77 64 171	The game of hockey is one to be played seriously, that man should get up as quickly as possible
171	57 110 213 121 72 169 1 210 172 140 171	A green screen.
171	4 164 70 161 67 203 192 71 23 59 171	Excited to get my bike tuned up and ready for summer. Ready to hit the trails.
171	53 160 13 41 38 101 30 153 32 112 171	This is the front of a building.
171	93 195 54 88 84 14 51 212 140 61 171	Where was this taken? The buildings seem so old. I would like to visit this place.
171	214 96 172 108 85 17 39 127 62 184 171	A person with social anxiety would not like this place, it is full of people
171	117 120 64 133 45 27 70 144 97 141 171	This guy's focus is great!!
171	140 57 93 112 16 178 44 90 117 17 171	Many buildings are shown
171	103 27 213 14 182 193 40 205 121 140 171	DON'T GET HIS SHOES DIRTY
171	52 201 140 14 115 21 110 169 179 67 171	The players are very compose
171	81 128 164 203 201 22 150 151 162 40 171	This is clearly a cultural hub for the city, hopefully it is well protected.
171	158 59 5 153 143 95 82 206 184 27 171	It is very focus
171	98 203 45 185 90 23 167 210 16 173 171	They're very well dressed for the event.
171	4 71 49 57 112 154 91 44 139 156 171	This is something utterly precious in the world.
171	93 135 172 99 113 148 165 78 60 158 171	I really like the color of this car, makes it totally worth the money.
171	111 33 102 190 77 147 90 89 113 183 171	the man is serious
171	54 75 34 48 145 56 120 180 206 46 171	No one was allowed in!
171	44 213 32 74 164 150 131 146 96 126 171	The Chapel really should have a dress code.
171	54 1 141 9 36 163 177 114 19 126 171	The dancers in the parade are dressed exotically and are performing under strict supervision of the local police department.
171	84 125 159 36 145 69 177 152 140 94 171	Trust me, they are mother and daughter.
171	208 92 4 18 195 106 78 198 52 22 171	the need of science of technology increases as population grow
171	143 105 73 86 26 28 9 7 75 159 171	Looks like a fun place, but people don't know the horrors that took place on this beach 75 years ago.
171	118 167 57 92 42 76 39 147 104 124 171	This street needs to be redone.
171	101 163 77 13 61 200 194 114 145 167 171	I'm not sure if this is the best place for this device.
171	164 201 17 210 71 163 80 68 133 1 171	Robots can be trained to pick up colored blocks.  Can they be trained to aid in household tasks?
171	34 51 49 160 113 93 104 2 101 98 171	I find this routine so serious.
171	107 147 46 63 206 172 173 142 95 139 171	This needs to be taken seriously by tourists.
171	180 20 101 160 10 3 61 99 115 46 171	That is on big eye ball.
171	175 181 95 19 127 7 196 16 202 18 171	ok, please rotate the picture
171	43 54 151 37 157 130 168 15 20 57 171	That brick building looks like it was made a long time ago.
171	47 130 212 54 174 189 37 76 142 196 171	The horse was overworked and should NOT be walking in the parade
171	207 120 211 192 68 64 94 137 27 214 171	you have to make sure you connect the right cords to eathother or you could get shocked or hurt or worse
171	77 85 52 119 74 151 167 141 23 187 171	The car is safety testing on the track.
171	81 167 111 57 52 179 153 139 45 108 171	The river could get flooded during the rainy season and cause serious hazards
171	139 40 205 27 4 180 195 100 161 177 171	The plant can injure
171	160 148 8 145 177 46 206 135 91 55 171	She takes stretching seriously to prevent injury.
171	143 20 181 15 116 211 170 88 208 36 171	What is this?
171	205 175 18 38 112 26 204 1 181 214 171	Did you really mean it when said you were going to see the movie?
171	179 164 177 29 194 6 149 146 209 166 171	What beautiful scenery.
171	36 178 203 128 16 82 91 211 21 119 171	very intelligent personality
171	139 125 108 3 87 48 191 102 19 99 171	A very bleak and sober day
171	125 193 54 115 71 128 80 162 27 188 171	THIS GUY BELIEVES HE IS IN CHARGE.
171	124 130 146 19 159 13 87 188 68 115 171	Lots of work is getting done. Everyone is concerned about the project we are discussing.
171	88 9 175 156 119 82 24 7 39 85 171	that looks dangerous
171	74 126 28 133 170 34 147 120 3 173 171	If there's something wrong with the engine, that might take a while to fix.
171	165 99 46 102 143 169 60 22 214 116 171	They look like they are having a good time together.
171	137 204 20 97 86 28 168 120 15 107 171	why is this guy have his hands out like that
171	99 66 103 7 166 93 190 51 67 68 171	Metal is dangerous to our youth.
171	193 179 54 8 162 68 43 33 56 5 171	He looks like he is ready to play some hockey.
171	112 162 123 9 79 121 138 29 158 134 171	The dark lines of urban sprawl make me feel stern.
171	24 156 178 165 144 147 21 186 136 32 171	Looks like a storm's brewing.
171	97 19 61 11 145 190 53 127 214 25 171	I am not sure what that say, but I think it is a parade.
171	5 27 81 113 198 123 160 9 189 132 171	Lets change the scenery.
171	199 108 83 178 142 173 121 153 65 137 171	I wish I could see the ocean without thinking about global warming and pollution.
171	79 206 55 48 101 114 45 121 63 142 171	This is an example of how artistic randomness can be
171	29 31 182 157 25 202 209 190 81 27 171	Nice modern view.
171	86 2 154 66 192 131 99 167 102 204 171	Lets get this poerty night underway
171	188 117 158 2 157 8 215 68 187 28 171	These kids should focus on their food and eat faster
171	205 191 208 202 95 161 112 108 4 104 171	I think this color is awful.  It reminds me of not nice things.
171	92 40 10 43 197 2 139 99 110 157 171	thats a lot of people in there
171	178 59 57 37 71 198 54 80 215 30 171	These lights are very energy efficient
171	153 140 198 53 199 142 128 82 14 141 171	I often worry about my cat and his well-being when I am gone. He is getting older and I just want to make sure that he can manage on his own.
171	82 38 133 206 100 138 79 125 197 31 171	The house looks like a nice home
171	79 43 73 8 86 10 33 44 137 101 171	It's days like these that make commute seem awfully dreary.
171	10 80 164 140 71 136 43 98 197 23 171	Imagine how many generations of people have lived lives of joy and suffering in this place.
171	141 90 66 4 149 115 63 199 34 178 171	Are they serious with this view?
171	74 36 175 3 80 37 7 6 141 26 171	Thank goodness this is a true shop for vintage items.
171	110 43 210 135 62 17 137 113 85 136 171	The view looks daunting.
171	22 31 50 160 210 63 99 138 12 65 171	Focus to build and run this vehicle.
171	172 114 103 9 73 159 186 53 118 60 171	Looks like the grand canyon
171	66 15 50 2 181 205 32 108 69 142 171	Won't lend out my car without careful sonsideration
171	57 125 10 145 59 78 181 25 76 106 171	The sunlight fades into the neverending void.
171	198 129 8 57 12 206 97 117 61 121 171	I really want that dress
171	118 202 104 79 186 15 23 40 184 117 171	smart good better
171	48 186 96 88 133 3 5 97 54 193 171	I hope there a glass between his face and the insect.
171	160 65 136 114 10 99 121 111 116 7 171	This is about the clouds in the sky. I'm serious about this we need to take care of it.
171	215 5 94 159 129 131 36 199 73 99 171	This is a wooden house.

173	54 85 40 155 203 193 115 186 46 131 173	His white suit is not very flattering.

173	114 77 157 120 183 176 33 49 167 151 173	That really doesn't belong there.
173	169 187 178 144 94 24 171 70 99 1 173	Sometimes, the writing on the wall is just gibberish, some times its art.
173	209 154 69 46 47 201 143 14 133 38 173	She is taking a picture by the flower.

173	112 137 96 129 120 93 83 164 122 149 173	A steam engine making its way along the track.
173	37 64 118 143 176 198 67 149 123 188 173	Places like this do not interest me much
173	45 79 190 110 29 46 84 21 189 96 173	You really will like that food.

173	92 132 143 103 64 75 1 137 183 171 173	There's a band on the stage
173	101 44 25 154 50 34 153 94 85 157 173	The bare snow breaks up the composition

173	81 181 94 131 124 40 179 34 59 194 173	That is a advertisement for railing and fencing company.
173	184 206 139 142 124 55 47 110 183 188 173	I can't identify this color.

173	193 188 181 31 23 161 122 108 93 148 173	I do not have any feelings about this air show.
173	177 58 76 172 138 95 56 140 94 118 173	These bears are made of wood
173	213 206 110 59 112 107 65 80 118 85 173	That party looks boring.
173	201 29 146 19 52 116 96 92 119 25 173	That man is traveling.

173	33 189 48 83 163 167 184 153 73 137 173	The dandelion has a cold blue background.
173	146 15 151 26 103 201 6 5 25 149 173	The way these are lined up is boring, and monotonous. Not my style of photography!
173	114 132 131 165 205 204 47 19 45 16 173	THIS MEAL IS NO GOOD.
173	169 23 15 8 188 14 97 17 170 31 173	People riding horses.

173	144 56 99 115 27 98 93 48 201 128 173	That couple should not be in the street
173	68 91 135 53 129 7 171 133 81 8 173	She's wearing a tiara and gloves. It must be a special occasion of some sort.
173	29 9 94 183 56 160 16 168 76 181 173	The father should have helped
173	138 40 33 203 109 141 150 30 16 12 173	The railway tram owns that street and people better get out of the way when it is coming down the block.
173	38 133 83 189 87 9 49 159 207 158 173	I am bored!

174	9 22 64 44 80 1 137 56 45 42 174	Who puts a shirt on a stuffed animal?

174	20 56 104 117 29 126 161 38 31 60 174	I wonder what happens if you put your tongue on the electric wire.
174	77 60 153 98 118 23 210 161 12 22 174	Why is it painted a different color than the wall behind it?

174	157 58 202 169 191 110 130 88 151 3 174	This looks totally amazing, I have no clue what it is.
174	80 21 15 74 165 8 96 6 10 136 174	That's a weird looking tree, and the flowers doesn't look too good.
174	159 62 143 59 57 200 142 194 130 158 174	The Taj Mahal!  So pretty.

174	109 116 75 40 27 197 84 81 15 124 174	I wonder how long it took for someone to go and plant all the seeds on this mountain?
174	27 154 122 129 117 40 124 83 135 118 174	Um, where's your fur?

175	168 204 87 82 159 81 78 76 62 28 175	It's important that people are mindful about the environment to keep it looking so beautiful. That means no littering!
175	195 33 190 153 132 68 209 171 108 201 175	Is this shade to bright for you, if it is I can change it.
175	25 166 208 6 146 192 140 87 173 167 175	I know you've been overwhelmed lately, so why don't I babysit tonight?
175	25 23 39 124 35 205 61 190 84 156 175	Such cute ducklings, I hope they know where their dear mother is!
175	105 207 27 155 71 182 195 6 212 64 175	A very important event and she's on her phone.  It had to be really important.
175	46 63 162 69 108 37 180 72 211 153 175	That is so nice to leave the lights on for late arrivals.
175	202 135 180 110 43 64 120 69 166 124 175	What a beautiful view, too bad more people can't see it this way.
175	23 149 34 18 135 203 140 115 123 77 175	This place needs a little cleanup.
175	2 194 202 81 213 190 61 214 170 30 175	I would be considerate to be here.
175	38 173 53 169 4 95 56 85 157 192 175	I wish someone would help his out.  He looks like he's struggling.
175	106 166 112 40 134 125 172 137 147 136 175	A considerate conversation
175	173 43 139 206 75 113 210 150 202 129 175	He must be proud to have reached this high.
175	150 77 168 63 126 155 33 61 28 66 175	Given all that he went through to get here, Chip is looking pretty calm.
175	111 44 189 206 28 170 54 134 146 5 175	I treat him this drink.
175	134 16 78 115 158 187 209 165 195 153 175	I could see their view
175	170 81 80 12 97 10 4 101 2 105 175	I like how the doors are unencumbered.
175	70 118 213 170 101 77 1 76 195 178 175	loving, gentle, lonely
175	152 61 64 21 56 103 16 168 18 76 175	I will always let a lady take a seat on the underground over myself (I'm a dude)
175	162 187 119 190 132 185 38 71 18 195 175	it read to me of in front people let would I
175	75 114 129 200 21 111 161 83 20 64 175	The lush vegetation surround the beautiful pond.
175	29 66 60 15 148 183 184 211 57 182 175	I really thing I could make this design into pot holders
175	197 169 47 66 214 90 93 195 201 167 175	The lady's sign is very well made.
175	194 158 160 129 124 89 91 83 180 32 175	The architect did a good job on this.
175	211 205 202 114 174 179 12 32 70 163 175	I hope he's not too uncomfortable.
175	208 17 108 87 6 31 133 197 44 85 175	This color reminds me of a sweater my grandma used to wear, I miss her so much.
175	3 86 198 54 70 149 140 209 170 186 175	I am going to call someone to see it they can help

175	169 72 146 42 23 123 110 96 26 132 175	Kind reminder to light outside lights by sundown.
175	204 143 195 142 154 105 164 160 54 85 175	He looks a little nervous
175	10 152 29 13 41 127 104 203 128 213 175	I wish I was able to help them with their boat.
175	99 213 27 186 55 125 24 47 120 50 175	Wow! I hope those fireworks don't wake up any children.
175	214 71 150 96 48 127 186 80 117 213 175	Is it tangled?  I bet it plays pretty music.
175	24 17 34 20 140 144 191 50 51 59 175	I appreciate the effort that went into creating that meal!
175	144 84 70 151 37 57 173 81 199 204 175	Perhaps there could be some barricades or officers to protect the safety of the people there.
175	183 6 150 184 104 65 95 87 134 194 175	it is considerate to bring it home
175	144 50 142 1 104 70 75 167 18 20 175	THey are looking out for each other, this is the way I would act too
175	144 204 162 75 148 215 211 160 121 47 175	I always pick up my trash when I visit here
175	199 115 92 67 79 29 100 9 7 108 175	I wonder who's phones are these
175	214 54 29 180 30 57 40 95 27 108 175	We should leave the salamander alone in peace. Do not bother it.
175	127 96 184 74 209 3 112 14 7 178 175	I wish you had a beach like us
175	97 187 197 35 111 179 1 108 62 38 175	What a quaint, nice little town.
175	100 86 186 25 26 128 109 92 96 202 175	It looks like they are drinking, I hope they have a designated driver.
175	170 208 1 132 198 85 149 59 146 92 175	That pond should be fixed
175	86 182 89 130 195 191 107 207 53 200 175	Please don't stare at him for too long. It hurts his feelings.
175	148 70 209 100 166 144 200 126 111 17 175	They were nice in the picture.
175	56 207 186 105 65 25 47 59 149 51 175	The loads on their neck are too much
175	110 80 121 211 71 141 190 133 196 78 175	The ocean is our precious resource treat it well.
175	97 187 67 8 126 214 183 77 193 154 175	This guy looks like he might be a talented DJ
175	74 63 110 109 77 53 116 189 162 79 175	It is important for young kids to practice and have discipline.
175	113 173 46 138 23 162 26 6 67 172 175	The man should be careful not to fall
175	124 9 101 7 48 55 97 51 103 75 175	The perfect spot for my sweetie and I.
175	61 118 51 109 158 89 188 42 155 72 175	I'd love to give a friend or family member a car like this.
175	46 64 97 150 203 139 56 155 30 115 175	The place is abandoned
175	119 45 29 169 69 199 66 113 159 53 175	I would help them move
175	8 94 52 81 33 211 192 9 152 115 175	Lets take a solo pic
175	129 111 118 156 41 23 49 31 132 8 175	We should do all we can to keep those trees growing.
175	5 25 88 207 183 150 21 40 64 45 175	I wouldn't stand in the center too long. Everyone needs to be able to see this great view.
175	65 7 208 43 119 184 51 95 127 114 175	This man needs to sit
175	41 4 110 159 73 3 31 204 207 173 175	Before the grand race, and ready to prove women can win!
175	109 120 168 139 198 204 170 122 91 164 175	THANKS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THE FISH.
175	84 30 178 58 114 82 106 159 7 105 175	Better safe than sorry.
175	196 129 136 52 211 177 192 98 37 66 175	This looks like a nice little city to visit.
175	55 19 138 182 194 78 24 163 61 195 175	He looks hot and tired, poor guy.
175	93 45 168 174 34 130 63 14 52 214 175	This neighbor hood looks considerate
175	29 122 30 22 117 5 41 56 103 98 175	We remember, never forget.
175	53 145 15 85 127 62 173 79 64 26 175	What a cute little man
175	164 2 16 4 26 179 84 213 47 122 175	Is it okay to talk if we whisper?
175	103 177 205 68 94 27 23 110 19 5 175	What a beautiful image
175	108 31 141 153 207 105 38 191 46 139 175	this food looks delicious in my opinion
175	70 28 144 17 1 150 65 184 4 209 175	While some may see old and rusted, I see a story to be told with a rich history behind such a lovely object.
175	200 180 211 174 3 195 39 210 120 2 175	What a lovely rainbow, it just came to brighten all our days
175	164 127 186 138 201 81 83 114 124 151 175	The did wonderful lighting in these two rooms, we are grateful to have been able to stay here
175	207 84 72 59 194 66 159 212 4 24 175	Maybe we should give him a fan.
175	122 151 152 127 13 71 202 198 155 57 175	I wonder where his mother is!?
175	189 169 148 92 5 46 194 149 69 22 175	the flowers are dry and the plants need to be watered
175	2 177 57 66 71 176 202 11 132 68 175	A small struggling town
175	100 212 45 76 33 205 130 167 177 14 175	If they are camping they better make sure their fires are all extinguised before they leave.
175	15 210 121 21 54 49 32 163 45 206 175	I am going to try to help him move the boats back inside the storage unit tonight.
175	25 115 181 40 160 88 29 112 149 198 175	I wonder what the size of those small islands are?
176	110 120 187 179 39 119 94 195 186 30 176	The building may collapse.
176	185 86 116 129 75 31 203 162 83 112 176	I hope nothing bad happens to the people.
176	6 69 160 171 28 157 142 44 93 25 176	This gang looks scary.
176	138 103 14 21 158 13 89 196 150 147 176	Our tour guide could easily strand us on the island, we should go back now.
176	108 182 63 145 189 179 9 109 110 84 176	Another beautiful day
176	92 78 18 20 163 133 184 208 141 112 176	I don't like this building, it gives me the creeps!
176	36 104 50 214 83 96 97 46 205 10 176	I hope he doesn't choke
176	138 30 136 27 211 189 99 149 61 151 176	I hope they're all ok
176	157 133 166 113 121 53 127 80 204 119 176	Being on a rocky boat is so unstable.
176	68 212 137 139 50 174 180 74 77 148 176	Be careful dont fall
176	48 133 89 121 12 19 73 62 80 3 176	I am afraid to eat crawfish.
176	75 48 46 3 2 121 34 111 112 65 176	Where does that lead
176	120 12 141 152 61 53 163 30 206 107 176	I hope no one is around that corner?
176	146 129 41 143 122 23 22 132 49 77 176	If she keeps leaning on that it could break and she could fall.
176	74 140 58 121 142 110 184 72 81 31 176	AAAHHHH Oh I thought they were pigeon! Phew
176	2 111 157 208 159 164 39 27 55 107 176	Oh, no, what could this mean?
176	127 73 210 196 78 171 179 208 97 203 176	The bright light reminds me of an interrogation where I am trying to hide something and the questioners see right through me
176	12 160 188 50 152 136 14 124 151 100 176	I am terrified to raise a little girl like this in such a terrible world.
176	44 124 125 40 132 97 14 152 30 91 176	I hope that bag is not full of dead animals.
176	13 175 136 71 178 150 206 186 11 157 176	I'm scared for this guy.
176	68 39 48 154 77 54 26 190 211 20 176	how's the details so big for such a small monkey
176	130 108 8 166 95 204 199 15 191 112 176	I don't want to be in that huddle.
176	4 126 208 113 28 136 65 32 110 23 176	I hope he doesn't knock over the statue.
176	48 39 100 132 144 137 11 37 51 35 176	I hope he doesn't fall and get hurt!
176	205 55 106 147 193 197 56 195 199 146 176	That light looks hot and dangerous!
176	160 191 6 144 134 143 102 60 39 25 176	I hope nothing goes wrong with my wedding.
176	91 118 22 52 24 141 68 180 67 163 176	I don't like that pick-up sitting in wait outside an ice-cream store.
176	22 14 71 38 214 85 213 170 113 198 176	The eerie looking sky looks very dangerous and is causing me to worry,.
176	6 5 153 131 177 199 195 148 128 130 176	I don't know what to do on these lines and they make me scared.
176	5 14 46 141 80 60 105 16 70 192 176	Never walk up to a zebra from behind! Like this one, he could charge you if you scare him!
176	206 146 112 128 133 208 55 153 120 39 176	I don't want to get bucked with one of those.
176	118 61 91 162 56 120 127 87 72 208 176	i alway wanted to find that one like they have but life is flashing before my eyes
176	132 91 184 163 124 166 161 51 169 210 176	Hopefully they are parked.
176	53 77 9 144 214 86 108 6 210 74 176	Not sure I'd want to be out there at night.
176	177 143 16 46 83 125 29 20 106 195 176	This is so pretty I hope it doesn't rain and ruin it.
176	68 192 23 200 90 112 178 94 136 2 176	I think those are poisonous
176	96 78 20 205 183 133 67 39 74 47 176	I can't believe I am hearing this.
176	34 187 192 31 152 155 4 178 95 84 176	I cant cross the road here
176	75 138 150 102 12 209 188 118 11 106 176	Oh tenis ball please do not hit me again.
176	105 165 109 148 154 11 25 14 82 48 176	I wouldn't like this building with lightning striking close by.
176	181 48 65 37 42 61 3 22 13 109 176	Oh dear, he looks exhausted! Hope he got a lot of rest after this.
176	153 87 152 110 213 124 81 28 84 47 176	I hate looking at blank windows.
176	27 103 169 46 179 119 199 106 3 86 176	Hope he doesn't run out of oxygen.
176	134 130 156 42 34 80 209 177 7 72 176	I am afraid these people are in trouble
176	73 212 35 5 155 213 177 131 76 71 176	I wouldn't want to live there, may fall off a cliff.
176	82 14 149 173 58 99 56 212 28 134 176	yea that music is too loug
176	201 214 173 64 119 170 33 130 169 18 176	I am afraid of height
176	179 17 127 197 195 29 189 47 71 25 176	I'm afraid of bridges
176	65 178 145 24 124 174 142 79 175 110 176	I cant paint wall like this
176	91 196 87 94 79 58 210 86 169 83 176	This church looks so tall and stern I'd be scared to go inside.
176	182 77 214 119 130 57 196 55 101 54 176	these 3 gentlemen look like they are ready to take on the world almost seem fearful to others competitors
176	73 175 203 153 188 40 125 54 201 20 176	I don't think it's a safe color
176	188 147 196 197 205 29 35 71 150 20 176	This looks like a scary meeting
176	32 6 34 157 171 95 213 142 209 135 176	THIS COLOR INDICATES EVIL AND FEAR.
176	190 153 156 166 186 125 24 17 198 170 176	Ah! Don't hurt yourself!
176	46 203 199 211 109 207 47 151 170 131 176	That looks expensive!
176	174 126 113 148 139 172 54 214 188 195 176	I think the cars are going too fast.
176	56 198 136 173 38 46 89 87 12 51 176	How are they doing this?
176	18 131 2 108 15 156 81 89 195 26 176	I'm really afraid to cross this street because you know how crazy traffic can get.
176	158 120 95 126 177 87 113 129 90 139 176	This animal looks like a lion
176	65 99 175 185 121 60 27 170 15 106 176	Be careful, it's kind of high up there!
176	119 14 90 39 31 104 106 203 173 85 176	Big cathedrals like this make me think of all the exploited people and how many people are controlled through religion
176	168 177 206 104 19 161 136 124 37 41 176	I think I may not understand anything about this panel.
176	63 133 106 56 71 123 121 156 166 138 176	Oh gosh! Those rocks and snow look like a disaster waiting to happen!
176	129 183 127 105 197 16 48 76 108 134 176	I don't think this vehicle is safe to drive.
176	183 30 187 88 160 145 162 167 31 60 176	id be scared to stand on that rock
176	51 164 205 12 148 9 111 166 192 129 176	Those mountains must have a lot of bears!
176	76 195 144 101 98 210 3 196 65 193 176	Too intense and scary for me.
176	77 211 27 146 76 145 80 105 72 103 176	I can't believe this is where our country is headed.
176	11 12 99 122 49 29 101 110 209 77 176	i dread death
176	194 83 131 113 164 5 26 74 16 6 176	What's coming for me
176	106 141 135 16 82 29 56 44 192 24 176	I don't like what I can't see
176	38 142 124 174 43 99 134 22 53 113 176	This is an stiff meal very low interset form the above the angle
176	32 6 145 205 44 212 201 168 162 150 176	THERE IS A SUPER POISONOUS SPIDER THERE
176	123 22 60 8 155 173 61 68 109 23 176	His gaze fills me with dread.
176	44 200 22 89 142 61 143 80 156 101 176	I preferred the other company, so I am a bit worried about the quality of this new one.
176	88 134 197 126 143 121 71 84 67 56 176	I AM SO WORRIED ABOUT THIS FULL MOON MAKING PEOPLE SCARED
176	51 16 161 32 159 42 107 53 48 198 176	I feel like I am about to be attacked by pods.
176	98 205 34 121 157 128 110 130 10 103 176	I am so afraid that he will see us here
176	198 26 196 17 199 164 79 180 117 139 176	I hope there is an adult with that boy, it looks like there could be dangerous crocodiles around there.
176	51 210 182 118 45 14 215 28 105 76 176	It's scary to think about some of the most beautiful places on earth can be negatively effected by humans.
176	113 84 5 36 129 189 22 161 214 23 176	This train goes far too fast
176	215 78 205 40 76 45 75 14 50 3 176	I can't describe what it is but something about this pattern shakes me to my core. Something bad is coming. I'm sure of it.
176	213 72 114 5 50 190 99 37 67 13 176	This storm looks fearful. The weather will be terrible today.
176	105 24 168 213 149 17 77 50 19 201 176	Is this dog meat?
176	115 178 23 214 92 68 151 199 54 135 176	Eek! I would be scared if I had to repair that roof!
176	87 20 39 147 136 32 162 122 65 211 176	I wonde3r who's lurking behind that corner.
176	61 76 193 141 158 110 166 26 92 143 176	I would be terrified to see these three on the streets.
176	112 21 76 113 167 188 152 43 54 117 176	I am scared of sitting in the front row of a race.
176	167 165 33 104 94 189 168 31 187 27 176	Is there a shadow behind them?  I hope it doesn't get them!
176	111 147 102 97 203 1 179 199 55 146 176	I'm worried he's going to fall down the stairs.
176	145 11 80 154 65 41 109 108 103 98 176	this looks scary
176	28 62 10 171 38 95 163 137 96 197 176	I bet that is a bomb
176	26 25 205 52 10 190 109 21 46 96 176	They say this building is haunted I dont want to go in there.
177	180 176 69 211 132 108 94 129 98 14 177	It's a weird looking canary.
177	125 142 122 80 97 77 113 116 133 105 177	I have heard outrageous stories about this book, I must buy it!
177	175 160 215 150 131 169 187 102 180 71 177	Wooden boat. Would it float? I need to see.
177	197 142 136 143 101 167 72 83 85 176 177	These graves should be maintained! The nation's fallen should be honored!
177	8 199 93 163 68 115 35 20 134 138 177	Cats are the worst!
177	140 23 98 121 83 107 19 180 9 94 177	I don't think I would bother to get in there with the horses and less I felt like getting kicked!
177	143 2 157 84 197 18 92 124 129 152 177	Such great, amazing shades of greeen.
177	6 72 38 73 76 135 59 12 93 166 177	Remember last year? they were so many trees, look at it now, nothing!
177	182 100 80 183 118 145 152 43 54 97 177	It looks like everyone is doing a Nazi salute at the performer, never should that be acceptable!
177	171 180 51 77 31 86 92 158 132 7 177	the crown does not fit the person
177	138 122 152 108 62 180 110 173 28 115 177	I used to have a stuffed version of those, I had the guy stuff it then I didn't pay him! Ha!
177	67 210 105 33 194 192 61 175 102 131 177	Friends show smile
177	210 56 182 47 17 61 48 120 152 207 177	I have a crazy idea about destroying this party.
177	22 103 21 72 195 196 16 162 98 143 177	that is a crazy looking flower
177	43 55 31 49 42 183 104 82 58 206 177	Why in the world would anyone want a computer box printed on their t-shirt!
177	162 21 159 93 74 78 121 63 210 36 177	That is a great picture!
177	190 16 119 117 159 178 136 203 56 153 177	Are you kidding me!? The filter on this picture is COMPLETELY washed out!
177	23 5 45 183 19 66 122 162 12 36 177	I would start a mosh pit at that concert
177	110 35 62 13 127 196 94 123 8 85 177	I painted this sign yesterday!
177	127 55 23 92 115 82 208 42 102 65 177	This is so uncalled for!!
177	163 133 16 199 175 99 51 124 171 128 177	RED CRANE! BLUE CRANE! 2 CRANE! GREEN BOAT!
177	176 55 113 21 29 150 170 45 212 204 177	You have to wonder if those robots on the right will be all of our doctors in the next year!
177	208 164 188 82 158 182 29 62 45 27 177	Oh my GOD! You all look fabulous. YOU ARE THE BEST EVER!!!
177	53 6 135 80 194 181 127 131 109 116 177	It is horrbile and outrageous that the lighting in was so bad it cast shadows on the background. Need better lighting.
177	136 131 10 41 172 114 34 185 184 151 177	Its pretty but the price here s outrageous.
177	161 142 104 49 205 208 6 172 27 133 177	Nobody is watching them
177	52 171 89 209 178 162 179 60 142 133 177	Whoah, they almost look like aliens! I wonder what kind of crazy old tradition this is or if they'll do any weird dances and rituals!
177	10 26 47 161 5 118 109 150 210 80 177	Pie always tastes best after it's been smashed into your face. It's science!
177	31 92 138 211 123 90 44 32 70 14 177	I never knew rivers could have mud like that
177	210 63 179 209 48 107 90 129 87 14 177	I told the man that it would be Five hundred dollars for my pure white arrowhead.
177	183 161 135 92 103 148 205 192 44 140 177	The bed is too white
177	105 179 2 65 68 136 129 112 120 66 177	That building looks great and the curve is crazy.
177	14 174 168 106 210 90 167 115 49 50 177	It is shocking they are charging this much.
177	36 42 105 209 59 141 24 131 212 200 177	I can't believe this house costs so much! Look how small it is!
177	83 106 148 145 100 44 135 34 23 169 177	This is ridiculous... We really need to do something about this!
177	54 201 27 3 180 202 168 10 149 108 177	what it with those gang signs mister.
177	52 55 160 43 107 165 69 54 98 115 177	This is the hottest lake in the world!
177	6 121 100 90 200 126 33 168 81 101 177	Dessert was FABULOUS-O! BEST EVAH!
177	180 110 108 115 16 112 83 77 127 26 177	I can't tell what is that animal under the water? It looks like the arm of a giant grizzly bear who is about to reach up and grab the photographer!
177	5 12 214 128 86 68 4 184 35 167 177	Its outrageous of how much space there is.
177	32 17 94 59 20 89 56 211 67 140 177	I know! Let's take the building on the right and stack it atop the other one, to get one REALLY TALL ONE!
177	8 82 100 190 24 132 33 123 70 126 177	No one could believe he really finished running.
177	32 33 11 165 103 81 127 175 131 23 177	Looks like the perfect opportunity to jump in the car and see how fast it can go!
177	33 49 19 59 178 130 147 23 16 103 177	A massive castle, with an enormous amount of people waiting in line to see it. I would think these people would have something better to do with their time.
177	57 121 190 69 11 107 207 51 26 182 177	Get a closer shot of the screen, come on!
177	9 58 138 205 172 128 4 181 146 104 177	The girls were so astounded that the event was canceled that they all smiled in an outrageous unison.
177	2 65 38 8 171 60 112 93 199 99 177	What a beautiful picture of the White House!
177	7 77 65 179 61 58 45 20 27 25 177	I would love to run all through those mountains! Up and down and all around.
177	83 89 27 64 59 8 186 48 136 101 177	Bet this group is going to have a party night!
177	120 43 186 171 10 144 87 202 94 117 177	This craftsmanship is just so average.
177	138 21 60 205 207 47 38 147 25 102 177	THIS FIGHT IS RIDICULOUSLY UNCALLED FOR
177	62 24 90 82 41 33 22 142 125 154 177	They ruined the landscape of the photo with that tall pine in the foreground on the right.
177	66 196 59 170 40 24 29 23 16 118 177	At least he left the rest of the Deer at home.
177	35 203 170 92 102 3 90 114 126 208 177	Everyone has red/white tracksuits but me? Where is mine?!
177	138 209 211 155 140 199 8 153 25 37 177	Oh my goodness, what is that loon with the dunce cap doing??  And that robe!  What on earth?  I need more information on this story.
177	210 92 79 142 117 176 50 130 33 13 177	The man's smile is not genuine
177	47 148 127 64 186 49 156 67 196 50 177	Wow! They really think they can all cross the walkway in under 13 seconds?
177	193 119 146 41 195 39 205 128 142 117 177	This is LITERALLY the best printer in the world, it even prints gold!
177	108 70 195 202 179 40 185 128 209 27 177	This must take a lot of stamina.
177	77 20 102 46 117 116 178 26 105 74 177	I wore the exact same outfit to work this morning.
177	164 156 15 207 166 172 96 117 133 203 177	Unbelievable stuff! I can't imagine being within arm's left of such a majestic creature!
177	104 28 170 183 172 138 80 98 33 68 177	Just eat the ice cream already! I am hungry.
177	105 205 89 110 141 48 135 159 151 64 177	The patch of grass is totally ruining the walkway around it! Awful.
177	202 124 7 198 140 46 113 91 196 212 177	Wow that is a beautiful dress, but who is that next to her
177	102 37 53 168 74 46 187 98 65 71 177	This building is too busy! It should be torn down!
177	40 33 43 7 128 73 178 196 83 104 177	Wow i am so shocked at how high it is!
177	143 171 180 149 189 211 176 155 186 196 177	Why is this car so awesome!
177	110 50 86 116 151 181 43 92 28 114 177	The neighbor's zebra is back eating my lawn!
177	33 178 126 119 198 1 101 123 29 97 177	their age difference cause outrage.
177	66 17 89 25 32 136 12 16 102 29 177	They need more van
177	181 81 52 142 30 147 203 163 103 198 177	be calm and ahppy
177	57 172 37 82 112 212 169 128 97 28 177	The leaves are too small
177	135 185 76 117 21 149 195 47 130 175 177	This looks almost creepy, let's hope they aren't shooting anything too crazy with that camera because it doesn't look like a normal movie set.
177	20 147 67 59 44 55 110 9 203 25 177	This new home I am building will be the biggest and greatest on the block.
177	32 35 77 6 156 93 144 100 151 174 177	What a crazy stage layout! What the heck is that red X doing it's so distracting and it totally clashes with her outfit! OMG!
177	178 123 49 66 112 130 4 97 20 196 177	There's no way a tree could grow on a landscape like that! The camera must have the capability to see a mirage as it takes the photo!
177	111 39 13 3 68 163 150 96 146 122 177	Look at the oppulance of the wedding, disgusting.
177	16 34 84 189 160 27 194 52 42 140 177	That isn't even a cool scenery!
177	118 182 180 54 128 212 147 76 135 191 177	the color is red
177	21 92 209 183 25 112 125 17 20 88 177	Why can't I go water skiing? I don't care if the water is almost frozen.
177	190 73 211 18 42 142 56 59 46 76 177	I can't believe how someone could make a piece of art that bad. Just look at it.
177	147 208 41 180 150 25 113 174 112 129 177	I can't believe fish tails are a delicacy in some cultures. That's shocking !!
177	2 61 51 33 174 193 124 130 20 8 177	I can't believe that horse can pull that many people.
177	80 135 16 138 200 122 98 43 215 31 177	That boy's look could kill
177	97 25 15 198 75 79 120 143 88 56 177	Are you brothers? I mean you look like twins.
177	102 128 153 16 196 91 132 134 68 154 177	The man looks so happy he could cry!
177	38 87 189 84 157 163 28 181 171 94 177	You know what would be crazy? If one of those horses started riding the other horse.
177	50 190 127 202 5 87 162 117 68 193 177	is she supposed to be a mode or something?
177	30 111 165 116 13 183 21 215 127 15 177	How do those people make themselves blurry like that.
177	144 156 154 162 205 67 152 110 142 210 177	That is an outrageous amount of pink.
177	42 185 34 70 182 3 194 26 198 152 177	I would love to sky dive there!
177	120 31 8 100 111 10 51 71 130 185 177	These fireworks were out of this world tonight!
177	127 193 175 52 98 132 164 29 165 50 177	Banksy really gets around!
177	14 34 169 183 207 125 136 31 190 67 177	WOW! Look how much of that tree that bird ate!
178	149 156 189 151 198 185 44 69 148 10 178	Waiting for good horror show
178	68 150 13 91 117 185 190 210 25 103 178	What a nice boy
178	214 78 182 30 10 70 191 146 177 204 178	I always disliked disney
178	105 198 209 106 130 64 62 157 76 188 178	Such a careless set up.
178	164 214 159 78 177 42 2 14 173 104 178	I'm so tired of airplanes, balloons, blimps, and other sky-garbage ruining my view of the sky!
178	70 35 180 131 195 185 148 39 103 30 178	Any team that isn't the Orioles really grinds my gears.
178	94 111 8 19 207 174 159 113 191 180 178	Such creative displays make us human.
178	139 146 21 4 15 143 132 84 91 96 178	Bad sketch artist
178	93 104 39 147 68 172 142 211 129 167 178	the windy tent is annoying
178	59 47 100 93 166 71 189 37 196 66 178	I finally arrive and these guys are blocking my way...
178	93 102 14 80 137 40 79 41 94 139 178	ugh! why can't I read everything it says?!
178	161 68 128 112 30 198 197 14 107 120 178	This person has his fist in the way of a perfectly good photo.
178	76 44 98 206 203 24 132 136 131 52 178	The horse should stay behind the fence.
178	8 103 194 39 94 118 203 16 29 212 178	I would hate to have to listen to this.
178	78 152 105 69 138 96 204 127 200 91 178	Her voice is nothing like on the album.  Even her look needs work.
178	4 134 93 130 147 161 144 81 194 23 178	Food look nasty
178	115 41 158 157 141 181 114 78 83 4 178	Those clothes do not match at all.
178	161 122 32 28 63 25 17 214 154 115 178	So boring! If I wanted to see this crap I would've gone to the meeting.
178	213 37 89 17 93 69 72 175 151 51 178	I'm trying to sleep, Johnny! Can you flame on somewhere else please?
178	132 51 129 173 90 196 167 20 174 15 178	Can you smile anymore than that?
178	39 96 212 139 143 152 4 142 73 48 178	I really wish i was friggin' there right now! Life isn't fair!!
178	38 192 152 128 112 215 206 56 31 170 178	UGH! I despise these fisheye camera views.
178	127 136 128 86 59 129 52 152 51 193 178	I wonder if those bubbles mean there is a alligator in there ready to eat the photographer.
178	189 70 76 144 98 137 188 71 108 80 178	There's too many distracting lights.
178	79 158 57 86 61 70 92 150 5 7 178	I don't understand why they can't score tonight!!
178	29 38 68 89 91 3 198 215 17 43 178	Very distasteful to have trash on the flags.  It ruins everything.
178	98 15 143 13 114 175 23 20 17 99 178	Can you believe people left their trash on the table?
178	111 52 155 96 48 101 112 63 75 31 178	What are they doing to her?
178	88 6 139 112 92 157 59 26 14 25 178	It's called "dribbling," coach. Not "bouncy-wouncy."
178	73 133 181 81 201 27 69 207 132 154 178	What on earth am I looking at!!
178	168 171 90 71 79 146 102 118 73 203 178	WHY IS THE HILL so high to climb. This is going to hurt my legs !
178	120 199 168 67 154 4 71 192 6 49 178	this parking lot looks like it's flooded.  What a pain.
178	209 27 155 163 137 82 186 172 51 35 178	Why can't I read the sign!
178	25 173 201 196 152 88 180 214 128 103 178	I can't believe they would let a child sit there
178	70 200 177 11 120 184 91 99 188 5 178	The photographer couldn't get out of the reflection?
178	169 120 110 4 119 82 35 184 21 59 178	You should really lock that up better if you don't want it stolen.
178	113 192 42 18 159 117 74 166 108 57 178	ugh why did you take a picture of that
178	177 169 5 30 88 200 197 211 90 124 178	It's not in a hurry, so why does it need the flashing lights?
178	99 138 139 96 137 126 107 21 199 14 178	Why would you have a ladder there.
178	6 79 33 71 96 30 5 74 111 61 178	That runner's face is the same as mine when things don't go right!
178	133 130 75 156 101 27 87 23 58 64 178	ITS ANNOYING HOW RELIGION IS EVERYWHERE.
178	117 97 77 215 27 98 100 76 6 35 178	This irritates me quite a bit, do not like this at all!
178	212 88 59 14 205 61 169 204 91 76 178	The sound of trains is so annoying.
178	49 159 133 48 33 183 152 215 27 206 178	Man, why did I even bother coming.. these people are so annoying.
178	213 174 20 81 9 162 76 106 161 125 178	This waffle badly needs some syrup
178	203 17 213 105 95 202 125 27 138 36 178	Ugh, where are there no cars on the right hand side?
178	124 206 152 5 93 208 63 58 24 182 178	Cold dreary yucky day
178	118 1 185 184 119 155 65 198 159 98 178	Ugh, I hate these dumb pictures of the sun.
178	80 129 102 104 56 18 111 190 214 142 178	Why would someone take a picture of a pool? It's not interesting.
178	3 44 122 94 95 160 116 37 24 33 178	I have mice
178	137 203 215 92 22 7 13 21 26 50 178	The man cannot get the sleep he needs.
178	7 135 160 31 8 215 167 117 205 157 178	I get frustrated looking at this picture as I have no clue what it is
178	164 50 21 78 111 97 55 206 196 118 178	So many people here, they all got those looks. I need to get out of here before I get violent on anyone.
178	136 85 160 167 23 151 122 18 92 210 178	Those gates don't seem necessary..
178	11 56 99 118 60 120 23 111 206 135 178	Ugh! Looking at fungus makes me itch.
178	81 137 204 191 33 162 134 45 176 120 178	Eww mushrooms are disgusting.
178	201 131 83 44 87 154 105 82 208 99 178	I like the reflection, but have been telling them constantly to remove those trees.
178	197 126 205 18 166 92 191 30 162 90 178	It bugs me when people carry on in public like this.
178	165 203 60 133 54 87 151 46 95 106 178	the color blue annoys me
178	36 96 9 94 53 23 21 156 123 18 178	I bet that kid is going to cry about its snack.
178	131 109 15 211 170 36 172 78 135 175 178	Oh, that blue light is awful. It makes everything look bad. Who would even use that? I just don't get people sometimes.
178	72 191 121 71 96 197 91 179 182 153 178	Good lord this photo is terrible. I can't see anything. Ever heard of a flash?
178	4 158 118 81 62 144 155 79 76 13 178	Please fix that collar!
178	129 25 106 127 121 50 26 151 27 42 178	Pushing that cart would be horrible.
178	192 6 132 195 20 14 151 167 32 184 178	Her smile makes me feel annoyed.
178	37 125 30 8 172 126 99 94 186 215 178	I can't beleive they picked all those flowers
178	116 151 112 22 95 193 213 25 91 114 178	I wonder if he's saying anything interesting.
178	144 192 170 157 45 190 11 115 140 173 178	I'm tired to hear that piano music!!
178	16 156 64 26 143 106 31 215 39 123 178	Must every blank wall have some nasty graffiti on it?
178	86 144 65 31 188 193 112 126 169 142 178	The lines to go up in this thing are so long, it's not worth it.
178	171 92 119 15 205 102 214 190 204 97 178	Theres so much happening in this image that its annoying
178	77 158 132 68 114 194 195 122 48 43 178	Why do people think this lazy animal is so cute?
178	103 105 207 113 145 65 101 126 118 157 178	Makes me so angry when I see people doing graffiti like this in my town.
178	3 109 214 30 78 20 64 8 197 180 178	Ugh, I hate when waitresses lean into me like that.  So annoying!
178	90 124 59 156 167 69 58 211 85 107 178	I am so tired of these modern artists passing off a canvas with only one color as "art."
178	56 211 42 109 7 29 145 209 152 17 178	I really don't like that part of town.
178	118 141 124 91 112 193 139 207 187 46 178	Jeez, when will people learn not to eat wild berries
178	122 29 13 52 205 82 158 118 107 19 178	Being from America, I hate seeing the driver's wheel on the opposite side of the car... Doesn't make sense.
178	213 87 161 205 90 35 7 58 14 39 178	These mountains are so hot! Why are they always so hot!?
178	189 161 86 121 176 158 25 63 181 166 178	I do not like the way she is standing.
178	198 188 163 213 40 171 37 109 123 169 178	Public speaking is not my strong suit, not feeling very good today but I have these lovely people by my side.
178	60 21 65 142 162 197 145 154 41 40 178	How did that even get up there?? And who put it up there?
178	121 10 177 17 131 71 54 24 77 100 178	This kid is so annoying wearing pants with flip flops.
178	27 106 55 49 195 201 132 198 173 96 178	This is too revealing.
178	62 136 169 35 191 149 82 196 123 28 178	This irritates me
178	189 130 71 100 9 48 157 4 214 150 178	I absolutely hate this team!
178	44 42 9 132 122 110 18 102 78 116 178	that looks stupid, is that a manatee?
178	85 201 14 4 191 83 138 37 167 69 178	another dumb hipster
178	67 124 84 53 214 157 181 69 119 48 178	This guy needs to pay attention or else he's just wasting everyone's time.
178	17 166 126 144 104 174 215 196 168 200 178	they wanted this painting details
178	23 194 128 91 50 108 138 86 88 29 178	I am annoyed with how this photo doesn't appear to have a subject.
178	136 40 133 31 202 195 175 163 145 135 178	Oh look, another cyclist taking up the whole road.
178	209 107 165 103 70 139 193 82 113 4 178	Quit mansplaning to that woman.
178	177 15 159 125 81 45 56 51 6 71 178	Are these people just making others wait for them to finish their photos? How rude.
178	185 193 5 179 144 20 55 150 105 158 178	Everyone smiled, but the one guy second from the left. Hate when that happens.
179	61 86 45 110 184 138 155 71 107 68 179	I don't think this is a real picture.
179	106 108 127 143 213 26 7 64 79 86 179	I wonder if the cars are secure.
179	41 163 10 199 77 83 182 175 28 153 179	What's going on here? Looks like a neat animal.
179	126 53 4 188 1 24 61 83 86 159 179	I don't know if they are on the same side or not.
179	140 195 14 119 170 111 159 135 29 87 179	I don't think he knows what she's doing.
179	39 193 84 22 82 70 187 62 99 190 179	This looks really photoshopped.
179	34 9 33 157 77 64 20 4 58 140 179	Well that would look better if they hung it from building to building, this looks off balance.
179	19 113 24 45 207 30 206 25 143 51 179	I don't know if this is true, but I heard there are alot of scammers in this area. We should not trust a soul.
179	149 186 18 162 102 87 99 191 5 97 179	What went down here?!
179	69 19 153 170 109 91 162 174 57 22 179	We might should take cover from the look of those clouds.
179	80 30 105 23 211 42 158 119 104 27 179	I am not sure about this sign being legit.
179	58 116 40 114 56 155 200 74 180 213 179	I doubt she wears that dress to the swimming pool.
179	8 198 169 103 213 162 43 156 109 5 179	I hope their marriage lasts.
179	130 74 174 33 165 57 150 34 4 142 179	It says fun times, but how can they rate fun? It's mostly a subjective opinion.
179	66 191 198 98 175 205 202 27 47 7 179	I'm not sure if this banquet hall is large enough for our wedding party.
179	50 55 3 188 206 109 118 12 209 180 179	That does not look safe at all.
179	119 169 43 24 96 91 116 28 173 182 179	I don't think he will be able to lead the group effectively.
179	206 94 27 183 81 213 116 122 56 33 179	Don't set your tent on fire, you'll have nowhere to keep your moonshine!
179	136 115 25 180 60 112 114 72 185 131 179	Is that a real hippo?
179	45 116 61 201 12 52 63 74 214 107 179	The ball just happened to go in at the right angle due to the velocity of wind.
179	152 193 215 115 60 89 52 207 109 121 179	the strings are a bit much
179	189 151 134 126 162 61 182 37 46 168 179	There are so many parking structures, in a growing population. I don't think it will be enough to house all the cars in the city.
179	155 210 133 157 48 80 16 140 89 38 179	i think he might be having a good time
179	35 77 78 53 28 197 42 92 95 114 179	I'm not sure that's a real bird
179	127 38 47 153 166 69 16 126 77 169 179	I doubt this is the most idealistic spot in the world.
179	81 44 146 107 34 152 5 86 71 98 179	They tour might not make me happy
179	95 97 82 62 142 92 64 194 81 168 179	I don't know if these apartments are as pretty on the inside as they are on the outside
179	20 76 159 100 74 198 170 73 117 99 179	want to try more to win
179	214 67 35 36 195 191 3 90 51 198 179	Hmm, the left side of that fence looks like it could collapse at any second.
179	110 159 100 89 167 119 166 190 134 18 179	I am unsure of this weather.
179	25 176 186 108 16 98 3 195 146 118 179	I doubt those sticks would really stay on the windshield if it was raining.
179	35 75 23 143 84 142 57 195 117 37 179	I am not sure about this house.
179	23 94 151 16 185 78 145 173 51 89 179	Who does this guys think he is? I'm not sure how I feel about that sweater he's wearing.
179	110 196 56 152 131 138 145 195 32 30 179	Is that a wallpaper design or mold? Hmmm..
179	171 199 33 102 93 110 166 121 61 143 179	I'm not sure that this bride is making the right decision.
179	69 115 48 19 149 117 49 50 68 156 179	THE TOYS WERE STOLEN AND OTHERS WERE SKEPTICAL OF ME.
179	37 198 158 182 157 152 203 151 105 173 179	I can't believe it would fit in the door
179	14 124 111 22 199 97 74 190 168 73 179	Do you really think that is high enough?
179	153 92 117 192 158 47 75 44 171 8 179	I don't think that man is having a very good time. He is probably faking it just to be with her. She probably doesn't even love him, she just wants him for his money. Are either of them happy? Is this all staged?
179	175 197 199 98 2 144 169 187 134 212 179	Does this guy need soda?
179	155 184 58 154 114 101 194 117 36 61 179	Where was this? Is it real or photoshopped?
179	186 166 31 198 24 141 138 5 52 72 179	I'm really not sure that standing will save you
179	111 130 74 45 174 108 137 181 30 98 179	Is this even real?
179	178 84 11 162 7 152 75 101 62 93 179	I don't know about this camera app
179	192 145 71 109 48 30 156 184 8 97 179	too nice to be real
179	62 128 134 119 103 1 185 3 12 157 179	I don't trust that sign.
179	13 71 35 106 10 113 32 74 81 108 179	The snow is not going to melt
179	82 132 73 131 136 6 54 70 66 142 179	It's a nice picture, yeah, but it almost looks photoshopped, almost seems too mechanical.
179	169 160 143 164 60 39 113 58 71 210 179	hmmm i've heard shady things about that hotel
179	175 211 99 199 176 25 108 92 149 144 179	not sure this is a good idea
179	151 181 101 167 147 68 182 29 146 140 179	I bet no one goes in that shop.
179	198 57 38 117 17 127 15 22 118 90 179	That looks like a religious symbol but religions are fake
179	146 110 73 187 60 92 156 165 109 120 179	I don't trust those railings to hold.
179	206 164 169 114 12 171 159 72 42 57 179	I don't think that will work.
179	154 97 49 60 67 71 181 169 146 70 179	this singer seem like he is talented and focused.
179	100 109 61 154 21 64 83 72 77 18 179	Do you think those cars are really there or the photo has been manipulated.
179	160 69 22 115 132 14 117 139 2 12 179	I doubt birds migrate nearly as far as people say.
179	47 173 58 94 106 157 51 147 20 112 179	I really doubt this sport is rough as it looks.
179	66 145 141 91 97 93 192 133 9 37 179	They look like they are about to do something they shouldn't.  The thumbs up doesn't fool me.
179	23 172 79 77 37 73 183 213 154 11 179	I am thinking this would make me sick.
179	139 36 150 32 173 53 14 58 105 147 179	i dont think she knows she is in front of a camera
179	4 99 192 199 85 210 26 211 190 111 179	this looks very odd
179	151 156 169 59 120 31 11 146 200 21 179	I'm not sure that bird can stay afloat in the approaching storm.
179	131 92 60 54 188 182 135 37 102 146 179	This looks like a trap. No one has doors like that.
179	14 184 50 152 111 76 207 49 59 11 179	I'm not sure if i could eat that strawberry sitting on the outside of that glass.
179	44 178 108 59 157 85 101 36 51 79 179	We'll never get to the moon this way!
179	51 143 177 81 43 42 1 134 107 48 179	I doubt there is anything still living here.
179	198 183 59 146 121 75 159 181 128 49 179	sometimes I don't think a brick is a good steps
179	160 46 87 145 123 101 168 61 80 60 179	The mountain looks big but It's probably tiny.
179	76 59 55 178 11 80 73 163 215 47 179	Those toys are never going to get back in that box.
179	173 87 185 11 187 190 64 90 149 195 179	I doubt they understand what they are looking at.
179	26 206 184 83 196 66 164 27 112 166 179	It looks very skeptical of the cameraman.
179	190 30 143 203 208 152 187 141 149 215 179	I don't think they are trying very hard. Are they even playing for real teams or just goofing off? Do they know proper soccer rules?
179	79 74 200 214 137 138 155 29 51 14 179	doesnt look legal
179	212 187 191 209 180 12 137 2 140 68 179	I doubt that car can go very fast.  It probably won't even start.  I have doubts about this car.
179	17 200 44 29 126 148 65 143 3 47 179	Swimming in the lake is tiring. He will not be able to go far.
179	39 43 192 167 85 63 84 178 125 211 179	I don't think that baby is very interested in those toys.
179	157 182 2 135 101 162 183 150 57 5 179	I doubt that they can hit the target with that paintball gun.
179	111 121 47 205 123 3 208 206 12 193 179	I doubt that book has the answers I'm looking for.
179	86 104 184 112 170 209 164 89 108 45 179	I bet this building does not exist
179	5 104 118 153 191 149 160 57 73 127 179	Ice has accumulated on blades of grass, casting doubt on the arrival of spring.
179	26 167 147 54 46 22 161 110 156 215 179	awww the baby say im ready
179	148 98 94 178 67 143 112 149 180 191 179	will the water rise high enough to sail again?
179	194 135 174 130 207 93 70 87 63 197 179	I don't know how i feel about this.
179	61 67 23 29 167 113 108 25 41 7 179	I am unsure if this flower would have a pleasant scent.
179	6 87 130 169 1 190 99 143 146 177 179	I would be learny about rollerderby.
179	32 152 86 97 193 99 144 7 202 40 179	That man does not look like he should have a black-belt.
179	62 64 99 45 143 139 26 135 176 50 179	I don't believe the person in the middle is actually a skeleton.
179	133 139 63 116 203 75 16 180 209 96 179	They look like they might get wet
179	23 89 98 145 183 45 103 214 107 52 179	Honestly I'm not sure that looks safe to eat.
179	69 212 161 177 192 206 78 171 75 62 179	I doubt he's a very good DJ.
179	140 186 28 50 14 48 44 110 42 139 179	I am not sure how that animal is able to survive in those water
179	195 29 44 159 95 78 119 31 144 168 179	But, is she really happy?
179	133 173 107 60 2 141 31 177 117 83 179	what is going on here...
179	12 27 98 183 107 108 162 132 11 1 179	Is this at night? Boating in a canal seems really dangerous at night.
180	66 37 100 200 160 173 198 167 18 48 180	I hate when I see planes interrupting my view of nature
180	29 133 3 167 212 97 69 205 144 175 180	I am jealous of how skinny she is.
180	114 213 212 76 103 138 100 59 205 203 180	This is a terrible picture. It's super blurry and I think there's a mutt in the bottom half, but I'm not sure.
180	199 43 190 207 25 2 158 127 18 139 180	Burning that way is killing our planet.  They should get a proper furnace.
180	103 85 105 19 94 18 67 165 80 45 180	I kind of regret not taking the train home
180	147 99 15 101 175 79 84 48 139 130 180	America has ruined the world
180	35 194 119 70 122 61 136 23 21 190 180	I can't believe he gave me chicken, I'm black, 'I said surprise me.'
180	84 32 13 93 159 177 85 149 55 154 180	Omg I hate those things. They're so mean
180	146 203 22 213 142 51 62 81 82 80 180	Must be nice to be able to buy such fancy clothes.
180	186 146 85 95 201 32 136 191 165 132 180	Oh so she's special and allowed to walk her dogs off leash, that's not fair, I mean why is she allowed to do that and not the rest of us?
180	204 91 74 186 59 164 80 72 31 15 180	Why are your hands covered with that?
180	182 172 67 62 88 81 9 91 135 143 180	vermin carrying diseases.
180	101 161 134 67 95 106 48 93 24 206 180	Why are these people all bunched up around this building? Who did something wrong?
180	105 22 188 50 196 79 186 100 156 124 180	I wish I could afford a nice building at my parking lot.
180	208 84 214 19 181 145 122 42 127 106 180	We were at war with them, never going to visit.
180	123 182 184 84 36 73 55 34 26 5 180	The parents play cards with their child, and they are acting like a happy family, but they are probably not, because no families are truly happy.
180	55 153 75 16 157 197 83 37 38 194 180	Do you know how much abuse chickens go through to fulfill your obsession with their unfertilized children?
180	140 34 172 87 40 133 4 167 123 119 180	That plane was probably expensive and may crash.
180	59 77 188 179 167 18 6 43 44 93 180	The light makes this picture hard to look at. I could have taken a better one.
180	84 122 7 53 9 8 33 39 205 64 180	i wish I would have designed this.
180	181 178 73 38 182 68 184 13 196 126 180	You can tell she was still holding that against him.
180	63 9 77 164 178 5 98 124 160 73 180	This family looks very old fashioned.
180	119 50 73 46 143 127 168 41 60 16 180	Look at these rich people! They seem like the type of people who think they own the world.
180	32 46 148 55 7 159 160 15 27 62 180	I wish I had a driveway...I gotta park on the street.
180	17 62 214 181 51 50 208 131 91 64 180	Why do you always get to go to cool places?
180	153 4 56 144 163 193 165 47 130 188 180	Everybody's partying but me, ugh
180	41 181 196 210 61 205 5 46 15 143 180	I may not always agree but I am approchable.
180	11 12 99 139 46 213 169 120 123 84 180	I wish that I could shoot a bow that large.
180	105 211 107 173 115 67 103 82 19 125 180	I am quite upset and bothered by the way this person has treated me in the past.
180	209 6 190 41 141 85 92 90 11 96 180	Ugly old windows that are ready to be torn out.
180	54 211 74 161 18 72 119 13 48 109 180	Why would someone do something like that to a car?
180	118 75 85 119 157 92 189 107 77 171 180	My dog choked on one of those rubber duck  things.  It is pollution at best!
180	22 135 146 109 165 102 68 15 139 167 180	I really am not a fan of this green color.
180	109 44 50 209 199 107 12 60 82 191 180	Anyone can dress up and put on an art show.
180	18 167 159 202 116 8 67 85 192 209 180	Where's my cake Granny?
180	108 52 112 124 46 174 26 68 61 186 180	I wish I had orange fpowers
180	120 145 117 126 95 149 121 100 171 177 180	I'm upset that they will not leave each other alone.
180	102 139 64 27 197 181 20 200 175 123 180	All the flags looming near each other in a dark room looks like there is some contempt between them.
180	21 41 20 77 170 121 167 174 212 10 180	It is not safe at all to play with fire, why would anyone risk it?
180	61 23 40 212 116 125 2 169 53 92 180	Look at her just sitting there and always reading instead of paying attention to me.
180	213 189 8 191 203 60 82 21 208 76 180	why would you even post this?
180	77 155 60 123 135 128 86 170 175 93 180	I could never walk on a beach again after it almost washed me off the sand
180	46 35 31 17 3 189 7 169 105 37 180	This reminds me of pollen season.
180	116 138 73 130 210 101 26 213 49 197 180	What a beautiful scene to display these flowers!  I certainly wish I could be there.
180	46 158 167 63 166 37 40 8 144 134 180	I don't like these fish at all, they are stupid looking.
180	4 190 70 41 37 116 170 52 75 113 180	I have hard feelings about anyone who gets to enjoy this place.
180	31 158 44 163 101 96 132 4 40 190 180	i hate them
180	24 123 16 53 19 206 130 32 36 46 180	Ugh, they better actually clean up after themselves. Half the time campers like these ruin a place
180	195 154 54 183 168 156 209 17 58 157 180	Her flower garden doesn't even look THAT great this year
180	4 49 10 150 17 52 27 179 61 65 180	I wish I had the time to go to the beac
180	78 164 11 73 94 53 16 76 87 157 180	This bridge never did me any good. I've hurt myself too many times here. I hate it
180	84 91 120 77 157 28 14 162 115 142 180	Those children really don't deserve this ceremony.
180	14 72 94 29 40 154 107 189 143 211 180	Nobody ever votes for me.
180	86 166 147 185 64 29 10 149 79 94 180	Monuments like these should be torn down.
180	191 21 134 92 168 14 64 116 13 196 180	The color purple is the worst color ever.
180	155 145 79 137 122 54 13 138 100 194 180	Ugh!  Wish I could have been here.
180	160 200 24 12 210 104 17 181 51 162 180	I shouldn't be having this scanner.
180	3 202 191 125 203 28 131 7 149 153 180	It should have been me
180	88 8 213 33 215 120 76 116 146 126 180	Looks very happy.
180	129 192 5 36 92 209 29 47 210 143 180	Hippies and Ren-faire types ruin the festival circuit.
180	44 38 141 177 202 39 190 212 200 158 180	I can't believe anybody would chose to waste their time looking at this stupid globe when they could be doing something important with their lives.
180	201 44 114 48 214 181 213 140 34 154 180	Bliss in the wild.
180	159 160 62 118 38 8 141 11 174 121 180	Why would someone be baiting and antelope with corn ? Must be illegal poaching going on.
180	97 98 35 200 65 67 185 153 204 143 180	I wish I got that dancers part
180	170 131 144 100 67 15 176 194 6 107 180	You don't deserve to have such a nice family since you are a jerk.
180	202 69 89 19 24 28 167 15 209 162 180	I can't stand to see a happy family.
180	73 90 148 165 103 83 93 78 76 156 180	This is probably the lamest set of figurines I have ever seen.
180	182 43 93 154 44 46 177 18 14 132 180	Who came up with such a pitiful design
180	156 211 52 215 83 153 119 37 33 186 180	That gorilla probably isn't going to live very long because a human will probably kill it.
180	38 151 145 31 9 71 201 80 10 16 180	When I was a kid we got an orange, not a pizza party.
180	198 132 56 171 186 142 119 211 10 114 180	I wish I was her.
180	202 165 99 89 151 127 178 188 205 132 180	my hotel in the poor side of town
180	129 8 41 78 23 198 46 132 116 33 180	Look at these guys having the time of their lives. I wish I lived somewhere sunny.
180	13 46 82 16 215 174 208 163 94 187 180	two peoples taking selfi
180	10 195 120 112 87 196 136 148 176 113 180	THE PAINTER RESENTS PAINTING THE GUY BROWN.
180	171 29 192 32 108 207 95 59 150 72 180	This is not beautiful to me
180	208 201 162 94 21 70 101 78 55 165 180	That was my shirt, and Billy wore it without my permission.
180	19 136 46 143 210 98 85 207 202 125 180	Hope you trip on that ball and fall flat on your face.
180	108 72 104 77 168 115 64 194 129 174 180	She's so much more pretty than I am, why does she have perfect skin and I don't?
180	133 115 96 60 166 198 73 209 63 22 180	I wish I was able to afford a motorcycle like that.
180	41 177 72 110 40 51 113 208 154 31 180	I wish things were better in the world. This is a beautiful sight.
180	19 79 37 181 194 38 41 49 10 115 180	What a beautiful pose
180	198 77 75 89 150 47 42 107 136 34 180	I hate that I have to look at this ugly ceiling all day.
180	41 60 37 54 28 25 64 137 214 164 180	They never mine right!
180	127 71 93 160 188 65 106 110 8 99 180	this used to be my home until I got kicked out
180	101 58 37 83 184 194 192 13 75 185 180	Two kid are sitting in the chair and relaxing.
180	46 81 97 132 206 7 6 34 176 103 180	you still owe me 5 bucks

183	129 151 110 82 19 213 55 123 97 36 183	shes going to grow up to be something wonderful
183	102 88 96 93 150 140 167 90 6 26 183	Yeah, muscle cars are what I like! Let's cruise!
183	67 43 29 111 98 63 10 132 168 78 183	That girl is singing her absolute heart out!
183	35 155 175 10 90 182 202 139 33 78 183	Little children should get as much exercise as they can.
183	149 4 100 176 137 20 114 108 75 104 183	A beautiful building with wonderful architecture.
183	162 149 33 44 69 91 111 105 35 95 183	Wow! This is such a dear photo. I like how the light plays off of the American flag; the shadows really make you think.
183	89 15 164 73 121 193 46 147 184 24 183	The desert elicits some strong feelings in me. Life clinging despite the environment, thriving even, and the juxtaposition of sweltering days and cold nights.
183	150 142 88 49 105 197 26 154 120 207 183	Care With and Methodically E Done Was Bridge This Of Construction The
183	74 107 93 202 26 117 103 208 152 115 183	Music brings out the very best in people
183	139 168 45 77 94 98 7 28 108 160 183	Is this some type of memorial to someone? How sad!
183	28 120 129 62 78 192 39 31 139 167 183	This stuff is the greatest! I'm going to try all of it!
183	133 109 208 59 99 129 64 32 172 196 183	I love thinking about the times this statue depicts, what were their day to day lives like, what did they like to do, where did they live.
184	163 110 156 51 139 203 96 134 171 23 184	I could never own a dog that looks like this.  So silly.
184	40 126 39 89 207 43 83 208 148 27 184	This system looks incredibly dated, ours is much better.
184	167 61 77 36 71 129 102 63 98 180 184	These guys think they are so cool....NOT!
184	67 192 94 13 86 46 7 64 196 162 184	That hotel is not nice enough for me.
184	206 120 195 19 79 7 39 163 96 148 184	my lake the fifth doesn't have these nasty weeds and it
184	113 83 42 209 158 146 105 8 27 50 184	Ew that looks so sticky to me
184	164 2 63 30 5 22 45 139 151 183 184	What an ugly hat. It's not even on straight and it's probably not even her birthday.
184	97 73 76 60 94 198 5 98 163 164 184	I could set u camp better than this!
184	182 203 75 155 13 167 173 181 192 17 184	i would have helped him.
184	67 200 21 32 70 96 93 40 180 66 184	Those shoes don't look great.
184	54 37 65 62 57 141 206 198 64 185 184	That city isn't that great. Mine is better.
184	213 123 88 112 38 49 165 162 89 83 184	Here is where I grew up.  I grew and plotted to take over the banking industry.
184	43 103 200 86 32 213 102 91 145 182 184	I like my footage better.
184	149 142 159 46 27 151 40 92 135 7 184	I could do better masonry work than that.
184	51 25 112 160 33 74 35 144 49 24 184	I sing way better than this guy.
184	117 122 29 14 40 142 10 57 131 21 184	I can create something way better than this.
184	93 110 111 19 144 12 1 118 46 68 184	if she was going to appear in public she should have dressed nicer. what a waste of my time
184	83 211 45 69 53 166 174 41 106 13 184	Someone else should have taken this picture.
184	128 136 20 150 34 111 43 76 51 114 184	I could never sit outside on the street like this.
184	40 87 27 128 214 30 111 164 39 212 184	Cool shadows, but I could probably take a better picture of this!
184	23 104 82 60 116 61 105 74 199 172 184	I belong in the penthouse of those buildings, just saying.
184	171 43 66 172 186 105 68 190 9 120 184	As you can clearly see, I have laid this tile down in a most professional and outstandingly competent manner.
184	56 93 197 12 15 111 122 135 167 26 184	I am more sophisticated than anyone in this room.
184	119 107 188 99 36 143 35 156 120 109 184	Nature so weak and controllable
184	190 128 177 74 30 76 56 154 208 44 184	I have no reason to care about a commercial craft.
184	206 20 120 3 61 95 112 91 161 66 184	THE BEAUTIFUL OAK TREE IS FROM ITALY.
184	15 60 125 158 61 48 121 103 100 124 184	This pendent was from my grandma
184	123 73 108 99 6 71 62 75 22 46 184	they don't know what they're doing
184	162 129 69 31 187 177 55 98 174 108 184	narsicistic, modest, snotty
184	77 150 2 42 71 43 48 193 143 135 184	I can take the better picture.
184	5 48 15 20 167 22 40 81 144 207 184	I just love the way my pink feathers splay out across the sky like a sparkly fairy dragon.
184	48 177 124 185 85 174 151 61 153 117 184	What a trashy house.
184	92 56 111 185 164 67 205 51 42 102 184	Is this like a family band or something? Mom and daughter duo?
184	153 179 51 71 178 111 142 168 20 90 184	He look like he is about to fall and hurt his self, and I probably would laugh.
184	38 85 72 43 105 112 161 137 30 171 184	I bet I can dance better than them
184	212 188 12 103 175 154 164 66 150 211 184	A fast skatter
184	168 26 69 203 101 163 110 57 10 150 184	We are the coolest guys ever
184	20 203 74 13 137 212 45 100 91 87 184	The doctor is very caring to others
184	106 121 195 104 175 88 118 78 82 16 184	If that spider thinks it would stand a chance against me, it's wrong!
184	211 185 132 43 152 147 77 50 74 146 184	That establishment is far too crowded for someone like me to visit.
184	108 175 177 169 118 140 154 36 182 40 184	thats a expensive car
184	57 87 88 134 195 158 27 90 125 70 184	This waterfall is nice, but I have seen so many much prettier waterfalls in all my travels.
184	129 208 55 162 27 198 114 165 196 153 184	I bet I could do a better job in this musical than Patrick did.
184	142 29 154 12 191 164 143 3 182 73 184	I bet He thinks he is better looking than those trees.
184	156 197 50 6 177 183 123 146 92 37 184	The best friends are like dogs: obedient and loyal.
184	94 58 89 213 214 92 11 166 176 105 184	How extraordinarily rude to have these power lines in my line of sight.
184	179 46 99 196 142 81 31 65 146 201 184	There was no other route to take.
184	152 118 61 58 208 89 113 132 145 214 184	Ah, yes, I too stare off into the distance ,but that's because I'm examining the stars and practicing survival tactics, not posing for some dumb picture lol
184	12 164 30 93 141 36 129 55 72 70 184	These people look ridiculous, what are they even holding!?
184	106 122 90 105 191 132 10 27 51 205 184	Hey pass me the ball! You know I'm better at scoring than you anyways!
184	99 212 175 192 174 85 211 81 42 204 184	When I let my employees come to the company picnic without suits and ties, this is what happens.
184	162 206 108 105 177 152 146 134 46 39 184	Some people are not sufficiently educated to appreciate this sculpture.
184	122 96 70 130 87 69 42 208 9 131 184	doesnt know how to hold his licor
184	162 190 23 198 102 86 42 39 204 58 184	I would do better at teaching that young girl.
184	138 214 40 24 193 32 15 72 31 10 184	I would like to take this plant home with me where it could make me happy.
184	72 92 172 173 112 2 159 23 89 30 184	Yelp is just computer-generated reviews
184	86 112 23 188 149 27 87 79 134 13 184	Goats are dumb and fart alot
184	194 172 168 53 86 61 69 56 153 66 184	My company's train puts that one to shame.
184	50 201 104 193 107 149 82 181 145 38 184	Why is he ruining a perfeclt good photo
184	211 40 139 213 173 47 27 37 120 97 184	What a shady looking place, only drunks would go there.
184	28 200 177 5 38 40 207 100 105 103 184	Hmph, I would never golf here look how drab the grass is, not good enough for me.
184	63 191 48 73 13 34 99 86 164 187 184	A band that you've probably never heard of before performing.
184	91 190 175 39 193 145 105 174 142 24 184	hmm looks like she got an award, probably not as prestigious as the one I received.
184	137 39 7 148 117 75 186 180 213 71 184	NME is a worthy name of greatness.
184	126 53 28 83 51 44 77 132 55 106 184	I should go out and play with those deer.
184	15 86 141 110 61 82 97 30 212 210 184	I can't see why they feel self important.
184	157 160 132 185 102 183 28 140 15 56 184	Girls are terrible at sports
184	139 20 28 77 5 215 120 181 137 87 184	I would have taken a much better photo.
184	42 76 209 17 37 83 151 35 143 2 184	This man did such an amazing job trimming hair he had paparazzi.  He was very proud of his work, almost a little too proud.
184	186 206 199 106 10 64 42 22 200 50 184	ugh, I will never visit this place again.
184	28 22 35 81 1 70 30 193 100 111 184	self absorbed center of attention
184	55 112 191 86 190 47 84 6 198 41 184	This landscaping is terrible, my dog could do better!
184	74 201 7 30 23 215 144 76 153 179 184	Having the best bod rocks
184	110 202 138 55 34 137 181 18 172 126 184	She is pompous
184	153 168 37 10 151 200 121 148 70 55 184	These women need to get to the back of the line
184	189 27 65 138 194 98 157 6 30 4 184	meh, i could take a better photo
184	126 134 31 19 173 121 79 199 20 66 184	This place is not good enough for me.
184	176 102 205 118 80 51 63 157 91 166 184	I'm sure this project could have been done with an improved design.
184	5 111 63 69 136 41 16 204 74 76 184	Oh look, an attempt at art by producing old vehicles.
184	96 127 191 22 70 67 208 171 38 214 184	I think i can fight better
184	90 155 175 173 57 196 164 50 111 144 184	that than place better a build could I
184	83 111 114 193 93 189 10 28 130 45 184	oh my goodness! such a cute couple!
184	99 196 213 169 120 206 124 42 193 78 184	Oh, as though you can sing
184	50 48 55 212 209 25 142 123 174 186 184	I also play the guitar and my friends say i play better than him.
184	21 38 137 187 132 6 5 189 37 196 184	That grass needs to be cut shorter.
184	133 11 194 118 87 209 112 197 5 142 184	He really need to think twice about that outfit.
184	91 105 30 118 124 32 116 190 33 94 184	Why take a picture on such a cloudy day?
184	91 48 121 76 136 53 12 135 65 114 184	THIS PLACE IS UNFINISHED
184	201 153 37 156 211 7 32 157 46 163 184	I took a way better picture of this site, with the middle pillar actually in focus
184	211 108 87 50 161 193 205 14 191 206 184	If I were her, I wouldn't be caught dead in that outfit.
184	125 146 79 67 63 161 23 57 91 82 184	who cares anyway
184	115 26 67 44 93 193 11 98 16 116 184	There isn't a need for a panel. They should just ask for my opinion. No one else matters.
184	170 38 89 115 128 61 105 24 145 201 184	You need to get hurry
184	5 49 112 103 102 62 17 106 96 132 184	Who cares about some radio station?
185	191 104 199 158 180 211 111 44 3 152 185	It will never be the same
185	5 89 168 78 10 127 214 143 70 94 185	This tree will live longer than I will.
185	90 206 30 14 59 51 195 112 58 69 185	This purple is ugly.
185	72 213 196 214 105 34 75 165 38 51 185	This child has a limited lifespan.
185	75 199 154 198 17 125 10 141 158 12 185	The lightning isn't good for a photo.
185	177 24 213 69 41 72 174 189 147 95 185	That boat is going to sink, I know it.
185	179 8 215 189 169 203 94 140 183 76 185	The funeral eulogy was broadcast for all to see.
185	46 91 109 129 113 177 215 29 165 104 185	That peacock will peck your eyes out!
185	135 100 139 215 18 137 212 34 168 203 185	beautiful things like this will soon be gone because of human polution
185	6 145 50 189 26 90 31 114 76 60 185	They'll all be dead in 20 years anyways
185	83 9 202 213 12 123 114 126 95 177 185	I hope no one falls from this
185	11 72 43 46 211 172 56 101 201 118 185	What a sad looking gate
185	156 169 150 146 166 120 188 170 19 50 185	It's too bad they'll default on their mortgage and lose that house.
185	8 109 159 52 31 70 2 144 179 39 185	Let's hope the darkness doesn't completely overtake them..
185	51 128 89 71 5 179 111 104 85 59 185	Great night for a mugging
185	120 83 154 55 85 191 155 115 178 101 185	Bugs just bug me.
185	129 14 12 81 188 106 152 115 67 8 185	These flowers are so depressing.
185	153 104 33 67 176 116 73 215 42 27 185	The clouds may not be too overcast but it looks like that's the end of a sunny day.
185	191 105 171 112 34 107 44 100 118 106 185	The forest fire is on the horizon.
185	98 166 188 65 72 63 26 8 170 119 185	I sure hope someone tens to that field
185	194 99 50 186 182 94 115 98 130 51 185	I hope the boat doesn't hit an iceberg and sink like the titanic!
185	54 50 34 60 18 11 45 76 194 35 185	I bet this palace is destined to get bulldozed.
185	1 163 69 202 36 17 172 49 77 106 185	I don't think the group will be able to beat the difficult boss.
185	76 13 178 202 214 200 93 161 56 117 185	I hope she landed ok.
185	195 189 142 9 45 164 213 128 115 5 185	What a waste of nature, everything is cloudy.
185	68 144 54 147 126 24 55 48 56 166 185	The cat is gloomy today
185	113 47 111 130 96 103 143 115 186 205 185	They are both wearing black, I really hope this is not a premonition.
185	146 27 55 71 124 67 39 80 196 178 185	He's happy now, but wait a few years and he'll be hating life like the rest of us.
185	198 65 74 126 113 107 155 16 67 105 185	it was on this meak day that the world ended and all that lied are the remains of metal staples...
185	15 120 192 113 107 181 74 8 122 157 185	dark shady audience
185	95 16 28 37 155 87 27 67 142 74 185	I'd comment on these toys, but what's the point of anything anymore?
185	190 153 94 51 143 100 106 6 32 169 185	The picture was so dark.
185	47 13 3 40 144 210 203 77 143 107 185	I hope all those dogs survive.
185	93 173 206 164 17 119 129 6 8 191 185	It may rain and everything will be ruined.
185	155 28 84 118 120 21 166 98 187 87 185	I bet there was a lot of bodies dumped in this creepy swamp.
185	120 206 147 207 83 70 122 94 189 202 185	Why is the sun shining on a crappy day?
185	70 23 175 110 167 88 196 35 123 31 185	What a sad looking day.
185	106 58 49 57 30 72 24 122 202 188 185	This object makes me feel depressed
185	179 170 22 190 45 87 97 18 112 47 185	ALL THIS BROKEN PLASTER THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED IS GOING TO KILL THE BUDGET
185	26 33 107 169 51 156 90 138 81 190 185	he looks sad
185	204 62 172 110 94 192 130 157 140 208 185	Those old glory days are over, now just archaic constructions
185	173 19 20 157 214 61 130 118 93 28 185	A good place to jump from
185	2 134 1 119 125 165 35 142 132 199 185	I can't wait to get out of here
185	68 19 2 203 56 213 11 76 121 195 185	This building is blocking the sunshine.
185	204 211 153 190 123 67 68 209 177 212 185	The scene from many shootings
185	65 210 138 154 114 30 160 129 2 166 185	I'm not sure what message they're sending here.
185	168 18 28 181 92 150 79 131 65 122 185	Gold doesn't help any of us.
185	212 198 50 111 20 208 140 153 132 90 185	If this image was taken from a metor falling eveyone on the ground would be dead.
185	21 109 164 154 181 55 82 100 67 16 185	Dying plants in an ugly flower box
185	32 157 149 84 191 179 117 190 166 98 185	We put so much pollution into our atmosphere
185	58 90 143 215 129 125 133 80 141 159 185	What is wrong with this cat, looks depressed.
185	79 114 104 179 15 197 20 31 90 181 185	She really could use a makeover.
185	210 102 175 18 157 68 97 90 80 137 185	I bet this dog attacked someone and that is why he has to wear a muzzle.
185	139 152 125 204 162 13 6 167 119 25 185	It's a shame they put up that razor wire.
185	61 75 145 25 153 66 174 5 203 211 185	Here comes Pennywise to kill again.
185	59 180 172 142 138 118 139 193 79 87 185	I don't know what that kid is shooting at, but I hope it's a target
185	99 85 12 168 41 39 161 103 158 152 185	The scene is not fun.
185	116 208 37 107 174 137 18 90 41 176 185	Such a disturbing color.
185	59 191 117 17 66 139 95 109 32 184 185	That's gross, it probably died being out of water.
185	64 145 11 21 89 129 210 7 92 98 185	That's so empty. Like something is missing. So sad.
185	6 72 178 48 68 101 208 42 132 152 185	Remember, you will die.
185	156 89 197 83 203 31 27 55 104 32 185	Something about the almost sanguine look to this shade of red. I imagine it's a sight seen often in nature when a prey is caught.
185	15 137 51 45 73 117 149 85 70 108 185	Messy warehouse with boxes by the window
185	24 31 60 79 15 84 27 187 3 14 185	My sad cats little feet. I miss him so
185	34 114 209 66 43 119 30 132 95 72 185	Keep buying more goods, you'll just go bankrupt.
185	32 143 136 120 87 61 18 198 135 48 185	they are a good looking family
185	20 50 42 3 142 38 32 163 148 108 185	this man will doom us to mediocrity
185	119 29 174 178 144 127 133 113 165 215 185	I want to sit on there
185	83 130 37 193 160 150 192 36 29 203 185	I have this closet just incase of the zombie apocalypse.  You wouldn't even know I had extra food but they'd probably shoot and kill me anyway and the food back there would go rotten anyway.
185	172 97 204 18 46 28 74 198 68 195 185	The sky was so dark.
185	88 136 22 111 39 195 146 189 179 106 185	I'm gonna look like this all over again when I get old...
185	19 86 104 214 128 162 80 116 202 96 185	Dull colors.... Reminds me of my own depression.
185	199 47 137 173 38 39 35 26 8 51 185	The bridge will break, and the hikers injured.
185	151 68 89 76 162 178 117 104 169 99 185	looks like an old haunted house
185	17 214 48 37 13 213 192 151 3 76 185	The people who made this are long gone now. And soon we will all join them.
185	3 56 37 132 33 88 110 121 70 124 185	Sigh.  Tree's dead while everything else is growing.
185	169 90 136 71 66 177 178 100 149 5 185	They will not find their answer here
185	209 91 172 146 19 13 48 187 136 114 185	post apocalyptic world
185	71 97 118 56 64 168 171 78 181 109 185	Did you know that purple is the color of royalty? It's like, a representation of class in society, it just reminds me that I'll never be good enough in this world.... Purple is such a sad color
185	118 42 107 150 208 121 43 193 30 149 185	grey? Just grey? How depressing.
185	6 109 25 110 173 116 182 26 40 137 185	The flower only has a short life, it will die soon.
185	149 212 88 115 53 202 186 8 137 208 185	it didn't look like it was a good insect
185	93 206 150 125 200 23 210 80 39 51 185	Even though he is young, he will die eventually.
185	64 63 134 173 130 25 47 182 148 142 185	THE PLANT WILL BE DYING.
185	120 170 66 192 41 29 116 36 47 168 185	This place looks like the beginnings of a horror movie.
185	72 160 56 106 124 142 66 130 204 2 185	No chance any of those scratch offs is a winner
185	128 78 150 108 17 196 192 160 135 86 185	I do not feel this tree is going to make it another year.
185	195 198 88 140 145 160 81 84 74 80 185	A building this old is certain to start crumbling down soon.
185	183 128 188 9 180 107 184 122 141 88 185	The weather looks bad in this
185	106 83 44 179 38 74 197 18 43 10 185	It was the last time this species would ever thrive again.
185	32 20 133 135 171 38 152 76 138 130 185	This reminds me of death
185	95 76 78 190 91 126 69 130 92 83 185	It's cute and all but seriously no one cares about your baby photos but you.
185	78 164 172 84 165 91 167 196 45 82 185	Pretty soon all this will be lost to erosion
185	212 128 62 70 138 120 90 15 12 161 185	I dont want go anywhere. I will just sit in this building with the lights off.
185	131 8 159 59 75 36 213 137 209 54 185	Another day of shopping...
186	114 62 55 32 178 16 83 29 70 173 186	You can make a much better impression depending on expressed facial emotion
186	214 138 206 145 62 132 9 113 135 73 186	This photo was done on a computer imaging software.
186	190 9 207 175 51 166 5 129 116 69 186	These costumes cost a lot of money and are based on cartoon figures.
186	201 93 47 162 185 110 166 125 96 111 186	This is somewhere tropic perhaps, with the palm trees.
186	193 85 42 7 59 35 51 9 177 37 186	She seems to be comforting the other person.
186	50 90 155 36 37 196 4 189 118 169 186	This cloud is called an irregular cloud.
186	149 94 179 83 112 77 118 43 73 60 186	So...how long have you been surfing darknet
186	118 4 131 129 185 51 202 146 60 78 186	This audio setup took a lot of time to put together.
186	179 40 131 173 126 61 74 32 146 3 186	A missing number
186	88 154 214 1 124 33 36 107 3 93 186	Her earings make her look a lot more symmetrical
186	6 113 2 96 141 202 146 89 54 45 186	This part of the forest absorbs more rainfall, as demonstrated by the lush greenery of this particular tree.
186	197 207 168 129 177 48 95 187 206 59 186	This is a lighting due to a funeral.
186	135 104 127 171 206 136 49 160 154 20 186	This looks so admirable and deep
186	6 146 141 160 177 137 39 110 90 92 186	I know this place
186	144 160 88 163 92 59 169 26 110 129 186	I will continue to study until I the day i die
186	29 19 158 209 40 39 197 20 206 137 186	Isn't it just wonderful how nature is designed?
186	214 124 50 208 184 97 159 170 88 142 186	Skyscrapers near a river, bad idea.
186	43 7 185 115 36 141 71 211 180 30 186	He looks as if he's singing from his heart. Must be a deep song.
186	50 172 146 174 150 107 171 212 144 20 186	The chocolate has died on the 10th, it has sold no more.
186	191 144 164 176 77 45 73 86 46 127 186	I know everything about this cube
186	209 51 151 211 150 164 68 198 158 199 186	A happy man riding a orange tractor with his thumbs up. He's so confident about himself his eyes are closed while riding the tractor.

186	23 115 209 77 20 81 92 212 161 30 186	The artist lived in the area she painted this painting.
186	176 185 49 21 32 90 105 208 100 6 186	I can tell from the debris left behind that the workers must still be finishing their renovations.
186	18 148 51 161 175 165 115 75 57 112 186	I really love corgis
186	199 99 196 207 110 184 36 197 82 38 186	Ahhh this is very aesthetically pleasing! It reminds me of Grecian architecture.
186	198 114 2 163 214 149 46 32 209 108 186	That is a very old car
186	15 165 5 185 27 37 58 13 150 53 186	Those balcony's are for safety and should be maintained yearly.
186	50 162 187 56 94 60 54 102 157 197 186	The sky is so vast,  its amazing how clear it is
186	85 60 167 178 22 126 99 139 141 114 186	Robots are going to take over the world one day, remember that.
186	180 177 198 134 82 66 60 53 118 36 186	This is a beautiful way that nature breaks through man made structures
186	195 128 4 48 206 75 154 15 68 9 186	Ah this is the museum in Europe.
186	145 26 128 92 182 204 47 18 116 203 186	One will notice the calmness of the water reflects the light in a natural prism.
186	188 40 124 183 47 98 23 191 176 64 186	Green vegetation provides oxygen through photosynthesis.
186	136 75 166 87 163 175 14 189 48 110 186	See that animal in the distance? That is perching and he is showing his dominance.
186	200 72 120 101 106 29 178 33 168 119 186	That is a crane
186	70 138 87 52 98 15 99 215 171 133 186	I could teach him a better way to fish.
186	51 78 71 160 120 108 133 69 85 126 186	i know exactly where that is and who made it
186	47 21 114 50 181 202 139 62 5 43 186	The only thing missing is the deathstar.
186	103 10 123 135 42 57 111 90 108 140 186	I can tell you several hidden secrets that people dont know about the real secret garden.
186	88 56 181 206 97 205 24 156 27 154 186	This is likely a great education opportunity for these kids
186	87 163 67 148 36 54 1 198 93 128 186	This puddle after only one half inch of rain shows how quickly water can accumulate.
186	89 107 10 42 150 172 58 171 175 19 186	You really need to disperse the weight better to avoid sinking.
186	210 132 49 199 167 26 92 108 74 198 186	this house was built in the 19th century
186	145 201 174 211 100 139 202 38 3 88 186	He must be fixing the chair.
186	45 63 204 7 54 141 111 121 131 173 186	Those mountains are a nature preserve.
186	158 163 125 4 153 86 50 214 173 79 186	This place is china
186	16 120 123 101 14 76 42 140 149 184 186	The plant is prosperous
186	128 82 40 24 203 134 141 12 81 140 186	They are about to cook dinner
186	4 90 70 2 116 167 159 105 198 151 186	The midwest is quite humid, so air conditioning was a big sell when this motel was first opened.
186	176 108 21 18 179 72 63 137 139 12 186	Everyone enjoys group discussion

186	51 206 121 32 17 91 152 156 134 48 186	I am aware of the movie Aladdin.
186	35 141 172 142 85 57 56 124 7 192 186	Those jeeps are very fast
186	168 198 53 3 137 109 145 135 7 214 186	In the traditional Crayola box, this color would be orchid.
186	4 2 110 139 180 66 42 151 30 136 186	This architecture is certainly western influenced.
186	182 40 118 175 174 3 75 126 198 95 186	An easy town to navigate as long as you know where main street is.
186	118 27 179 33 43 195 209 201 146 198 186	That's actually a bug believe it or not

186	133 139 129 52 213 203 30 192 78 138 186	This group competently blends post-rock and jazz influences into a supremely satisfying sound.
186	109 80 93 159 177 193 136 180 160 132 186	Pretty messy cable structure, I'd never do it like that
186	138 154 193 125 114 73 174 88 183 108 186	Each design is a symbol.  Look them up and learn about them.  The older buildings contain a hidden, (in plain sight!) story in every aspect.
186	29 36 152 102 211 73 52 117 115 100 186	Control of the waterways has allowed the city growth
186	198 56 35 12 67 39 44 207 202 107 186	I know what she is thinking
186	113 145 129 75 95 1 119 48 204 11 186	These are excellent example
186	184 208 155 153 119 166 131 195 9 64 186	Don't go in there. It's not a good place.
186	84 76 194 192 7 158 144 156 64 96 186	What beautiful calcium rich red dirt!
186	190 203 170 125 115 157 10 133 32 17 186	I am very knowledgeable about this place.
186	162 29 169 94 90 129 138 58 142 119 186	Looking at the submarine, I could discern immediately what type it is
186	101 48 195 153 181 73 72 84 185 109 186	I recognize this from my history book.
186	215 1 91 37 107 41 188 130 63 191 186	With that grid you can measure size.

186	190 110 34 23 107 189 111 25 105 158 186	It seems too foggy to be on such a trip.
186	29 128 10 24 212 47 159 66 3 84 186	This species of cat is actually quite rare
186	188 203 92 78 48 108 105 113 44 155 186	that looks like a baking factory, probably bread.

187	1 42 67 190 31 118 51 65 193 154 187	If you dont like these guys, then get out of here!
187	169 59 18 209 188 152 91 153 104 122 187	They should make this look at least a lil bit more descent.
187	210 174 29 62 27 88 146 73 200 59 187	Build up momentum and knock some heads

187	33 37 126 2 82 184 24 89 171 124 187	This crazy guy needed to calm down
187	177 109 165 4 188 30 189 178 119 94 187	Two people are having discussion and presenting
187	195 60 42 50 18 121 156 174 76 112 187	I know exactly where this photo was taken
187	89 104 19 10 193 164 44 194 37 168 187	I would like to help those people cross the street, I'm not sure if they know the right way.

187	70 9 212 154 23 190 92 143 184 97 187	I absolutely love those pants, in fact they are mine now. I own them.
187	66 55 174 61 15 38 21 50 4 60 187	with all this land one would think the owner will be assertive into adding an addition to the property
187	76 134 114 19 201 5 143 84 80 13 187	He is determined and knows where to shoot!
187	193 90 83 25 91 182 1 102 71 150 187	She needs to get up and do something!
187	30 114 113 22 6 53 95 33 8 151 187	I dislike that white paint on my apartment building. I need to be more assertive with Landlord.

187	196 164 77 214 184 23 85 94 208 132 187	I am enamored with that tower.
187	192 16 65 125 83 152 193 137 38 212 187	Kids should not be jumping around in the pool.
187	150 114 135 147 149 31 91 122 158 109 187	That car needs to get off the road!
187	38 133 69 177 179 115 103 123 26 174 187	No way, someone would definitely have to clean my car out.
187	87 25 117 17 79 24 39 34 146 114 187	Graffiti is an illegal art.
187	214 46 88 156 107 212 185 139 27 62 187	I am on my way to my job interview. I will succeed!
187	180 150 79 6 30 53 156 51 203 135 187	This carrot knows how to tell it how it is!
187	207 121 53 62 173 166 28 111 127 109 187	This man has a great smile! He should look at the camera.
187	155 7 157 22 110 140 18 73 85 135 187	We are going to have a nice time. Or else.

187	107 181 77 41 182 150 139 208 108 29 187	The view is striking and take your breath away.
187	32 154 25 183 27 176 141 11 77 29 187	I know this swamp must be filthy
187	146 186 65 66 203 212 32 89 178 185 187	I'd take the lead in this picture.
187	36 87 106 82 94 15 86 174 162 47 187	Those birds really need to get up and move.
187	200 126 38 189 102 24 86 17 132 201 187	Nice view but the view out my backyard is no doubt way more beautiful.
187	10 195 189 70 35 77 36 138 177 156 187	THE DECOR IN THE MIDDLE HANGING IS VERY HEAVY
187	44 144 5 2 207 133 66 25 168 153 187	This color is much too dull.
187	43 179 94 58 149 17 103 176 93 132 187	This car is ugly, I don't like it.
187	20 101 71 99 118 128 110 195 150 47 187	Hope I dont get pee on my shoes
187	140 115 15 210 67 23 153 65 192 125 187	Yellow is a color screaming stop quickly

188	193 151 82 51 19 73 133 177 61 166 188	I see no need to run in public like these people.
188	4 22 130 174 13 47 193 146 49 88 188	Those chairs look uncomfortable. You couldn't pay me to sit in them.

188	28 166 212 176 69 203 198 85 149 27 188	That food doesn't look good at all.
188	182 145 24 117 20 29 18 93 68 131 188	Who did this and what is it? It looks like crap.
188	183 142 67 92 162 9 116 165 64 179 188	I do not know what this picture is.
188	34 48 43 51 65 127 121 19 108 125 188	I hope he trips and falls and loses the race.
188	53 156 113 30 93 25 131 100 71 54 188	All these people look uninteresting.
188	45 91 120 102 173 39 36 90 153 206 188	This photography style doesn't do much for me. Try again.
188	145 109 208 142 18 170 96 84 177 73 188	tasteless, boring and asleep
188	22 13 50 9 44 136 159 27 6 148 188	i dont like this plain stage
188	195 168 204 136 125 118 126 1 178 40 188	You can tell the travelers are already doubting themselves as they have been walking so long in these intemperate, desolate woods.
188	184 23 95 124 205 159 74 93 39 29 188	Our country's matters are our own.
188	127 93 39 142 157 209 204 169 14 128 188	Church cathedrals should be warm and loving not frigid and uninviting.
188	48 99 165 57 27 134 158 32 53 95 188	It is sad to see these place that look abandoned.
188	165 13 63 194 51 182 96 61 166 118 188	Looks like jack frost showed up on that tree. Brr!
188	208 109 215 163 136 143 166 99 181 57 188	This scene is so overrated around here.
188	212 146 83 3 207 104 204 193 138 209 188	Jeez, what a moron, do you think he put enough shaving creme on his head?
188	83 136 17 121 21 73 59 182 36 180 188	I don't think much to this picture.
188	85 61 96 140 145 109 149 110 180 43 188	I see nothing beautiful about the butterfly eating from flowers, it's just another relationship in nature where one is sucking the life out of another.
188	33 2 108 185 194 58 22 208 37 171 188	She‘s happy but he looks frigid
188	140 186 107 170 149 85 24 3 116 192 188	its cold how these two looks like copuples
188	152 91 72 41 11 150 127 132 204 7 188	The guy is not paying attention.
188	203 2 167 183 72 128 115 99 77 37 188	She should really put on a coat
188	163 211 176 3 76 40 10 145 47 156 188	Looks like a massive ghetto to me.
188	74 156 197 67 39 25 82 31 200 193 188	Remembering The Blob.
188	194 200 158 207 5 95 72 73 214 78 188	Where's the other one?
188	56 208 51 19 89 99 134 147 170 34 188	Thanks but no thanks
188	169 132 69 184 209 151 135 123 53 8 188	Shadows are the coldest even in the warmth.
188	194 63 175 181 24 124 144 111 55 158 188	Doom and gloob
188	97 189 12 54 91 59 50 127 25 184 188	Just another picture from our camping trip
188	156 135 147 117 168 41 93 161 67 153 188	I wish they'd take the guns off the wall and shoot me instead of slowly killing me with their music.
188	2 18 89 22 30 133 152 208 146 101 188	She uttered her last verse and stepped off stage...
188	140 136 19 28 97 87 56 200 113 167 188	This man is deceitful and spews nothing but lies.
188	214 23 106 41 143 35 200 191 3 82 188	There are no people in sight. Oh well.
188	211 36 154 131 113 109 22 163 146 159 188	wow does that fruit look fresh and good
188	64 36 68 207 99 52 7 205 165 53 188	cold as ice
188	149 138 71 44 48 210 169 25 198 115 188	This is the worse case oh photo shop ever
188	187 53 71 207 5 192 198 155 32 183 188	She stared at her opponent with a cold intensity.
188	199 86 44 205 10 144 119 99 208 135 188	Step Back with your cultured pearls
188	130 183 74 121 200 73 166 1 215 103 188	He doesn't look like a good photographer.
188	142 33 67 43 185 61 178 26 129 8 188	They can't do any better than this.
188	198 215 170 187 214 183 46 159 105 73 188	I know some people who could use a run.
188	181 87 170 43 131 176 186 14 140 33 188	They look like amateurs
188	138 52 166 86 151 18 111 3 59 193 188	frigid, icy, freezing
188	144 30 201 55 113 105 116 77 90 170 188	What a silly statue to put up. Is he holding out his hands for money?
188	191 61 146 180 88 160 33 53 156 93 188	The temperature is only 40 degrees.
188	10 154 97 36 137 50 70 152 24 68 188	That looks like a stupid invention.
188	113 32 116 53 132 187 179 89 212 10 188	These people look lame.
188	50 89 136 169 76 193 200 53 75 162 188	The blue and white color scheme makes one feel frigid.
188	187 6 54 73 10 201 176 85 214 84 188	My snake would love those mice.
188	16 60 47 119 126 110 177 145 59 63 188	Those birds look nice, I guess.
188	179 76 70 207 13 137 39 81 141 73 188	It looks calm out there.
188	190 178 213 43 109 110 165 92 74 34 188	I don't see the appeal of sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.
188	182 15 107 142 66 58 40 183 36 84 188	Thoses old cars are on really good conditions.
188	106 162 99 15 169 141 73 165 131 183 188	What a sad little hut.
188	88 93 136 165 187 177 66 42 114 96 188	Looks like another open house. Probabably more annoying people shuffling in. We dont want them.
188	155 91 152 84 148 145 96 1 172 92 188	The White House has a traitor in it right now.
188	170 143 95 55 104 182 54 4 193 146 188	I hate traffic.
188	90 54 53 169 76 43 95 122 118 198 188	That's a pretty boring paper craft.
188	2 31 165 205 13 141 39 146 88 194 188	I have been to mountains just like these, could not stand it really.
188	141 168 74 12 67 114 69 213 194 40 188	I think it looks ugly
188	36 146 13 51 205 65 49 139 141 159 188	I really didn't care about this dock. so glad they tore it down.
188	57 210 159 44 141 26 67 195 77 10 188	This pool is as empty as my soul.
188	158 28 123 132 209 49 13 207 107 111 188	That looks unappetizing.
188	5 161 123 174 95 91 178 35 61 193 188	i dont like this picture
188	191 116 100 119 108 164 78 2 102 210 188	He looks like he forgot his lyrics.
188	167 9 24 200 195 74 53 179 132 12 188	I would not put out these decorations
188	215 83 206 136 128 125 157 86 28 204 188	I honestly don't see why people care about nature.
189	25 94 168 145 127 136 60 80 161 165 189	I really hope I don't jump off this building.
189	158 28 182 9 151 69 164 46 130 53 189	Those clothes are so fancy!!
189	154 158 26 74 59 57 103 107 2 79 189	You did a fabulous job on those letters!
189	61 8 161 143 203 128 134 4 198 78 189	And here the lofty geranium slowly withers in the scorching heat!
189	109 143 188 60 16 73 103 11 106 122 189	Why are they in such a straight line! I swear mind control is real.
189	187 11 212 145 101 135 77 14 76 124 189	Let's fight robot!!!
189	29 143 159 211 37 89 161 61 31 63 189	I wish I could go away for months
189	167 174 59 105 8 192 152 187 46 182 189	That looks refreshing, but I do not want to think about drinking for awhile.
189	106 88 16 143 136 172 215 68 6 176 189	How did they build it so high and narrow?
189	109 77 34 212 52 15 2 188 170 25 189	Beautifully designed atmosphere with a lot of thought-provoking symbols.
189	14 8 166 181 76 88 127 133 31 190 189	Let's finish by smashing the equipment!
189	120 4 206 59 152 84 134 174 32 6 189	That girl is going to fall in those heels!
189	89 215 146 50 166 77 165 161 87 3 189	I always like to be see family movies with full of characters.
189	85 104 96 99 139 199 49 154 97 198 189	The ivy on that building looks as if it is eating away at it!
189	134 19 187 207 162 168 105 135 120 76 189	This picture seems like the owner of the house just got back from the desert where he buried something important like a chest or a body!
189	4 91 206 192 6 177 132 63 127 21 189	Not enough pizza
189	163 35 15 19 36 29 125 180 203 116 189	I will like to act like another person.
189	16 27 77 8 165 147 5 93 181 111 189	If I was being strapped in like this, I might just explode!!
189	127 194 125 105 7 139 11 198 10 128 189	These people are going to change the world!!!!
189	150 103 129 48 94 201 102 56 192 178 189	A lovely piece or artwork
189	61 156 134 35 107 121 97 143 179 77 189	This boy is planning to rob a bank, I can see it in his eyes.
189	154 164 36 158 151 8 108 181 24 40 189	This is the only flying hospital
189	24 112 204 115 132 99 140 85 207 79 189	How can they even hold her up?
189	38 27 199 78 132 195 141 138 182 92 189	The game is very tense.
189	65 183 188 132 157 112 161 199 177 31 189	This person is completely different off stage I'm sure, something amazing about stepping up to perform and entering a new persona, it's like you can project your dreams for the few moments you have attention.
189	157 63 39 187 101 170 89 124 80 202 189	he looks very ill
189	12 101 138 18 208 125 27 182 139 178 189	I cant believe my car broke down for the 100th time
189	79 127 70 182 48 121 193 132 160 143 189	Splendid looking display!
189	68 65 90 201 172 96 154 44 146 204 189	To jump from a height into this water would be overly dramatized
189	191 215 173 167 174 40 121 36 77 93 189	WAHOO!! Way to go getting your degree!!
189	165 200 65 173 105 150 13 103 3 129 189	The heat is so brutal
189	164 36 61 88 157 201 152 108 146 213 189	The restaurant sign is very inviting.
189	5 89 204 174 207 73 197 7 32 95 189	This looks like such a serious event. I think he's telling them all the secrets of life.
189	136 185 41 72 74 66 76 21 159 14 189	I would jump out a window.
189	66 140 37 135 45 110 126 46 202 105 189	this is a good statue
189	175 157 86 120 65 130 196 93 89 161 189	Those people look like scary zombies! I would be nervous to walk around them!
189	108 199 195 4 140 3 38 8 123 36 189	Those blocks are the greatest thing ever.
189	62 148 153 8 59 109 129 116 205 128 189	I can't believe this picture is so old.
189	157 13 178 14 76 55 42 10 201 173 189	The memorial was the most depressing thing I've ever seen in my life.
189	149 193 84 136 128 173 17 107 115 143 189	The tire tracks make it look like someone spun out and died.
189	51 31 132 207 71 93 7 48 39 169 189	This is just the most beautiful looking house and pool that I have ever had the pleasure of laying my eyes on!
189	89 197 52 60 42 115 46 4 11 201 189	It was great till I was overcome with nausea and vomited across the audience.
189	151 62 141 202 35 99 65 84 79 120 189	Scene from a murder movie
189	94 58 117 111 55 167 77 148 184 47 189	You don't want to miss me!
189	196 102 115 148 147 38 172 25 169 75 189	someone could get injured
189	182 121 157 85 104 87 107 114 56 142 189	The sun sets on another day without my true love.
189	58 100 22 85 214 26 114 144 150 188 189	they dance slowly
189	10 9 20 69 124 85 22 182 157 162 189	i hope the truck doesnt fall over into the tent
189	206 139 88 116 69 89 180 62 123 154 189	It is so obvious the man is faking.
189	147 18 162 126 91 78 54 8 40 90 189	The black and white in this photo is so artistic.
189	89 109 154 188 199 64 31 65 13 6 189	Wow, she looks just like a shoujo anime character.
189	142 74 79 60 68 153 192 209 214 122 189	figues, it's kawaii.
189	35 84 60 80 128 179 98 19 29 154 189	oh my god. i'm going to hell for sure
189	154 187 164 25 98 8 191 143 156 13 189	The person has no reason to creat eny dialogue while not being built for it
189	40 151 124 154 57 155 176 42 7 134 189	Why are they not even looking at each other. Breaking up?
189	31 142 53 24 62 179 148 188 93 166 189	The kid's opening of the present isn't dramatic.
189	196 8 169 56 10 23 24 53 160 202 189	These colors are almost identitical to the scary, poisonous looking butterfly that landed on me in the forest.
189	69 120 167 140 126 2 107 208 14 46 189	they may fall off the ledge! be careful!
189	63 178 88 139 2 109 123 126 199 167 189	A bridge like spider web
189	119 115 182 139 131 107 7 140 37 146 189	What a great amount of twists! Wonderful imagery and colors! I am so stunned by this photograph I could just die!
189	165 111 44 124 210 3 150 192 37 114 189	The world move's on a woman's hips.
189	186 81 198 55 20 144 200 64 180 72 189	I don't appreciate these stairs being made to look like a sideways Y.  That's totally sexists against the X chromosome.
189	106 205 163 179 117 86 63 62 74 153 189	That is such a tall building.
189	123 104 115 133 180 85 87 124 116 140 189	This is me every morning when I wake up.
189	202 116 49 161 169 66 159 57 162 183 189	Life is black and white.
189	89 16 44 53 157 167 7 101 195 92 189	What?! Do these exist now??? Why didn't anyone tell me?!
189	74 187 78 84 88 186 53 1 205 201 189	Don't trip on the wires!
189	98 47 115 150 121 19 152 26 214 209 189	Right after this selfie the power went out and we sat on the train for two hours.
189	70 75 21 94 147 42 162 29 39 198 189	Officer Miller is heading to war, fearful she may never see her family again.
189	168 136 214 77 109 134 65 112 71 198 189	They're doing a great job dancing here!
189	213 6 203 95 83 104 58 69 180 128 189	Oh my!  How wonderful they are playing together.
189	164 138 176 118 110 191 34 56 172 153 189	The extravagant cathedral spire
189	96 2 30 138 31 21 24 114 140 194 189	Someone is taking their role in a musical a little to over the top.
189	170 3 23 131 81 8 145 115 34 62 189	You can feel a sense of the diving in that striking cloudbreak.
189	123 45 134 28 48 56 143 162 187 167 189	That picture is a little Dramatic
189	114 200 103 2 43 107 188 56 38 37 189	Those are too close together.

191	71 200 106 103 158 96 51 105 132 161 191	I wonder how much this cost..
191	108 187 31 203 42 103 177 155 59 13 191	That pool is expensive.
191	131 32 8 207 100 187 67 152 105 176 191	This is going to break the bank to clean up
191	26 78 111 75 190 16 115 162 175 120 191	This display must have cost a fortune! Not to mention the damage to the grass!
191	2 84 51 129 47 118 202 74 211 96 191	I can't imagine the financial investments needed to make this a reality.
191	10 129 188 64 207 62 163 96 148 190 191	A lot of birds were killed so I could make this pot of cash.
191	122 190 75 48 129 87 106 152 185 189 191	I would love to build a resort here!

191	33 147 132 151 44 144 167 17 150 68 191	Wash dishes by hand and save money.
191	19 39 165 208 17 117 175 205 80 67 191	What a waste of money to paint a rock
191	156 55 155 145 129 151 118 149 185 207 191	You can impress a lot of people with the right boat.
191	111 76 60 200 193 187 61 55 73 30 191	So now I see local fresh flowers, not yesterday when I needed them! Trader Joe's robbing us with $10 "bouquets" of dead flowers. I'm going broke shopping there!
191	3 54 62 79 13 142 25 180 195 63 191	Who spent money on fake turf for this area?
191	27 119 30 129 183 165 47 14 208 199 191	You need to secure your trash cans to prevent scavenging.
191	26 63 199 175 198 159 201 195 50 208 191	Those apartments are classy and luxurious.

191	73 84 107 179 201 52 177 158 105 96 191	A solid group of professional networkers here.
191	142 187 29 90 14 211 169 58 93 106 191	Okay we need to make sure to collect those cans afterwards for those five cents each!
191	160 96 33 111 203 70 80 115 123 45 191	Bet they saved a lot of money moving this themselves.
191	207 66 120 42 122 5 128 44 81 47 191	This should save some cash
191	41 101 161 116 86 79 188 114 214 137 191	This painting seems like a good value. Looks like they had a good lunch.
191	106 147 192 177 84 136 14 50 39 69 191	This land must be worth a fortune!
191	22 113 204 177 151 173 110 108 51 130 191	This place probably makes a load of cash. A racing museum should have a lot of expensive cars
191	117 42 79 92 113 132 13 66 109 108 191	I bet those windows cause some huge electric bills.
191	13 6 150 168 43 137 61 178 112 88 191	The value of these bikes is enhanced by their custom seats.
191	118 38 20 135 165 29 215 123 93 214 191	That looks much too expensive
191	22 66 10 45 103 90 3 18 196 54 191	Good they are finally tearing this down, room for new businesses!
191	90 164 101 30 19 55 172 63 58 143 191	I wonder how much those portraits cost.
191	194 156 13 14 97 67 207 36 54 184 191	You can't get far with comics. You're better off doing graphic design.
191	164 205 121 181 210 95 86 192 167 213 191	Taxpayer dollars at waste on horses of all things.
191	148 93 137 146 41 95 188 54 116 3 191	I could catch that and sell if for big money!

191	65 61 214 208 211 179 128 5 167 6 191	I'm sure I could get a better bike for less than he paid.
191	176 215 115 213 28 67 151 114 74 152 191	Some would say that money grows on trees.
191	165 35 90 179 152 53 38 64 75 52 191	How much did it cost to enter the race?
191	108 111 166 154 188 74 204 134 5 12 191	Some money making opportunities happening right there!
191	66 121 52 133 175 149 170 163 93 45 191	This place looks too expensive for me.
191	67 61 164 100 91 102 107 77 185 51 191	Those haircuts look inexpensive, maybe they are trying to cut back
191	45 129 79 51 17 82 72 212 27 49 191	The property taxes are not going to break the bank.
191	90 116 87 76 91 50 183 21 152 1 191	I work a second job waiting tables to make side money. On the weekend nights I can make more than a whole weeks worth of minimum wage hourly pay.
191	45 175 210 127 86 137 16 64 158 154 191	How much is that worth?
191	147 94 184 143 24 183 173 28 9 15 191	This event is totally worth the money!
191	132 207 67 16 47 62 157 82 32 176 191	The winner should be given huge amount
191	103 142 172 34 37 31 87 108 20 132 191	Those flowers look expensive!
191	74 73 161 26 123 139 201 175 87 198 191	Pretty interesting way to go off the grid!
191	5 139 22 9 92 182 90 85 215 89 191	I want to have his bank account.
191	140 181 79 65 144 58 16 84 104 199 191	I can't wait to see how much money we made from this show.
191	39 56 65 124 68 8 162 148 57 111 191	This place looks so pristine and beautiful. I wonder how much the upkeep costs.

191	126 72 91 139 120 46 172 111 53 70 191	That must have been expensive back in the day.
191	47 50 143 122 72 198 160 161 61 106 191	I would clean this up myself to cut back on the cost of paying someone else to do it.
191	104 153 3 202 205 71 78 169 117 28 191	I wonder how much these fish can be sold on the market?
191	80 167 88 10 203 186 33 73 55 107 191	Money Dirty Of Colour The Like Look That

195	123 139 105 135 41 22 28 40 187 3 195	It looks very cold out there
195	47 187 171 12 213 155 39 49 104 84 195	This color has some bad connections with some memories I have.
195	115 53 206 158 182 107 129 82 50 20 195	Think of all the office workers stuck in those buildings working away...
195	48 121 101 118 120 129 147 151 202 132 195	The dolls are fragile.
195	152 75 208 88 166 56 173 10 44 128 195	What a contemplative, natural site.
195	23 199 29 171 82 214 25 190 150 144 195	A fancy place
195	182 212 164 168 121 3 123 42 171 149 195	Looks like their kids are well behaved, I hope they are finding family friendly things to do together.
195	158 191 109 14 37 146 205 135 160 66 195	I hope they arrive to their destination safe
195	200 55 112 183 57 110 46 73 153 23 195	Adapting can be quite painful for me leaving something i'm use to.
195	37 25 213 170 126 114 108 150 182 167 195	I remember this beautiful place in Costa Rica.
195	141 22 146 126 115 154 106 50 193 16 195	Checking who won
195	38 182 212 190 122 4 32 215 16 28 195	Poor fellow looks tired.
195	125 101 148 145 151 196 203 7 154 68 195	This is where I like to go to think about things.
195	178 137 184 16 91 1 133 17 24 132 195	Orange makes me very nervious.
195	140 155 78 50 15 31 60 191 34 162 195	I hope this is just a model and not a real thing.
195	35 192 76 59 4 126 37 114 180 3 195	What a lonely looking figure. It makes you wonder what he's thinking as he rides down the street.
195	110 90 206 133 175 185 68 80 138 202 195	A beautiful spot.
195	22 80 79 199 164 104 211 208 194 177 195	My grandfather looked like that man. I am sad now seeing this man.
195	77 158 172 74 188 21 147 175 156 72 195	It's so great to see children and adults sitting together as one.
195	110 196 171 207 122 169 75 42 66 2 195	The wall appears to be very rough to the touch. I would not like that texture against my skin.
195	16 72 91 167 9 50 89 58 74 123 195	That looks like it could hurt!
195	4 143 63 70 10 182 21 117 44 71 195	such a delicate flower.
195	119 164 78 108 14 4 201 181 153 206 195	The emotion in this picture is intriguing.
195	201 84 176 27 65 183 80 8 34 59 195	Crucifixion carvings like that always terrified me as a child.
195	97 118 43 173 81 120 18 129 55 202 195	I love the way he looks when he plays. You can tell how much soul he puts in to it and it makes me cry just thinking about it.
195	177 158 153 136 95 212 49 55 201 15 195	It must be hard to live in a hut. Imagine all the bugs, and illnesses that could plague the area.
195	64 204 57 168 133 68 101 145 35 135 195	I hope that whoever flies that can handle a nervous passenger..
195	2 76 70 204 106 188 167 130 42 32 195	It's just... So, beautiful, I feel like I may cry, the trees, the buildings, it's so wonderful. I'm starting to sob
195	8 16 79 49 15 129 85 59 10 186 195	I hope they are checkin the safety of the seat belts on that car.
195	168 124 193 26 160 45 138 151 94 88 195	I feel a bit offended by this glove; it's basically pollution because it's just sitting there.
195	45 112 75 134 164 17 48 24 194 63 195	This is such a sweet wedding photo!
195	117 50 13 24 182 154 169 36 196 71 195	Lovers dance the night away
195	130 200 63 6 23 22 119 179 185 138 195	It reminds me of an old saying my grandmother had. Strong foundations are not made out of wood and sticks.
195	100 46 64 108 211 9 180 212 59 105 195	The fox was abandoned by its mother, and taken in by a coyote.
195	110 9 198 37 106 49 3 71 182 4 195	People love their city so be careful of what you say
195	212 125 17 59 173 168 71 165 56 114 195	I hope the motorcycle passenger is holding on tight, that looks risky!
195	73 1 49 203 59 96 146 211 56 177 195	This view is so beautiful, it totally touches my soul.
195	153 77 135 58 26 89 137 207 52 204 195	The boy is loving his little parrot.
195	86 131 130 167 14 56 207 12 88 108 195	I love birds
195	69 34 51 33 96 18 36 215 144 122 195	it is so romantic in italy
195	57 197 126 69 127 55 150 81 26 33 195	My friend is a very emotional and easily touched person.
195	96 25 86 139 88 60 71 27 67 29 195	How vulnerable he looks
195	142 71 168 20 185 37 205 39 210 150 195	This is so cute and I would love to have something like that made for me!
195	170 185 45 89 17 70 164 73 191 123 195	They need to be frird
195	115 112 134 186 181 191 160 175 73 46 195	I feel left out because I want to sit at one of those stools.
195	12 16 63 214 178 66 168 163 164 131 195	Feel the breeze, hear the voice of nature all around you.
195	126 136 28 36 27 124 14 156 26 30 195	Crossing into my home state.
195	141 35 147 107 93 159 8 79 104 171 195	There are too many people there. I wouldn't go anywhere where there's bound to be people around me rubbing each other's elbows.
195	5 117 176 190 29 163 175 188 91 42 195	Family time is the best
195	182 79 46 151 140 28 121 109 177 120 195	This flower turn me on
195	55 145 34 65 166 112 126 103 67 102 195	That room looks scary, I'd never go in there.
195	8 77 215 192 202 107 111 113 130 155 195	Oh, look at that building. I bet it has seen a lot of love in it's day.
195	157 51 149 64 38 210 113 83 205 122 195	hopefully no one bothers them
195	193 106 179 134 207 115 198 153 107 182 195	What a great ceiling with a lot of art.
195	74 56 112 163 116 171 92 13 185 29 195	I love attending parties or events especially the food.
195	12 46 26 47 116 144 4 25 157 171 195	i am not sure I could get my blood drawn

195	123 167 10 26 128 203 54 81 175 210 195	So precious a child with there father
195	45 111 3 44 50 74 58 121 176 40 195	The bird seems fragile
195	191 65 179 28 210 175 4 115 57 102 195	on a day like this id curl up inside and mope
195	190 39 4 79 14 175 107 101 35 19 195	The ocean is very powerful, SUP riders must be careful
195	17 200 129 169 44 94 66 131 13 170 195	This view is so beautiful that I could cry.
195	136 58 87 139 151 138 173 126 174 76 195	I just want to cry that sign is so beautiful
195	141 112 117 36 21 212 62 67 97 6 195	He looks like a compassionate youg man.
195	109 150 136 101 97 66 167 186 59 174 195	I am afraid of clowns.
195	108 7 99 33 109 137 210 131 180 163 195	I try not to tread too heavily on the steps.
195	138 178 150 59 209 172 141 179 33 40 195	The craftsmanship is so pristine and elegant.
195	122 36 180 27 144 121 108 190 31 63 195	These lights are nice and dim.
195	77 85 18 74 178 113 169 72 148 27 195	I am  feeling quite  sensitive  and  sad this morning
195	14 184 84 121 200 119 24 191 104 47 195	The building meant something.
195	62 153 75 25 138 46 130 66 9 203 195	We must do everything to protect these beautiful creates that we can

198	191 142 118 194 60 129 52 159 16 92 198	I would totally skateboard down that 6 stair steps.
198	54 18 163 214 145 152 165 187 37 193 198	I hate pizza with that many toppings

198	133 214 146 14 117 7 143 44 128 174 198	I bet if I threw a penny off this it could kill someone

198	16 60 172 108 201 163 171 84 28 62 198	this chick feels good
198	4 15 154 213 119 87 11 195 75 202 198	I have an urge to push this guy into the water!
198	203 193 72 92 98 167 84 46 90 183 198	I should definitely pull the fire alarm! It will give me some attention that I've been craving.
198	143 141 128 120 140 144 101 122 139 114 198	Can you find Waldo? Where's Waldo?

199	127 16 29 19 171 173 103 12 135 10 199	I'd enjoy riding through the rural countryside alone on a bike with no cell phone service.
199	23 2 73 212 213 89 37 25 185 46 199	I think this might be a fun vacation, but I don't know what I'd do there.
199	166 208 1 111 81 163 83 123 15 18 199	You go unc!

199	129 93 43 112 23 159 36 191 110 63 199	Beautiful even though i'm not religious.
199	88 91 214 49 126 142 172 9 1 196 199	I spent half my life on trains
199	2 34 164 22 9 71 183 31 129 56 199	That man must be enjoying his time. I might want to do that someday.
199	205 108 43 115 177 10 55 163 32 167 199	What a fun festive party they are having.
199	128 32 28 117 130 163 93 70 207 167 199	This guy looks so friendly, I bet he has good ideas on different topics and I would like to listen to his speech

199	135 22 42 151 80 156 85 178 57 56 199	Imagine the clothes are not properly folded.Its just bare
199	66 13 160 79 59 56 12 74 43 104 199	I would love to experience this location in person. Beautiful.
199	63 132 183 80 212 141 46 94 98 157 199	I bet these girls know how to have fun.
199	188 159 205 174 125 202 49 60 141 107 199	We welcomed the announement to go dance to the music.
199	182 17 142 119 208 163 49 58 34 73 199	I feel like these fireworks are exploding like my loving heart.
199	151 128 87 42 105 119 207 71 145 45 199	I wonder if this counts as jay walking?
199	88 203 114 179 30 149 124 48 213 180 199	The architect should appreciat
199	73 131 136 9 63 174 177 209 79 62 199	I would ask these people why they don't enjoy the environment if I was in that park
199	105 198 204 57 38 9 73 32 165 113 199	Wow I think I'd love to visit that place
199	152 201 122 79 163 142 161 171 71 39 199	She should be able to do whatever pleases her.  We should all be respecting of her choices.
199	86 94 158 130 180 7 122 50 58 182 199	I was in a place like this once and found love
199	193 101 210 72 128 118 14 173 117 40 199	The model posed for her first photographic session unsuccessfully.
199	57 38 215 141 121 123 176 112 193 78 199	What a fun place this looks like.
199	35 23 204 44 178 200 191 126 60 187 199	Hmmm, I wonder what they're making here?
199	153 13 80 120 214 30 171 215 179 143 199	He reminds me of my son.
199	167 150 128 21 31 102 122 176 55 208 199	What a great looking turtle!
199	185 137 11 177 143 141 146 41 103 150 199	open the heart to share with others
199	121 23 166 94 73 135 193 186 92 122 199	The boy is an open slate.
199	113 129 118 4 197 156 140 57 22 128 199	Anythme you need help just ask
199	4 132 150 74 136 55 162 138 184 69 199	The leaves look so beautiful, Fall weather, I love that time of the year.
199	139 155 15 11 58 145 4 165 150 67 199	The look on his face.... sometimes I feel like that.  I have a lot of problems.  My life is very difficult.
199	171 101 2 181 141 124 13 70 203 10 199	This color blue is inviting and imaginative.
199	36 187 59 25 41 128 176 46 80 12 199	Seeing babies makes me want to have one.
199	159 147 64 1 65 73 164 20 61 168 199	What an interesting take on such a common everyday object.
199	67 145 206 9 88 178 16 76 64 162 199	The train ride was very out in the area.
199	22 159 202 200 52 125 27 212 13 46 199	I love to see new people who live lives like this, different to my own.
199	27 187 85 90 24 54 194 137 121 4 199	Looks like this would sound great!
199	29 22 115 98 102 187 207 107 208 70 199	There appears to be enough room on the train, but if it is crowded, I would not mind sitting next to someone to help with space.
199	46 198 20 17 126 30 41 213 84 9 199	I wonder what kind of bird that is, it looks interesting.
199	119 162 25 167 186 164 140 64 33 53 199	There are so many opportunities in an open space like this!
199	117 76 44 203 110 146 115 26 24 155 199	This doesn't look like my jam, but I'd try any music at least once.
199	34 37 90 164 93 178 190 10 202 78 199	The little girl look so cute with her face paint on.
199	99 163 150 196 86 37 48 98 131 81 199	Down-to-Earth, natural, practical
199	29 58 46 181 109 6 19 188 95 179 199	vintage camera in pristine condition
199	34 169 102 202 35 81 186 131 98 160 199	thats a cool shade of color
199	195 71 145 158 98 132 52 160 190 178 199	I would like to visit here someday if I could.
199	173 57 75 203 182 128 51 112 70 61 199	A good place to meditate
199	167 62 123 59 128 203 181 122 3 8 199	What are they looking for? I'm so curious.
199	97 139 114 105 162 127 155 59 124 7 199	This field makes me think of the vast universe.
199	9 135 35 58 99 140 1 10 182 179 199	Listen to the message and follow the positive vibes.
199	209 46 201 98 213 163 174 16 135 214 199	This is what my office looks like, it's simple, but it's me!
199	122 206 69 27 205 195 1 57 187 40 199	I wonder what led her up here, going for a hike? I'd love to travel here sometime.
199	42 155 67 57 200 126 193 166 4 47 199	Who put these rocks in my path?
199	56 71 126 80 152 138 10 136 161 42 199	i wonder what kind of beautiful bird this is?
199	109 186 149 64 9 45 203 193 210 106 199	those tomatoes are fresh
199	59 7 43 29 144 58 214 76 21 192 199	I would be willing to try off road biking sometime.
199	83 127 205 147 102 163 91 197 74 28 199	Where's my digging equipment?  No telling what I might find!
199	201 48 162 107 38 140 108 124 167 75 199	I would love to try carving a stone like this one.
199	50 28 156 1 202 115 80 125 81 90 199	I'm receptive to this, I think they're trying hard to clean things up.
199	125 59 122 181 134 142 213 65 178 136 199	The gorgeous window makes me feel open to inspiration.
199	149 66 17 100 10 144 137 38 61 187 199	This building has a lot of potential to be beautiful with some cleaning and updating!
199	36 125 59 5 75 50 80 43 17 126 199	Everyone was welcome on the boat all shapes and sizes.
199	64 63 141 59 210 183 34 133 158 103 199	The front of the vehicle is exposed
199	126 41 112 100 40 145 78 173 51 38 199	I love that vase.
199	6 96 168 192 57 113 195 4 12 35 199	It may be disturbing to look at, but the use of animals for food helps sustain human life.
199	80 168 92 124 112 49 212 68 40 98 199	What a wonderful congregation; you should come join us sometime.
199	136 37 214 182 142 51 200 207 155 197 199	It'd be interesting to spend a night under this.
199	128 85 6 72 124 29 130 30 201 95 199	THIS LARGE WOMAN SHOWS GIRLS THAT THEY CAN BE BIG
199	187 19 82 94 113 93 34 181 76 150 199	The family album shows all of us at the family reunion.
199	144 86 37 134 138 195 184 43 177 200 199	The jersy looks a little baggy, but she looks like shes having fun.
199	93 33 102 187 52 143 166 165 104 87 199	it looks different but im up for it
199	31 24 126 160 84 151 165 210 46 65 199	This display of remembering people's deaths are very creative
199	211 113 73 139 43 92 195 212 132 130 199	They look happy.
199	101 144 151 185 4 88 79 153 119 126 199	Interesting view. I wonder what the photographer was trying to capture in this.
199	64 52 95 76 39 43 97 36 186 17 199	Education is so important! Children need more parks like this so that they can really breathe in the knowledge with some fresh air.
199	209 17 203 163 57 83 198 119 45 195 199	I love the arts of any kind!
199	15 12 209 23 162 196 145 90 4 63 199	This wall has an intriguing design that makes one wonder about its function.
199	13 102 18 22 203 63 138 6 193 89 199	An open window symbolises readiness for life.
199	107 8 57 37 78 72 68 33 15 21 199	I would be willing to experience this place or any other place for that matter.
199	44 37 151 68 139 129 89 79 106 157 199	I feel her pain.
199	186 55 12 6 32 62 146 128 200 9 199	I'd like to know a lot more about the history and people involved in this old building.
199	24 32 190 149 117 67 88 101 168 83 199	He wants to check his pee-mail.
199	191 109 12 173 39 83 49 128 146 30 199	I have never worn those types of socks, butI bet they are comfy!
199	93 190 144 98 158 171 36 149 168 141 199	Something about this makes me want to run up in there Jon Snow style. I wanna see what this is about.
199	135 193 88 31 181 207 11 92 60 108 199	This landscape looks interesting. I'd love to learn more about it.
199	136 35 139 73 184 144 27 148 56 59 199	These animals look so well rested and relaxed ready for anything
199	125 66 4 156 96 135 28 92 18 187 199	Sing it to us!
199	57 141 54 44 158 85 76 7 190 146 199	I've never been to a restaurant like this but I am wiling to try anything! It smells great here
200	191 7 92 203 97 45 87 169 76 188 200	Get your foot off my drum, if you didn't buy it then don't touch it.
200	84 141 156 186 164 102 16 213 59 24 200	No that was not funny
200	36 174 97 137 83 108 124 150 94 9 200	That lion is way too close to that mirror. Please, someone move it.
200	96 210 176 169 2 159 180 104 195 17 200	Some may say they like this image, but I would tend to disagree with them.
200	133 121 72 137 95 160 152 178 52 94 200	Ugh, those are not fangs.
200	151 76 100 165 51 22 124 88 23 182 200	This giant stadium is definitely a huge waste of money.
200	183 89 174 75 19 133 121 63 100 110 200	I can guess the context of this drum circle more accurately than most I'm sure.
200	160 86 75 154 167 45 163 56 191 211 200	one tree and around the compound wall and the seesaw
200	141 191 4 40 44 206 162 137 60 148 200	What an ugly flower!
200	185 195 154 58 171 160 101 121 210 122 200	No, this is not TED Talks just shut up and listen.
200	136 80 182 51 174 78 134 131 180 129 200	Anyone who thinks this was taken in Newfoundland is out to lunch.
200	79 207 46 142 113 60 76 9 14 194 200	Wow could this be any more filtered?!
200	183 16 212 147 116 79 143 68 112 205 200	Well the sun isn't quite down all the way yet.
200	33 184 90 96 142 91 175 81 174 124 200	I really hope I don't fight with my dog but if I have to i will win
200	27 178 41 109 213 42 7 146 28 128 200	The photo is kind of bad, to be honest.
200	12 36 74 70 133 101 104 162 119 31 200	They need to make bigger buildings in this town.
200	74 97 79 118 168 206 101 182 48 174 200	I don't think this is a great color.
200	13 142 153 54 48 12 205 85 84 42 200	Be careful leaning there boys!! You are all about to swerve and do the domino!!!
200	136 129 186 11 113 125 214 145 104 111 200	How was that a good idea. The contractor should have made the blocks go all the way.
200	198 38 152 57 215 32 34 1 143 205 200	That can't be from the outside, it has to be from the inside of the house.
200	85 154 29 192 13 28 90 100 88 99 200	I cannot tell if this is a painting or not, but that's definitely a runner on there.
200	109 142 129 158 130 125 59 8 176 156 200	Women should have long hair. I'll debate anyone that doesn't believe this!
200	63 205 159 54 181 81 28 152 198 97 200	This is a total mess.
200	18 12 167 14 142 188 116 127 26 17 200	I would love to be in the middle of that argument,
200	54 64 167 109 23 63 101 103 214 9 200	I bet the stone is not wet
200	24 54 149 206 5 81 29 110 35 124 200	This is the best you could do, featureless, with slots. great, just great.
200	59 41 10 127 156 4 157 68 110 51 200	Can you be any more green?
200	94 215 32 204 167 91 24 85 143 174 200	If you like this... I'm ready to fight you.
200	83 113 23 2 150 49 45 116 194 159 200	Is this a beautiful flower or what?
200	204 174 177 124 210 183 158 45 21 61 200	those fruits dont need to be there
200	184 84 126 211 37 51 189 181 169 23 200	I bet that water never gets high enough to touch the tower.
200	142 39 124 15 155 3 172 106 94 88 200	Paintball isn't really a sport, its to easy.
200	51 182 34 157 70 74 107 8 179 32 200	The lake is not a good place to raise a family!
200	173 119 168 82 205 7 122 191 172 91 200	Nice green park
200	105 150 212 81 44 42 157 171 41 18 200	The water on the road is not much
200	126 179 86 38 163 185 213 134 133 8 200	I doubt this man made those beautiful baskets.
200	1 103 42 143 76 168 80 20 7 50 200	THIS SINKHOLE IS SO COOL
200	194 73 47 36 154 167 196 137 168 186 200	I think this could be a little prettier.
200	88 79 212 109 132 174 6 42 183 84 200	I told you I do not like puzzles.
200	46 175 125 206 71 180 105 44 95 57 200	this girl irks me!
200	59 169 157 47 49 206 112 181 77 208 200	Everything about that doll is wrong!
200	59 170 207 63 150 81 123 79 111 75 200	If he wins the footrace again, I will tell the other runner to do much better.
200	111 153 140 90 46 209 6 127 92 152 200	Even though there's an arrow on this trail maker, I think it's the wrong way.
200	106 1 112 16 83 24 163 81 50 119 200	Why are you making grandma have to sit down?
200	214 31 193 163 127 46 61 157 186 149 200	This vehicle seems like such a waste of money, it must be nice to have the luxury!
200	69 87 114 110 157 4 103 208 207 202 200	They're not even friends, I bet
200	62 160 115 120 133 163 150 156 34 19 200	I don't see what's so great about this, modern art is much better.
200	115 152 173 139 190 103 111 162 5 6 200	Stately wall keeping secrets inside.
200	184 199 89 9 206 43 214 58 35 164 200	[RETURNED]
200	126 47 135 112 73 123 63 26 182 205 200	These people just need to have better technique
200	23 194 64 164 80 166 184 118 192 3 200	This lady should get out of the photo
200	106 76 2 198 186 191 190 202 70 140 200	Marriages never work out. You might as well get divorce papers now.
200	53 211 21 78 136 152 210 114 79 12 200	The design is like a tunnel
200	64 156 149 207 212 153 173 35 198 68 200	This is an ugly tree, whoever says otherwise is an idiot.
200	75 104 56 112 135 32 66 101 176 138 200	That has to be the worse bridge architecture I have ever seen. Tell me I couldn't do better.
200	135 111 154 180 166 21 10 182 193 44 200	You think this is a good pic? Lol
200	16 123 18 15 160 156 147 143 144 212 200	I can't believe these players are so argumentative today.
200	214 150 30 149 68 85 96 179 87 57 200	Not a fan of the outdoors. This picture is so cliche.
200	111 74 84 154 188 104 169 211 43 179 200	The yellow car is not as good as the red car.
200	187 9 38 194 72 157 100 44 106 76 200	The main view of the shows an tyranny of intrigue
200	178 35 44 155 116 108 68 167 113 175 200	NO, you shouldn't have connected the pipe there!
200	55 43 35 149 83 186 208 177 213 145 200	No ref that was a bad call
200	10 54 3 191 160 11 83 77 187 52 200	Stores should clearly display prices, or they're asking for me to argue.
200	126 63 188 124 129 45 43 25 23 9 200	This isnt a photo of anything. Why post it?
200	90 38 6 129 82 206 117 71 168 24 200	Whoever planned this room is a fool, why have a desk directly where the sun hits you and why in the world is it blocking a door?
200	209 205 171 83 139 91 5 184 124 208 200	It wasn't supposed to be this stormy today.
200	7 161 5 143 149 132 204 11 124 185 200	This is the best color. I'll fight you if you don't agree.
200	7 129 118 49 149 182 74 93 181 28 200	TASTY AND SPICY
200	129 68 43 144 3 40 90 164 30 169 200	Why are residents doing the police's job?
200	31 89 152 197 122 55 10 80 193 198 200	Many of my friends used to believe this was the best background color for their AIM buddy profiles, but I told them they were wrong. Hot pink background was obviously superior..
200	172 88 61 165 71 49 77 107 73 146 200	These 2 are always fighting over this bone.
200	212 182 87 10 137 36 12 186 166 121 200	Is this bike safe? It looks as though it has been built with the bare minimum parts. I know too many people who have been in motorcycle accidents, especially poorly put together ones.
200	45 88 210 90 151 13 7 131 127 137 200	These flowers do not go together
200	111 142 18 208 41 161 100 132 4 122 200	Why are you not reading a book in that hammock?
200	149 43 41 21 158 2 131 154 9 215 200	What is the reason for this building to be so close to tracks, makes no sense.
200	209 44 22 31 83 143 33 81 186 6 200	Why do people want to save this type of nature, it's honestly ugly anyway who cares.
200	16 21 203 186 117 169 67 83 177 181 200	Who would take a shot like this of a baby feeding? Are they trying to be funny? This looks so weird.
200	7 168 32 27 25 53 115 107 182 121 200	the place down the street does it better
200	24 44 109 78 53 143 192 48 173 181 200	The middle car is BY FAR the best car of the three. The other two aren't even close, they are ugly and useless. The middle car is the greatest and that is a fact.
200	99 29 47 187 178 156 189 41 118 11 200	I don't trust anything about this stuff.
200	106 12 133 66 156 211 116 86 100 60 200	Why are your kids wearing shorts when it's cold outside?
200	188 122 76 196 63 43 66 56 107 202 200	The man in the sunglasses shouldn't be looking at the group. It's obnoxious that he is looking at them.
200	99 1 50 117 104 155 65 30 213 18 200	I clearly touched first
200	15 7 41 59 34 99 61 35 97 159 200	There is a kid, yes I said a kid, not an adult, looking at the ceiling.
200	48 15 170 165 2 78 14 102 193 25 200	No doubt the plant is in the plam family.
200	118 24 63 214 80 69 205 93 56 159 200	Why don't we replace these stone buildings?
200	153 102 118 66 51 20 56 52 119 111 200	I would wear this dress on any occasion depending on the demand
200	34 166 104 30 117 107 61 187 192 172 200	I don't want to argue about flavors.
200	61 175 48 166 115 169 194 130 63 209 200	Why would anyone not like such a view? Crazy has to be it.
200	129 55 166 107 124 131 209 78 31 101 200	There's no way this is going to get anything productive done. Everyone there should stop wasting time and just leave.
200	46 121 165 50 153 207 209 81 99 74 200	Green is such a bad color for baby clothes, I'd argue that parents should stick to more common colors.
200	136 153 181 104 183 172 122 152 6 82 200	Ummm, no, little boy. You have your cars lined up all wrong.
200	15 69 154 37 107 169 132 145 129 91 200	I said wood not freaking tile
200	106 27 113 7 101 79 47 17 19 180 200	This is a good wine! No it's not.
201	110 176 130 67 191 25 140 11 158 18 201	I like to bite the heads of these things because I am a scary guy.
201	177 51 192 12 55 140 63 125 153 17 201	Like the sky being set on fire
201	177 80 48 44 113 163 105 67 104 148 201	And there was no one left
201	18 161 89 13 93 138 4 47 151 51 201	Little did the eater know he was to about to ingest some deadly salmonella.
201	26 23 2 123 50 115 58 63 203 74 201	I would be scared to leave my bike there.
201	182 97 176 117 77 68 172 212 200 188 201	I have no desire to be anywhere on that bridge.
201	96 2 10 199 78 38 142 176 35 139 201	I hope he doesn't get injured!
201	136 5 50 202 35 107 124 54 188 158 201	what if the sheep falls!
201	32 134 119 101 163 63 16 197 76 9 201	I can't wait to see them get at each other.
201	107 94 146 151 215 31 71 67 142 120 201	the fireworks are exploding very close to those houses. They may cause some damage,
201	198 21 167 196 83 118 23 93 2 116 201	Gotta outrun all these voices in my head.
201	143 26 43 196 65 106 29 187 88 200 201	It is bright at night
201	93 140 42 22 39 204 117 48 9 55 201	I hope the cargo doesn't fall.
201	132 199 137 87 34 93 109 110 171 42 201	I would never eat the food I'm too afraid
201	145 34 5 66 18 100 69 21 121 179 201	What are they planning? I bet I know..
201	85 162 96 60 55 62 167 69 115 31 201	The unknown awaits me...the dark shadows illuminates the area.
201	62 95 145 191 2 12 138 199 96 147 201	This would be the perfect place to hide a body
201	161 26 87 210 129 10 43 19 57 44 201	fun, exciting, nervous
201	26 53 8 183 158 146 51 68 165 147 201	This kind of scares me some.
201	2 16 86 131 95 177 137 213 93 101 201	This is really creepy!
201	188 102 134 209 193 186 29 172 146 153 201	THAT BLUE COLOR MAKES ME WANT TO SNAP!
201	198 109 176 44 206 48 148 89 80 141 201	Someone could just push you right over that edge and you could die.
201	67 214 154 135 78 109 210 194 128 100 201	I bet she will cut you with those nails
201	87 83 169 3 7 159 167 47 26 84 201	What a scary pumpkin. I am so frightened by this I want to close my eyes.
201	75 135 197 206 27 137 174 140 105 52 201	i see the face in the snow, do you?
201	189 72 153 29 65 22 145 98 44 34 201	Wax figures maybe a bit too detailed; I always feel like they are watching me!
201	171 150 9 79 103 169 168 40 22 189 201	she looks like a ghost
201	139 133 183 9 186 73 96 144 25 24 201	Is that a fox? That's really scary!
201	207 180 91 68 132 133 25 137 7 182 201	These ruins look so terrifying, I would be scared to see it in real life.
201	147 124 180 5 22 142 115 23 203 204 201	This baby should be a little more scared of getting in front of people swinging.
201	181 207 204 101 22 1 25 154 192 109 201	I hope the weather doesn't turn south.
201	173 77 115 172 156 51 197 16 87 52 201	So, my beauty mask was a bit of a scare this morning. yikes!
201	29 153 17 110 75 56 16 119 19 105 201	I would never eat at a restaurant in a tropical location, too risky.
201	59 154 160 103 66 109 91 71 171 137 201	The statue is kind of scary.
201	70 128 138 181 176 49 97 115 170 160 201	Nice spot to abandon a bad date.
201	20 193 116 93 5 99 214 188 52 173 201	The building is terribly high.
201	22 186 159 90 140 16 83 66 188 168 201	It's so scary to think that somene almost backed into that car
201	98 186 90 197 3 207 32 152 166 5 201	Nervous about speaking
201	193 190 170 9 73 205 200 38 210 93 201	I may have started a forest fire once.
201	133 35 127 45 172 154 189 81 2 4 201	They're really adorable.
201	125 164 138 113 120 26 36 95 88 68 201	The fairy sculpture is very pretty yet mystic.
201	202 138 125 83 164 101 135 143 52 5 201	This is a beautiful picture... but what if you fall overboard?
201	149 29 119 194 32 162 42 115 88 153 201	I want to throw this guy off of his bike.
201	137 211 72 5 179 46 180 212 21 156 201	I want to scare that guy so that he falls from his snowy perch in the mountains.
201	39 54 205 43 169 3 71 160 31 202 201	You're going to need a shot of this after you hear what kind of horrible things are happening right now.
201	195 161 200 134 40 164 15 169 10 177 201	id be scared of falling in there
201	204 200 127 103 199 192 132 213 202 48 201	the character on the left is so scary looking i think i am going to have creepy nightmares tonight. i do not want to look closely it is giving me the heebie geebies,
201	213 174 130 204 128 91 44 92 37 143 201	Not so scary color
201	21 72 46 137 33 186 6 92 50 44 201	ouch what is in that?
201	63 106 129 31 17 85 49 175 177 38 201	This totally looks like a haunted farmhouse.
201	57 176 76 200 82 8 27 186 155 111 201	These horns look like they are very loud. They would scare me!
201	62 170 192 204 49 54 103 146 53 120 201	Wonder if the phone has an emergency button?
201	65 10 157 86 67 168 31 170 39 81 201	This picture makes me think of steps descending into someplace you don't want to go; i.e., a detention center of some kind.
201	68 156 107 198 203 38 160 108 87 179 201	The final moments of a match is always scary to watch.
201	70 31 143 10 68 176 117 87 42 89 201	that chair will break
201	202 160 2 108 82 122 156 143 162 93 201	I'd hate to get this place dirty.
201	157 128 114 16 74 166 212 18 108 150 201	i would be scared of falling into the river
201	151 157 141 77 85 150 110 161 192 24 201	Eekkkk! Blue screen of death.  I hope my laptop isn't dying!
201	34 91 56 59 173 113 16 89 15 45 201	Why are there three of the same?!
201	215 118 34 128 6 112 140 209 179 30 201	Someone has to free this girl, she's trapped!
201	180 69 35 84 6 196 147 176 211 50 201	I heard that if you read the words on someones tomb, without knowing what they mean, you can get a curse put on you.
201	102 214 134 178 44 135 125 1 28 60 201	Older transit systems
201	197 103 91 56 95 169 16 79 117 160 201	All I can imagine is falling into that lake and drowning
201	186 143 59 66 207 133 47 135 152 101 201	One of them is about to murder the other.
201	86 78 15 197 73 79 188 8 71 150 201	I am looking at people on stilts and I am afraid of heights
201	17 23 169 13 187 180 163 197 118 138 201	This shot would be the man on the right's very last...

201	139 39 150 200 125 124 7 74 213 110 201	IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THESE THINGS ARE POISONOUS.
201	2 178 152 144 153 54 100 188 189 183 201	You could be poisoned by these.
201	6 175 156 78 115 192 18 103 91 185 201	Why is he looking at her like that!! If he touches her, I'll punch him!
201	162 125 177 20 121 12 172 24 143 118 201	Living on the edge.
201	188 96 100 60 25 116 103 167 93 47 201	It could blow up at any moment
201	134 88 101 115 52 2 18 70 159 9 201	She felt so frightening during her treatment.
201	152 206 21 141 203 53 89 210 96 209 201	Beware this neighborhood
201	119 28 24 150 26 62 189 92 160 106 201	Soon the waves will crash over and destroy all
201	61 193 134 82 55 211 202 215 18 119 201	I am a little scared of going to this area of town.
201	135 140 1 69 185 95 36 73 51 24 201	Those lines in the photo look dangerous.
201	183 88 208 23 66 135 15 31 125 76 201	I could fall off this and really hurt myself
201	90 84 185 35 83 207 128 124 51 75 201	All these groups and I'm left out. Let them plot, they'll learn to fear my scorn in time.
201	211 189 60 106 113 29 98 123 24 45 201	I am not even going to peak behind that fence!
201	71 123 188 130 25 42 192 36 10 4 201	I'm gonna come over and you wont imagine what i'll do
201	77 212 16 194 164 61 122 190 132 195 201	This cannot ever happen again
201	178 128 53 47 162 32 43 78 200 84 201	Large crowds like this would give me so much fear and anxiety! You never know when you are safe.
201	52 186 203 145 75 48 57 97 35 133 201	That would scare me
201	206 190 109 119 101 100 74 149 86 121 201	Those kids look so uninterested, are schools even trying to engage students anymore??
201	105 48 100 4 156 196 53 209 92 139 201	1 word... werewolves. Of course that's just one of the many horrors waiting out there on a dark night like this.
201	62 194 12 16 21 145 58 133 34 130 201	"The clutter of this medicine cabinet is terrifyingly unorganized.
201	168 164 167 162 23 36 84 117 153 114 201	The music wasn't turning on.
201	104 90 134 36 215 164 204 137 160 84 201	looks like my place after someone has tried to excape
201	38 193 137 186 131 46 6 87 9 64 201	I have a bad feeling that something will jump at us any minutes here.
201	162 58 89 137 22 83 209 152 183 114 201	This is so dangerous! I hope they're staying safe, they're not dressed appropriately!
201	117 102 10 71 5 69 213 93 143 128 201	What is about to happen could be very bad!
201	60 129 127 133 195 117 199 65 76 122 201	I'm so scared that man is going to take all of his clothes off!
201	66 134 175 70 41 110 116 145 154 120 201	What an idiotic picture, it's just blue! I wish I could kill it!
202	176 168 22 193 53 66 133 104 14 139 202	Who made those awful looking cookies
202	146 152 83 140 120 196 70 107 106 155 202	This building is the location where the robbery took place.
202	169 36 110 155 168 163 115 181 122 201 202	i dont even like the forest
202	107 79 166 119 2 165 197 160 172 128 202	That poor dog.  I want to beat his owner for leaving him out there.
202	201 162 148 75 183 157 97 90 72 156 202	The soldiers are ready for battle and war.
202	122 80 206 182 111 30 181 96 184 88 202	What a dumb idea to light such a big fire.
202	98 213 121 187 138 21 131 40 51 136 202	it is difficult to assess his emotion now
202	145 63 157 100 68 83 209 3 176 150 202	I'm going to attack that ship with my hands.
202	55 60 210 204 111 154 126 41 182 28 202	Another day in music class
202	100 175 200 173 19 164 52 201 22 1 202	What an ugly city!
202	85 62 158 123 111 173 210 81 186 121 202	This is ridiculous! Why are they showing us this dumb picture?? It makes no sense!!
202	166 204 182 131 210 62 155 160 180 136 202	This room is messy. Clean it up now!
202	52 24 76 99 161 3 66 193 44 144 202	I hope this building falls on these guys!
202	95 42 54 34 172 86 58 4 23 9 202	That pattern is horrible!
202	186 6 104 132 211 159 64 141 173 201 202	If only we actually took care of our planet.
202	116 117 27 161 90 177 170 73 181 164 202	I could take him in a fight.
202	198 2 152 146 167 199 69 178 60 193 202	She is taking it all wrong. Idiot.
202	196 99 42 8 74 60 14 82 93 148 202	I'd love to punch this guy.
202	102 138 106 149 90 39 210 33 174 201 202	I hate birds like these always pooping everywhere
202	86 133 46 93 32 199 176 60 65 31 202	I hope someone slips and falls here.
202	197 64 93 99 63 97 59 109 112 28 202	I can't stand the look on that guys's face.  It just makes me want to punch him.
202	48 27 10 161 130 163 169 78 105 18 202	Angry Attack Defend
202	192 156 47 9 177 214 89 179 150 48 202	I am so angry I could strangle someone with that rope!
202	175 116 148 95 91 174 35 200 159 126 202	I am not a fan of those few rooms with lights still on; I do not appreciate them looking at everything
202	49 93 156 146 125 116 10 117 43 31 202	You aren't at the beach, so put on some clothes!
202	13 149 96 178 49 64 206 150 112 69 202	I don't like the fact that the door is missing half of it on the bottom!
202	91 112 32 150 187 70 39 20 76 93 202	Slam his body into the side and get the puck.
202	112 119 17 103 128 80 200 40 198 140 202	A fat old man
202	174 210 37 84 6 58 160 64 28 103 202	This will end badly. They better get control or I will take care of it myself.
202	6 46 141 29 66 162 103 86 124 170 202	I love the city but the people their are unfriendly
202	128 175 198 183 135 215 101 48 163 19 202	I don't trust them there.
202	77 84 209 161 46 14 7 67 141 57 202	These fans are the enemy and their team will be trounced.
202	56 31 68 179 145 126 26 112 121 50 202	get these protesters out of here
202	116 106 10 87 48 179 92 201 79 173 202	The sun has gone down so be careful or else.
202	188 29 144 25 24 49 70 141 110 42 202	I would rip the green off
202	29 28 191 201 185 198 190 174 162 6 202	So many signs wouldn
202	196 107 50 110 71 46 182 164 101 1 202	I'd never want braces, they're so painful!
202	87 157 95 94 81 3 26 127 11 141 202	I really dont like rock music.
202	181 86 9 73 149 203 186 127 89 77 202	DON'T HIT THE POLE.
202	17 166 63 28 187 37 42 160 49 69 202	That building in the background absolutely ruins this peaceful picture of nature.
202	179 133 116 149 186 2 18 176 197 27 202	I would be so mad if there was not enough parking like there is not here.
202	166 205 53 126 161 34 170 209 90 23 202	Man this looks like a great spot to setup an ambush.
202	10 195 122 93 57 188 178 113 127 6 202	I hope that building burns down.
202	28 171 130 74 73 92 193 117 123 149 202	Is this meant to be "art" what a load of rubbish - I'm so tired of junk being considered art, waste of everyone's time.
202	170 3 111 22 210 94 165 140 36 28 202	THAT IS HECK YHE EHAT
202	45 37 82 53 3 197 43 97 177 13 202	Dont enter my ring I will destroy you
202	83 88 178 200 6 123 16 15 148 214 202	A light to protect people from violent criminals.
202	55 145 133 210 195 151 205 93 67 76 202	I can't believe someone bent these pages in the book.
202	98 24 181 87 165 133 174 25 182 111 202	This car in front of me better get out of the way.
202	118 43 53 69 26 102 73 7 175 37 202	What are you looking at? If you have something to say, say it to my face!
202	160 59 2 61 169 5 40 200 32 193 202	I hope she loses the game, she is no good!
202	207 17 112 119 50 157 156 88 89 128 202	This picture just looks flat out stupid.
202	215 88 170 61 157 123 26 144 149 145 202	Clubs are not a good time.
202	180 137 205 95 163 106 85 65 124 93 202	The brightness of the purple is making me angry.
202	164 52 62 72 35 131 30 41 187 178 202	THAT STUPID THING STUNG ME!
202	95 191 63 183 102 197 124 152 93 118 202	Only those without a life take pictures with stupid mascots
202	193 208 200 87 201 110 183 151 132 180 202	the child is looking at us
202	137 29 119 3 124 134 205 98 111 73 202	I hate it when people pose over water. Why do people insist on engaging in dangerous photography?
202	70 155 9 10 54 142 69 4 87 200 202	This is the stupidest, worst nook I've ever seen.
202	128 111 78 193 152 63 168 186 182 4 202	having fund in a hostile environment can be dangerous in a weather like this
202	194 198 207 42 128 66 167 92 56 70 202	Getting the war zone ready.
202	83 144 4 46 181 53 57 140 119 183 202	Look what you have done?! The world is 90 degrees out of kilter.  Horizontal water fall, your fault.
202	61 182 145 195 23 212 84 34 178 58 202	I want to set that on fire.
202	106 136 35 64 65 121 130 44 173 167 202	This guy is gonna bomb onstage.
202	108 185 170 192 98 149 105 172 68 124 202	They could all be pushed into the water
202	154 196 62 90 5 146 180 101 151 38 202	What an ugly piece of "art"
202	50 48 55 74 38 131 108 13 66 162 202	Who does that guy think he is giving the peace sign? It's so hot out here.
202	103 118 198 3 196 159 60 210 76 166 202	I can't believe these guys are mocking the evening news!
202	121 98 69 2 64 139 41 85 157 42 202	This is a stupid picture and task.
202	76 57 60 96 82 38 83 117 22 87 202	Those shoes are terrible! Why are they holding a shoe in a book store?? What are they thinking?
202	8 211 172 174 25 164 110 130 114 33 202	Is the thing they are holding alive?
202	208 1 211 151 95 215 174 190 148 127 202	This can never turn to a forest
202	127 133 205 56 158 165 92 190 20 105 202	I hate public displays of affection.
202	68 12 48 74 22 178 23 54 167 120 202	This man better stay away from my sister!
202	134 103 44 189 211 192 112 81 41 171 202	Unclean, unkempt. uncouth
202	127 163 196 14 67 44 160 103 177 108 202	Next time try not blocking the view with a tacky rain gutter.
202	88 101 192 154 189 209 131 112 3 213 202	I hope the balloons pop.
202	165 112 188 114 97 91 207 93 73 167 202	Tennis is a sport for preppy babies with too much arm strength.
202	102 78 8 63 208 154 172 3 19 23 202	No one would go out with him, if they no how unsafe this route was
202	100 29 191 16 185 68 79 118 179 4 202	The people look so rude
202	39 38 139 189 7 152 145 30 119 132 202	This looks like a great way to take a nasty fall.
202	128 167 131 165 43 3 50 189 151 127 202	I bet that horse bites them.
202	5 45 16 82 103 111 109 196 78 101 202	Purple is the best color, agree or your a clown
202	71 201 44 84 55 59 119 190 108 212 202	Those lights are horribly blurry.
202	44 102 193 73 133 121 181 76 77 24 202	calm down girl..stop yelling
202	62 39 155 45 169 28 154 209 99 98 202	We need to shut down these factories no matter what
202	160 3 62 108 103 126 158 23 122 174 202	Why can't she just go away!!!
202	36 156 112 161 204 70 206 105 102 152 202	Why would you be laying in the grass with nice clothes on?
202	125 36 113 111 83 70 150 172 71 84 202	It's dangerous to have flowers outside the fence.
202	55 25 140 186 149 59 19 180 7 175 202	live the life as our wish
202	6 115 116 171 30 182 151 95 199 96 202	This picture is awful and I would never visit this location.
202	24 52 80 62 44 188 6 112 136 121 202	I will throw all of this out right now.
202	55 87 1 117 164 77 108 201 89 212 202	Her hat is ugly.
202	44 181 142 45 22 9 53 157 111 33 202	Who else had a sockembopem when younger
202	190 51 97 25 21 30 81 119 186 98 202	too many people here
203	92 62 199 8 73 91 76 57 1 127 203	I believe this is on someones farm
203	10 99 35 171 103 184 55 31 7 195 203	A collection from enemies
203	21 26 110 147 83 29 151 164 146 2 203	These people look like they have no money.
203	142 134 30 57 58 185 68 84 118 66 203	Awfully complicated numbers
203	74 158 104 117 194 200 156 204 171 67 203	Im not good with fancy computers
203	128 150 170 50 84 3 184 36 4 177 203	I like that little rocket man
203	177 113 60 155 102 40 158 180 44 160 203	The tower looks like its from the 1950s.
203	81 100 20 49 127 108 213 163 112 56 203	There is way too much going on in that sign.
203	171 184 18 19 134 6 213 168 38 73 203	Nothing like watching a sun set over a corn field.
203	164 158 60 8 147 126 144 101 24 176 203	This city is too big for me.
203	49 25 63 152 137 155 157 99 17 161 203	Fields feel like home.
203	193 35 178 81 211 89 112 41 179 13 203	Is that a spaceship?
203	48 157 149 70 143 191 30 190 161 134 203	I love being in the woods like this. It brings back old memories of camping in the great outdoors!
203	63 173 108 48 103 82 28 30 160 159 203	This shark made out of Legos is quite amazing
203	147 176 118 183 136 142 113 155 168 115 203	What does that say? I don't get it
203	104 129 162 47 59 45 32 93 139 86 203	This guy wouldn't survive in a small town.
203	64 59 61 56 124 152 12 195 55 16 203	That things gonna fall apart
203	45 143 77 112 66 88 188 4 186 177 203	There seems to be too many things going on, visually and physically, in this small space. It's a little overwhelming at first, considering my environment is usually more open and clutter-free - but also engages curiosity as to how others can function in what looks to me as a small chaotic area, but would be considered normal and enjoyable to the people in this photo.

204	201 90 212 166 173 208 179 25 121 31 204	I could go on vacation here.
204	172 31 180 97 88 90 11 5 27 170 204	OMG this is so neat!!!
204	133 183 27 92 144 30 67 159 23 36 204	That kid looks pretty happy.
204	110 104 138 43 1 87 85 35 29 187 204	Who would think you could get a photo like this?!
204	73 107 122 159 91 148 58 69 1 84 204	Congrats girl! We should train together for next year's games.
204	27 146 15 179 81 96 47 161 128 186 204	Here we have one of the most beautiful coast lines in the world!

204	10 47 162 139 123 68 201 72 151 4 204	Just chop and fry
204	129 179 76 82 117 143 99 152 137 213 204	What a great baseball player! He is going to make it to the big leagues one day!
204	63 190 101 91 85 117 70 164 145 135 204	This is a thoughtful and cutely planned wedding arrangement.
204	177 184 134 64 55 175 24 118 176 21 204	How unusual, a group of street corner musicians.  I bet they sound extraordinary.
204	9 201 179 159 130 19 89 170 135 146 204	I remember seeing images like this in architectural design classes at Cornell.
204	139 70 11 210 72 181 134 178 159 146 204	This is such an incredible scene - you can practically see the unbelievable love they have for each other!
204	134 14 111 42 5 199 95 143 176 132 204	This is the journey of a lifetime
204	89 163 94 27 88 177 144 186 122 106 204	I think their laziness is crazy.
204	158 135 91 151 124 51 180 143 175 145 204	My new initiative ensures every child in the nation gets fresh fruit for the summer.
204	44 54 205 22 47 161 102 77 184 136 204	So HUGE, it is INSANE, this is beautiful architecture!
204	137 170 205 82 206 123 1 183 203 113 204	Now THIS is a musical performance, let me tell you.  None of the smoke and lasers, just the amazing magic of music travelling through the air!!
204	10 76 85 119 34 49 120 41 91 56 204	The military rewarded her for her gallant efforts during the war.
204	6 148 30 71 20 197 52 55 65 54 204	The awe of nature is wonderful.
204	171 170 68 160 89 122 203 202 31 73 204	I know people more than anyone you will even meet, and I'm telling  you that lady looks like a nice person.
204	145 94 155 134 1 91 32 133 38 126 204	It appears that someone has hung a drum on a building; how spectacular. What a sight!
204	138 15 150 104 20 184 102 73 25 10 204	I'm sure they're discussing something important about the previous play.
204	121 146 92 26 7 102 38 86 185 15 204	I love this photo! So many interesting implications.
204	25 213 98 140 59 135 26 202 191 153 204	This seems to be such an amazing bathroom. I could imagine doing fancy things on the counter.
204	212 10 12 39 152 115 100 200 73 35 204	A plate of food is shown in the picture.
204	208 15 190 175 96 213 20 123 62 82 204	This is a building I visited on my amazing trip to the orient.
204	128 206 168 51 112 136 26 185 170 166 204	the lights and trees make this a perfect place to be
204	144 58 72 119 167 19 108 114 157 198 204	looks like a peacful ride
205	101 108 156 129 122 79 209 84 105 203 205	there is a lot of grass that can be used for feed
205	113 196 42 143 11 131 119 145 138 130 205	The bed being next to a cabinet like that is very useful.
205	23 117 95 147 21 30 22 26 50 105 205	It's cool you can move to the right if it rains.
205	139 68 163 40 66 58 22 120 65 60 205	I wonder if this could be made into a material.
205	115 185 151 117 175 188 77 122 75 8 205	Yould hike here. It may take a while to contemplae your life decisions.
205	127 17 119 16 43 79 211 94 179 25 205	It is important to consume multicolored vegetables everyday.
205	40 170 156 113 4 42 29 14 46 120 205	This is fishing weather
205	149 179 85 94 56 31 106 207 198 162 205	All the zebra are grazing in their respective herds.
205	178 49 100 12 7 155 18 69 8 43 205	Should bring a sweater on a night like this
205	35 119 166 9 85 33 120 20 50 145 205	Having two cats be friends is very useful.
205	79 183 155 10 59 186 159 134 81 67 205	I hope you know how to get out of there
205	197 118 72 140 67 154 159 20 21 208 205	Thats a normal building design.
205	80 123 10 93 144 154 174 12 126 91 205	Now why would anyone have their dogs leashed if they are not holding the leashes?
205	161 25 111 179 108 34 110 58 116 40 205	Future leaders in times of crisis.
205	213 68 69 4 102 25 160 91 10 134 205	This is an image with no purpose, really.
205	1 76 42 73 173 139 12 90 116 135 205	That is one crazy looking car.
205	8 25 121 154 59 52 153 18 134 179 205	Those roads look a bit bumpy
205	121 100 215 144 172 118 11 112 164 168 205	This butterfly can stay here until the human reaches up a hand or moves suddely to disturb it.  It's toes could get caught in the webbing of the strap too, possibly causing injury when it flies away.
205	1 92 56 86 57 166 45 97 213 126 205	Good thing she won't get a sunburn.
205	54 80 105 164 153 61 187 78 75 28 205	That's an attractive looking display. I wish I had it in my home.
205	69 194 86 67 91 50 62 143 169 138 205	what are they exactly looking at?
205	42 41 112 123 45 191 3 83 55 170 205	It's a good thing to get to the airport early enough to watch your luggage being loaded while you wait.
205	74 5 142 28 135 127 100 112 7 166 205	She looks like she teleported in from the 1800s
205	154 165 173 161 204 167 134 159 106 37 205	Hopefully that doesn't start a fire.
205	117 165 11 189 140 62 157 180 63 128 205	Keeping an eye out for potential predators.
205	118 172 97 6 178 155 15 186 193 112 205	It's not safe to be taking a photo while driving.
205	48 74 66 114 170 62 189 184 212 29 205	I bet that person is tired of chasing kids.  He probably needs his own wheels.
205	132 8 182 61 72 54 119 172 74 5 205	Confidently striding down the fairway towards the putting green -- he might score a birdie for this hole.
205	53 50 21 198 61 57 140 164 48 153 205	This looks like a video game screenshot.
205	191 46 4 186 79 203 63 207 148 100 205	That ideal I came up with makes  a lot of sense to me.
205	14 59 212 183 69 176 119 190 135 88 205	It would be difficult to access these houses on the mountainside.
205	102 120 54 158 28 125 157 63 82 121 205	THE BOATS ARE GOING SO FAST AND THE ONE GOING THE WRONG WAY WILL CRASH.
205	50 179 3 174 157 108 203 99 191 156 205	This is a pretty thing, but of no real use to me or anyone so therefor undeeded.
205	212 129 7 127 163 27 194 6 121 145 205	This landscape is likely from a European country.
205	209 43 6 57 163 92 109 201 30 39 205	The traffic light will soon show red color
205	198 208 197 53 132 28 143 43 157 47 205	It would be so much easier to watch the concert if the lighting was better.
205	183 202 190 90 152 14 13 49 127 44 205	Very real and pragmatic image of a neighbourhood
205	198 12 199 32 177 196 48 142 115 8 205	Great way to save on gas, and add on to good health!
205	142 14 169 35 94 190 139 26 98 53 205	Oh, this looks like a handy tool to use.
205	36 197 22 160 157 185 4 95 40 94 205	Good idea to have a light post on the street corner. It makes sense for it to be here.
205	131 121 156 169 202 36 139 197 208 104 205	The girl is very applied.
205	153 165 14 197 55 104 17 112 162 121 205	I would think this would be appropriate for a living room.
205	196 54 78 50 16 31 141 94 185 197 205	This is a good food for vegies
205	203 145 173 112 97 210 156 192 111 153 205	Good organization, but more art supplies would fit in there.
205	117 190 26 166 206 139 29 114 118 51 205	Hopefully she's teaching him how to tie a tie.
205	209 53 71 151 166 101 14 34 75 123 205	she is a woman
205	10 143 137 21 22 155 120 121 136 60 205	I totally could go without the Nutella.
205	185 137 172 62 81 30 10 170 17 23 205	Sometimes, you can tell the depth of the water by the apparent color.
205	29 107 175 169 81 19 34 179 71 26 205	What a practical bar. It has everything I need to serve all of my guests.
205	138 60 187 76 78 54 24 99 81 147 205	That letter in the middle of no where is actually pretty handy as a landmark in case someone gets lost.
205	167 187 5 44 136 184 148 156 198 114 205	Don't stand in that part of the field
205	137 186 153 111 83 22 180 52 60 11 205	I think it's time to get a new door or refinish the old one.
205	159 86 78 60 82 74 174 91 69 17 205	That basketball player should just give the ball to the taller guy so he doesn't get hurt.
205	188 38 211 203 156 140 23 104 101 136 205	is that in the mountians
205	35 6 134 89 94 32 78 188 156 207 205	It doesn't look like he's wearing a helmet. That isn't safe
205	41 99 39 146 60 152 140 195 3 29 205	I bet this bands music was pretty cool.
205	144 26 69 42 24 98 147 165 91 151 205	I am glad to see he is wearing his helmet
205	100 67 200 47 115 71 138 34 82 88 205	What would be the purpose of this?
205	93 206 78 116 165 143 99 120 4 186 205	A starfish that looks like a star.
205	179 43 183 182 66 46 70 126 189 61 205	The cars parking under the shade are lucky, it won't be as scorching inside on a sunny day like this.
205	9 187 182 97 18 209 210 31 84 36 205	You should submit this to the paper
205	178 130 16 87 198 188 197 43 142 17 205	what a pretty bird
205	178 151 189 63 52 38 81 19 33 157 205	Looks like a bowling alley score card.
205	9 192 22 43 185 42 116 80 189 151 205	Why would you leave items sitting there?
205	57 70 37 168 74 101 161 32 191 96 205	I bet a lot of people live there
205	3 147 167 19 116 38 139 101 197 37 205	Sailing is a great way to exercise.
205	61 25 212 89 9 8 191 58 32 29 205	This art is great for this space.
205	27 34 68 15 187 86 200 20 170 129 205	Field lacrosse is best played on grass as opposed to artificial turf.
205	58 188 189 61 194 97 137 48 5 11 205	Biden seemed like a guy with a good head on his shoulders.
205	6 61 42 50 147 62 154 157 29 54 205	everything you could possibly want on one ship
205	50 1 152 107 105 211 97 191 213 91 205	A male and a female walking down a sidewalk.
205	33 209 196 168 214 87 149 163 51 171 205	It's not smart to take photos while driving.
205	163 129 137 54 10 111 161 47 143 127 205	That  looks like a great piece of property, until you need milk, have an emergency, or need to take a kid to school everyday.
205	27 126 135 113 29 157 44 16 184 134 205	These boys are friends
205	86 53 72 71 25 99 180 161 109 68 205	That is a lot of dishes in the sink.
205	111 174 11 82 107 210 62 166 32 36 205	This place will be cool
205	54 203 37 133 45 77 150 68 140 154 205	In the long run, plastic cups cost more than ceramic or glass.
205	196 69 78 65 98 52 110 13 24 161 205	They should probably be sitting in the chairs while they roast the marshmallows, or else they risk getting hurt by losing their balance.
205	39 79 83 60 29 46 41 174 27 80 205	That pond is much too dirty to swim in.
205	103 74 2 133 27 159 198 18 92 35 205	The Pig 7 whistle is a solid, mid range pub with big personality and believeable ambiance.
205	195 188 84 92 66 78 12 150 126 128 205	The woman is preoccupied with something in her hand as she is looking down. The man finds something intriguing in the distance.
205	100 70 75 43 49 16 198 151 38 134 205	Where's the four leaf clover when you need it?!
205	210 201 108 85 176 77 197 65 164 109 205	The headband is lovely but it won't last the day. Too frou-frou.
205	89 43 155 159 67 186 3 101 79 26 205	Does this path go all of the way through? I wouldn't want to go off-track.
205	89 194 191 152 187 88 198 160 207 21 205	sure.. we will be there
205	124 178 113 60 144 209 146 97 24 32 205	I don't know what this guy is doing, but he is very strong and fit, would make a good worker.
205	184 59 13 174 37 98 194 12 127 166 205	Sitting in stuffy suits is not my idea of a productive time.
205	1 181 31 195 61 40 72 79 176 14 205	You are going to need more napkins
205	150 146 129 200 1 18 112 25 197 104 205	This location looks like it has many natural resources to live off of.
205	4 106 99 130 71 50 61 198 157 30 205	should cover uncooked meat
205	115 198 30 23 199 6 175 90 124 39 205	When you want 20 flowers in one.
205	102 206 174 103 128 126 9 33 68 159 205	When we ad lib we will all support each other
205	146 70 66 116 129 154 72 60 127 200 205	you need to adjust the antennae
206	159 177 30 202 129 109 79 181 68 147 206	I think we should hire this job candidate.  She looks eager!
206	190 37 7 201 88 50 71 116 52 163 206	HAHA this is great
206	196 170 118 59 75 90 182 94 168 53 206	I love jack o lanterns!  Lets make some!
206	1 138 212 143 144 30 112 32 133 128 206	One day I'm going to learn to sail!
206	90 94 29 153 35 104 91 128 47 187 206	This is so pretty. I hope to visit.
206	52 2 88 117 126 114 121 177 55 15 206	What a beautiful little community! I would love to live here.
206	164 181 200 26 13 170 167 14 131 189 206	What a perfect placement for that poster!
206	104 5 132 144 148 76 50 168 165 56 206	Beautiful day to be outside.
206	190 107 187 39 186 30 17 140 40 35 206	I love how the bushes complement the water
206	35 90 103 95 17 21 129 178 179 193 206	I can't wait to party with the family
206	202 129 6 77 22 156 41 139 14 174 206	I can't wait to tour the top of these buildings
206	73 153 131 205 213 164 146 125 21 7 206	go team, score!
206	5 24 150 196 180 78 57 39 154 207 206	I love owls! I am glad this sign is helping them out.
206	154 106 23 27 132 165 85 150 44 116 206	I love this!
206	146 63 55 154 65 189 71 73 107 66 206	I like the black on white text far better than the white on green back home!

207	17 149 161 73 200 195 89 198 191 76 207	It's kind of scary to think that you can only see part of the image through that window.
207	131 46 28 129 17 41 34 189 202 174 207	Oh, that poor woman looks so distraught! I hope they're helping her.

212	162 155 91 98 206 200 198 74 68 136 212	Those scientists with green coats are asleep
212	67 12 214 185 101 73 93 211 95 145 212	And on the sunny day without a cloud in the sky. Beautiful
212	160 115 134 95 44 131 184 48 213 57 212	Soccer can be fun sometimes
212	140 188 166 12 71 36 126 17 178 108 212	IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY OUTSIDE
212	101 49 83 127 95 48 154 135 182 149 212	I love that game, can't remember anything about it, but I do!
212	207 185 142 193 163 66 84 126 4 139 212	The frost is casually on the window.
212	110 12 58 133 45 103 70 8 119 88 212	that's a pretty cool view
212	210 53 200 158 22 175 144 131 128 63 212	Oh, dead people. I'm so scared
212	153 209 188 85 162 186 155 97 52 77 212	fishing is cool
212	44 159 16 9 152 184 144 78 157 141 212	Such a pleasant time romping in the fields!
212	179 215 16 44 188 128 50 36 189 95 212	Brick walls with lattice - keeps it cool.
212	40 148 206 19 138 215 181 114 116 102 212	I imagine this to be casual and fun.
212	201 13 172 158 64 12 185 62 143 74 212	This is my tiny house, I need more windows.
212	55 107 189 7 62 145 162 22 6 85 212	something in the air
212	74 79 19 213 102 190 93 135 139 34 212	This man looks confused about a question.
212	109 9 72 175 168 91 105 211 197 10 212	I'd go out on a barge, why not?
212	10 210 96 136 159 133 53 122 198 208 212	The sky is so blue and the clouds are like a picture.
212	95 68 183 131 158 82 153 124 159 175 212	food items i don t  no the name
212	38 84 151 30 61 145 120 55 16 100 212	Plenty of space for peaceful thoughts
212	193 75 166 62 124 189 44 163 211 88 212	A cool brick wall which would be great to take a picture in front of
212	126 195 124 187 169 138 184 99 199 14 212	The people in the back are mysterious.
212	177 114 111 169 200 166 156 71 174 91 212	Light traffic today?
212	122 150 144 90 119 126 180 168 191 196 212	Wow it's so fun to watch kids playing innocently.
212	21 22 30 62 80 119 208 163 136 81 212	It's a good day to go mudding.
212	71 165 193 198 25 159 112 84 111 58 212	a typical creature
212	208 183 170 123 43 164 163 152 74 45 212	whew here he comes
212	112 35 154 127 88 86 197 137 53 84 212	City lights make me feel all right.
212	171 98 209 23 86 200 48 102 152 14 212	This looks like a jungle
212	68 184 17 164 119 106 43 54 128 23 212	I bet those cats enjoy taking baths.
212	96 61 32 45 7 79 30 111 149 182 212	Another day another river stream!
212	107 149 42 131 183 162 133 102 192 32 212	Just a typical monday afternoon!
212	22 144 145 99 61 179 1 7 93 46 212	A colorful mess.
212	191 31 81 125 127 41 51 117 44 110 212	you are here
212	44 155 49 196 173 183 9 63 163 67 212	Must be a movie scene
212	204 15 77 134 197 80 114 137 156 188 212	These are pretty flowers
212	93 13 143 184 112 82 37 120 7 42 212	The weather and clouds make it look so gloomy.
212	151 48 214 75 24 87 1 176 153 59 212	Usually we give her a napkin, but I kind of like the mustache.
212	87 20 53 84 52 182 101 43 139 202 212	The heartland of America
212	166 187 29 141 103 35 200 65 69 12 212	Those are some nice white flowers.
212	145 205 98 91 143 139 172 140 214 180 212	this picture is okay
212	85 66 31 98 60 116 134 63 169 107 212	Nice picture I like how well focused the camera was while in mid air.
212	166 171 16 84 99 149 101 79 66 202 212	cool show bro
212	1 88 155 199 62 68 48 54 125 200 212	yeah...lets climb it..so many branches
212	201 27 181 12 108 53 190 192 28 47 212	Welcome to the boll.
212	38 18 1 116 70 150 25 198 215 199 212	The picture give off a cute artsy vibe.
212	95 118 38 128 9 167 197 8 163 114 212	Yeah, the ocean is very blue this time of year.
212	167 96 48 126 88 127 99 179 20 198 212	I guess those peoples costumes are cool.
212	164 21 203 84 153 144 187 93 45 75 212	ehh nothing to see here
212	158 157 12 65 96 103 130 78 79 46 212	This kid is chillin and relaxed, he must be in a good mood.
212	186 194 114 126 91 49 207 10 85 109 212	Chill picture. Love the vibe
212	16 67 89 214 202 33 125 75 149 181 212	WHEN THE PLANE MALFUNCTIONED, THE AIR CAME THROUGH THE WINDOWS.
212	190 130 35 117 133 81 180 10 99 210 212	Remember, it could have been worse.
212	93 29 30 100 61 8 18 98 186 155 212	Give me a month and I could do what he is doing
212	162 53 160 205 186 35 40 87 5 197 212	The picture is nothing spcecial.
212	180 122 55 124 43 198 77 167 174 101 212	A nice stroll in the winter
212	70 196 40 26 63 190 69 210 124 164 212	A house with grass and other plants
212	16 105 71 47 142 126 108 159 119 4 212	This thing goes zero to sixty in ten seconds.
212	13 177 68 198 48 210 100 184 90 178 212	Give me a martini and a beautiful lady on water like that.
212	15 186 14 156 108 36 66 38 53 122 212	a bug's life
212	54 75 189 72 113 85 103 167 60 191 212	Photo This For Setting Calm And Cool Nice A
212	68 119 190 63 12 193 208 27 60 51 212	They look surprised to see something!
212	53 25 137 141 211 46 28 124 31 202 212	That pub looks interesting. What city could this be?
212	82 69 6 157 177 46 204 129 106 38 212	What a sight to see
212	75 202 150 169 32 133 40 63 89 54 212	I'd love to flock in these flowers freely.
212	68 163 168 176 137 130 109 140 38 91 212	This photo is nice.
212	20 38 50 115 192 9 67 93 91 82 212	What a nice family photo!
212	49 27 133 168 42 5 200 178 102 48 212	the girls are relaxed to the point of boredom.
212	56 202 143 7 92 26 1 185 33 205 212	Hey man. Great pic. Congrats!
213	162 153 61 65 19 134 15 34 23 157 213	Don't let the cat out of the bag, or I will have to squeeze him to death!
213	161 59 150 122 109 43 61 130 73 16 213	This is a good place to get rid of bodies.
213	178 129 14 125 71 3 26 119 177 46 213	That tower would make an excellent sniper's nest to pick of unsuspecting passers-by.
213	185 158 32 98 49 180 76 195 80 154 213	-86 That is way to cold for me. I'll stay right here in this warm house. How cold is -86 anyway, can you even breathe?
213	162 47 8 195 177 108 194 190 215 156 213	This snow could result in people slipping.
213	194 122 131 89 51 128 28 209 164 121 213	Crash through it
213	62 152 27 163 100 22 16 11 128 110 213	The gap in this person's teeth is wide enough to kick a field goal.
213	61 82 177 34 89 51 160 118 167 53 213	The house in the middle doesn't look safe.
213	141 21 17 10 134 13 210 15 203 29 213	I want to have her eyes.
213	157 180 149 185 39 73 55 107 212 34 213	There are probably some corpses buried here.
213	52 136 94 30 173 205 34 121 124 89 213	This house was where the brutal axe murders of the 1920s took place
213	128 130 74 17 107 72 33 191 174 201 213	Bet it would be easy to get a gun in there.
213	122 11 202 102 2 91 187 49 57 185 213	Hmmm...i think I will keep calling until i get an answer...even f it means calling every minute for 5 hours.
213	4 26 73 32 147 124 190 83 22 195 213	I'm going to jump
213	72 61 45 210 203 158 204 214 71 23 213	Hockey is such a brutal sport I don't like it
213	82 118 107 73 125 130 206 54 56 45 213	Chilling photo taken the same day she was kidnapped in the same white trailer alleged to have picked her up...
213	206 175 63 70 83 111 164 128 171 42 213	Stomp all over it lol. Be funny
213	186 32 64 9 5 82 119 143 173 176 213	I would like to beat that expression off his smug face.
213	208 211 198 45 181 133 41 47 65 107 213	They are about to become somethings lunch.
213	65 21 112 28 35 73 38 36 54 157 213	Great place for a shooting
213	118 112 128 209 215 92 85 95 185 56 213	If you play this record backward it sounds like devil worship.
213	90 13 26 205 12 165 127 20 46 67 213	I want to wear his hair as a shirt.
213	6 160 37 103 183 110 136 12 32 83 213	The ground looks slippery, wondering how this person is ridding a bike.
213	162 49 186 38 87 21 168 96 51 181 213	The building is about to fall on you! you better watch out!
213	189 94 212 17 108 190 142 211 175 141 213	There is nothing more horrifying than seeing  lot of people in one picture.
213	53 207 106 133 136 146 153 171 147 12 213	Empty like my soul... but not quite as black.
213	196 175 99 108 151 185 17 111 132 90 213	I would want to be the kid in the back. He can just hit the kid in the front with the paddle if he isn't happy with him.
213	121 9 172 144 33 79 137 3 76 211 213	He wouldn't be smiling if she slipped.
213	57 11 106 185 64 204 174 182 107 197 213	that is an ugly looking kangaroo
213	36 17 15 77 57 192 83 204 94 178 213	hopefully they don't fall
213	37 151 192 77 57 117 196 106 193 121 213	It's not fair they're last!
213	16 8 97 50 12 188 104 147 144 119 213	What is she crying about?
213	1 102 43 147 143 214 154 91 29 75 213	I bet that guy murdered people, he looks like he may like to get his toes sucked.
213	167 156 196 128 102 205 122 201 182 52 213	This guy looks like he's from the purge!
213	63 10 125 103 11 179 35 53 66 30 213	I wish I had my car right now
213	211 64 37 161 13 107 59 120 190 174 213	Colourful water creatures
213	150 51 110 29 171 105 155 198 165 72 213	What a disturbing scene! Why is that child on her lap!
213	186 177 49 23 119 19 130 99 153 109 213	This picture kind of creeps me out....the pump reminds me of something gross.
213	92 88 57 114 50 157 63 186 116 204 213	If I poured water on that, would it electrocute a person? Does the toaster in the bath really work?
213	75 181 167 48 106 90 81 199 35 117 213	I wonder how much their legs hurt
213	181 173 158 141 6 169 99 24 94 91 213	A beautiful and calm night and it is very beautiful to watch.
213	207 38 7 149 36 118 75 63 30 34 213	this is gruesome.
213	108 91 51 13 32 46 195 155 99 109 213	It'd be easy to hide a body here.
213	139 188 195 203 30 176 103 31 87 33 213	someone plucked this flower and now it will die!
213	214 104 185 113 153 69 191 47 146 78 213	I hope it doesn't snow any more.
213	128 16 176 87 8 41 119 57 24 14 213	Emotional photo shot
213	78 190 189 165 106 164 82 70 38 4 213	On such a small street, it seems like the occasional hit and run occurs far too often.
213	190 49 11 106 195 31 75 154 93 72 213	This garish color makes me think of crime scene tape.
213	77 101 20 36 39 195 124 133 74 110 213	How long until I eat this bird?
213	25 147 19 1 167 181 100 121 10 172 213	I should like to hunt them.
213	39 152 161 186 93 164 60 47 133 49 213	modern, technology, nightlife
213	187 134 71 82 3 136 98 152 188 11 213	That stick may go through his eye, regardless of the helmet.
213	40 79 126 109 187 143 9 18 123 201 213	This woman looks like a ghost.
213	175 37 212 97 21 58 144 205 72 139 213	Looks like a fun place to jump from.
213	169 101 30 8 93 65 11 48 71 118 213	I can't get over how these ice creams look like flowers. Crazy.
213	100 204 2 158 33 43 145 79 168 111 213	I think this could be a way to contact spirits from the underworld.
213	81 157 109 185 29 36 51 80 39 127 213	I wonder what would happen if someone jumped off this bridge.  Is the water deep endough to be safe?
213	109 200 196 57 25 43 148 178 179 209 213	i heard a noise
213	128 161 102 37 107 194 71 157 105 20 213	We may never know if it was a mushroom or some kind of meat...
213	97 137 194 92 98 45 143 35 105 59 213	Sugar and blue dye number five.  Nothing better for a growing kid.
213	204 60 159 10 191 79 115 97 109 139 213	Look at all these people dressed like little peasants and dancing for me...
213	163 39 215 146 68 96 45 118 28 177 213	The great co-furher has completed his goals before hsi suicide that night.
213	91 45 74 93 202 106 193 195 209 68 213	That's a great way to set a church on fire.
213	145 66 19 98 215 140 37 31 166 113 213	wheres the rest of the car
213	68 91 109 144 120 169 168 176 156 56 213	I cant believe that she is standing.
213	185 8 76 214 13 109 71 145 119 56 213	so many calories
213	209 212 60 3 26 82 99 76 154 38 213	I'm concerned that someone might get hurt in there
213	55 21 41 201 103 209 109 181 56 121 213	This camera is very off putting. I cant look at it
213	127 171 184 176 61 68 78 194 42 203 213	This is creepy and dark, probably the lair of a serial killer.
213	13 14 209 204 173 200 137 138 144 80 213	It looks like a ritual den
213	132 156 117 78 81 16 207 77 15 148 213	The entrance to an old and dark room, where no one knows what goes on.
213	136 95 175 214 135 89 69 109 10 18 213	Yum, Chinese food.
213	205 210 96 125 192 212 37 143 74 28 213	Look at those pictures. They may look like normal people, but I wonder what they are really like inside, what secrets are they hiding?
213	75 33 80 144 38 198 172 127 43 90 213	Sure these fireworks are nice but what stops a dog or child from running up and grabbing one then ending up disfigured? Nothing, I've seen the videos where it happened and it does not look fun.
213	169 39 35 190 141 79 91 96 50 90 213	Ive smelled this area before
213	19 103 70 15 109 182 125 20 132 186 213	I think sports can be upsetting.
213	10 81 181 98 134 60 203 57 65 12 213	What would happen if an avalanche blasted through right now and smothered us all?!?!
213	192 187 181 22 200 179 199 68 184 35 213	That costume scares me.
213	212 118 30 166 153 44 169 196 34 189 213	what a nice grass
213	93 61 174 163 159 166 209 115 65 157 213	Horrible, horrible, horrible people
213	110 28 163 91 118 8 86 207 205 96 213	I forgot my lunch money
213	126 134 169 19 75 123 177 202 211 174 213	Santa is gonna be off the cliff in a minute
213	171 135 17 86 172 129 211 207 188 76 213	THESE GLOW STICKS ARE DANGEROUS
213	12 139 120 40 133 177 148 81 154 55 213	This seems like the kind of place where a murder could happen.
213	187 186 28 70 73 15 91 69 110 1 213	These birds could be a sign of evil coming and of death.
213	21 29 49 183 6 44 191 87 171 180 213	the green void upsets me deeply.
213	13 182 166 110 143 35 76 64 50 146 213	Death metal rock perhaps
213	136 162 206 18 16 14 1 110 165 13 213	The blea landscape fills me with unease.
213	198 178 64 94 111 24 60 5 67 97 213	It would be awesome if somebody tripped her at full speed.
213	108 12 59 134 44 117 27 175 57 6 213	A cage has been framed to hold the office slaves as their souls slowly drain away.
213	139 40 69 210 152 132 94 39 53 123 213	What if i fell out of these windows?
213	177 180 163 139 73 72 66 6 170 19 213	I wonder if their spirits still remain.
213	82 182 53 103 169 111 139 157 25 178 213	That's disgusting grandma
213	96 121 55 178 16 163 109 88 106 128 213	What if those were all self driving cars and started attacking people?
214	208 102 195 110 163 13 15 183 100 123 214	These people look like they are having a blast.
214	197 23 36 146 63 67 108 25 156 152 214	A roof for the ground?
214	135 3 12 74 153 19 123 161 9 159 214	That color makes me laugh because I can't think of a name for it.
214	198 79 57 162 90 154 134 1 167 64 214	I bet spiderman would look cool in this picture.
214	81 132 148 98 194 184 147 114 169 175 214	This guy has no idea what he is doing.
214	122 49 38 188 179 69 166 116 59 121 214	This looks like a fun gathering!
214	210 164 12 211 155 137 29 158 134 208 214	This guys shirt is very bright.
214	110 114 50 91 109 94 156 19 101 25 214	I could not wear this around.
214	163 169 77 78 40 159 208 101 5 128 214	What is this?
214	174 159 155 136 193 146 74 195 127 192 214	I didn't know my parents were in a parade!
214	89 9 37 66 194 61 71 174 180 87 214	The sun is setting on the west.
214	26 44 145 78 129 93 81 42 9 154 214	She's blocking out the haters lol
214	89 101 136 135 16 123 202 167 179 109 214	That monument looks pretty phallic if you ask me.
214	46 66 76 212 7 75 111 128 211 131 214	I love the architecture of the place.
214	28 1 68 75 189 23 76 195 52 27 214	and my next trick is hiding between the bed and wall!
214	115 183 158 104 79 128 1 56 106 198 214	He looks like a disappointed turtle.
214	170 100 156 192 185 143 186 22 175 132 214	This is a charming piece of property.  I wish I lived here.
214	171 95 13 114 197 36 123 108 24 22 214	This car cost as much as my house!
214	30 44 51 37 207 195 142 157 187 133 214	What do you call bears without ears? A: Bs
214	209 116 20 111 151 40 58 27 148 147 214	This band has definitely been the best concert I've been to! What a fun experience!
214	208 57 205 69 188 167 34 138 168 164 214	This grave is a historical landmark.
214	135 37 149 39 58 106 167 7 196 212 214	The car is such a classic!
214	187 112 81 213 177 154 16 113 169 28 214	Ha! The person who made this image is probably still a young lad going through their adolescent angst and rage phase!
214	138 116 114 192 11 35 213 84 173 127 214	Your dog looks like a model! "This is my good side."
214	109 194 75 154 55 112 106 113 133 152 214	You are the moon of my eye!
214	84 89 35 92 140 70 9 204 170 39 214	Oh what beautiful flowers, they'll attract butterflies!!
214	56 131 26 75 201 170 67 192 55 58 214	I told you guys we'd miss the ferry!
214	146 124 150 33 96 107 44 156 10 89 214	It's pleasant to think about how much greenery is found throughout the world.
214	107 11 123 37 14 48 212 4 187 23 214	I think it's funny that the guy in the back looks so excited
214	158 136 63 181 198 45 212 127 98 87 214	It looks delicious and fun
214	128 181 85 34 190 50 95 182 84 25 214	These guys look cute when they're sweaty.
214	151 196 147 134 57 32 179 150 91 97 214	The party hit new heights when the photographer tripped over the wires on stage.
214	96 102 74 8 57 63 43 90 105 72 214	Playing with your food is always a good idea.
214	96 105 46 111 115 65 172 24 44 37 214	Quite a piece of art
214	124 64 60 32 182 122 136 178 131 167 214	Well isn't this a cute little flower? Hello, little flower!
214	215 151 82 106 91 77 17 67 115 93 214	I'VE BEEN TO HOOD RIVER AS A CHILD.
214	151 121 93 46 103 68 133 73 202 88 214	Heh, would have been a better shot if she'd been standing in the sun so we could actually see her!
214	132 199 24 5 156 178 30 15 63 205 214	haha, it looks like they tried to dress the same!
214	33 89 180 63 176 61 41 76 210 164 214	Oh impressionism you are so funny!
214	103 135 172 39 140 118 73 48 175 126 214	His beard is so long, must have taken forever to grow!
214	166 130 119 56 29 174 115 108 114 190 214	Good times at a concert, looks like guy on the left is getting ready to stage dive! Hope he can make the jump.
214	98 104 115 152 133 204 112 44 184 58 214	I wonder if there is a muse in there?
214	210 12 199 68 162 96 145 5 185 211 214	Oh no!  Thomas is running away!
214	1 110 153 90 15 157 121 171 144 80 214	The picture many different muscle proprotioned clouds pumped up before dawn.
214	28 170 147 99 166 53 95 3 106 162 214	The tables, and chairs make the people look round as well.
214	205 104 46 58 189 199 136 209 211 52 214	Green has always been such a whimsical color.
214	163 61 7 207 4 206 133 117 92 41 214	i bet those motorcycles are going too fast
214	84 61 51 114 57 29 173 101 111 134 214	The sky has my attention
214	26 111 207 141 112 51 85 203 21 8 214	love watching this very entertaining
214	174 193 66 145 162 186 117 212 8 99 214	Very tidy and all out fun with the same family members as before
214	208 116 48 11 89 165 56 6 138 191 214	I wonder if this man with the sweater is a student or the teacher?
214	167 194 140 4 127 120 133 210 1 139 214	Is that hat made of a Carhartt coat?
214	89 14 210 151 59 203 191 142 107 152 214	Its easier to find a gorilla then a needle in a haystack.
214	48 3 208 50 145 193 139 118 158 51 214	He looks like he's about to bring a word.
214	85 34 170 10 18 28 90 213 54 68 214	That pregnant woman is beating people!
214	3 88 80 147 173 191 91 179 163 75 214	I wish I could play with those dogs
214	201 205 92 193 204 51 108 94 174 39 214	His outfit is hilarious.
214	178 15 193 171 1 146 186 27 102 131 214	Who's belly button is bigger
214	29 69 142 68 158 185 198 72 100 6 214	That baby looks so happy and surprised!
214	41 69 120 133 93 52 210 95 46 18 214	Man, my eyesight is really bad!
214	185 200 97 178 40 131 125 47 101 199 214	A little light in the darkest day.
214	153 3 155 123 59 167 77 44 205 62 214	Sliding off this rock would be such a fun time!
214	115 40 182 143 146 198 195 28 16 129 214	I'm sure there;ll be someone in here , using the undergrowth cos they were caught short.
214	74 104 196 183 91 55 102 14 144 213 214	Hehe, looks like someone forgot to take their work home.
214	40 85 184 81 146 179 36 64 170 88 214	This is fun, pronouncing a language I don't speak. I wonder what it means.
214	157 200 59 165 102 166 57 99 135 95 214	Oh look, a roof!
214	43 92 94 60 119 148 156 164 212 210 214	This is me when my girlfriend says she's home alone.
214	132 135 164 153 126 68 188 24 79 28 214	I thought the crowd was pleasing
214	93 138 177 21 120 71 183 104 53 26 214	A silly collage for a silly person!
214	115 24 135 73 165 99 200 196 192 93 214	You in the mood for sushi?
214	116 121 78 67 25 66 94 80 26 132 214	Which way do I go, nobody knows!
214	184 171 210 107 144 155 95 179 96 88 214	They both would rather be looking at anything but each other.  Must be married.
214	207 46 54 189 128 171 60 123 52 16 214	This reminds me of Alice in Wonderland at tea time with all those crazy adventures of hers!
214	158 209 147 85 144 36 173 16 190 126 214	They were awesome!
214	13 147 85 11 78 24 186 168 14 67 214	loving the colour yellow.
214	89 198 71 146 213 163 108 120 114 212 214	Those sideburns look like a blast from the past! When was this picture taken.
214	121 215 131 198 86 119 43 208 124 185 214	They are gonna start a fight
214	71 27 197 150 29 43 180 28 212 129 214	Place where people work
214	66 100 181 164 43 200 114 107 175 10 214	I think it's funny he fell asleep with the baby!
214	195 3 181 55 178 176 25 156 32 82 214	I bet he stayed in the air foreeeeever
214	113 146 19 3 64 145 120 147 78 57 214	Check it out a tree grows in Brooklyn!
214	164 212 157 90 20 142 152 3 118 71 214	A bike ride-- how fun!
214	170 27 99 110 131 195 4 173 114 11 214	These guys all look like pokemon I want to catch them all.
214	194 160 15 173 191 7 73 159 79 53 214	Her hair looks great, reminds me of when I tried to give myself a bowl cut in 2nd grade.
214	176 49 38 46 207 40 52 35 27 192 214	The beautiful buildings are home to less than beautiful shops
214	63 160 189 82 25 52 212 1 106 20 214	This looks like a fun place to hang around!
214	197 80 151 100 120 158 123 176 91 187 214	Caption Nemo was tired of building submarines.  Gave kitchen design a try.
214	98 136 194 84 70 178 157 187 15 146 214	This place looks like Disneyland, I have never been but would love to go!
214	121 114 125 167 117 212 31 30 132 91 214	This seems like a really fun beach to visit. I could imagine lots of fun games to play there.
214	72 39 132 23 163 38 145 138 180 73 214	Yep this is definately where i passed out last week.
214	212 28 96 69 201 111 58 110 154 123 214	This photo is blurry, but i'm kinda into it.
214	106 203 137 197 63 200 128 78 39 64 214	Food looks yummy!
214	186 167 116 172 210 135 177 118 43 51 214	Can you think of an inappropriate metaphor for this? I can.
214	210 69 204 125 131 207 144 31 150 116 214	I asked the guy in the green jacket who he thought he was. He answered with, "Gnome body you know!"
214	160 143 104 156 124 103 172 70 88 14 214	He looks like he's about to launch that trombone into the audience!
215	60 160 64 176 98 165 33 144 57 3 215	This flower will grow like us and become something beautiful.
215	176 12 151 38 92 54 113 72 108 203 215	Some days I wish I was a mermaid and could live with, and maybe eat all the wonderful sea creatures. At least crabs and lobsters.
215	116 210 70 77 160 163 144 53 184 102 215	Ahhhh mauve, I love this color, I want it on my dinning room walls, or maybe the bedroom. Or maybe my she-shed. It would go so well with the shabby chic decor I have in mind.
215	48 58 31 6 193 22 109 80 98 103 215	Oh to be young, careless, and full of life. I long for the good old days when I was young.
215	199 198 178 206 88 92 15 139 61 58 215	Ahhh. Heaven on earth. Looking forward to what tomorrow brings.
215	65 118 51 151 214 203 93 154 153 213 215	Think of all the nice parties that could happen here
215	56 46 210 157 29 101 127 170 184 153 215	I can feel the warm sun above while I float along the path to the castle.
215	45 59 97 66 154 76 204 38 51 104 215	A nice looking night scene
215	107 163 18 67 59 103 202 194 183 115 215	Yes ill take the drink
215	209 189 29 133 84 156 76 13 160 61 215	These two are deeply in love.
215	26 21 206 199 151 154 148 165 191 47 215	Her hair is out of this world.
215	46 212 119 106 187 86 162 76 172 133 215	This looks like something from Narnia.
215	25 19 109 151 203 64 198 143 50 85 215	I cpi;d see myself taking my voes here.
215	172 132 193 182 101 3 211 160 167 41 215	These kids make me so happy, I want to have kids now.
215	198 89 194 3 11 139 40 160 76 102 215	I wonder who wrote those scrolls hundreds of years ago...
215	197 104 56 128 189 45 201 134 36 17 215	I can't wait to have beautiful kids
215	28 39 120 8 178 186 204 97 126 142 215	I love the way the sun is setting on the mountain..
215	212 198 119 207 15 10 84 54 60 191 215	This lady is very pretty
215	212 42 107 20 36 90 152 6 16 192 215	Are those feathers? So sweet. I wish I could be there
215	3 166 188 135 176 167 23 82 96 56 215	This family is the perfect example of a family photo
215	51 63 24 92 214 107 194 155 44 76 215	Hes got such beautiful eyes
215	18 93 180 63 27 164 12 22 135 55 215	Be careful with the wires.
215	142 154 97 117 51 26 34 89 62 70 215	I love being this high up in the sky!
215	97 107 5 86 128 188 203 204 150 189 215	I have the perfect life.
