27	16 3 18 7 23 14 29 25 22 19	I started a new job recently, but don't really know anyone there yet, so I am a bit bummed.

27	17 28 5 3 20 23 26 2 12 14	My husband took my girls on a father-daddy day trip the other day.  I had no idea how quiet it would be at the house with all of them gone - it was a bit weird.

27	5 21 30 14 6 19 2 25 32 11	I usually spend Saturdays with my parents since my Fiance works most Saturdays. Football season is coming up and my parents always get season tickets to the football games on Saturdays. It is really going to stink not having anything to do once that starts up again. I get to go to some of the games but the ones I dont get to go to I spend alone.
27	16 3 10 22 32 20 11 23 25 29	I moved out of my dads' house when I was 19 and moved to Atlanta.  The company I worked for moved all of us down actually.  But it was so strange being without my dad, or any family, around.
27	16 1 20 6 9 3 30 10 14 25	i really miss my family. it sucks to be 800 miles away.
27	24 1 9 28 10 12 7 8 32 5	My son is going to college in a couple of days and I'm sure the house will be a lot quieter without him.. I think the empty nest feeling is inevitable

27	2 3 8 18 22 20 32 4 12 23	Super sad today. It's the weekend pretty much and I have a hard time with loneliness on the weekends especially. I would prefer to skip over them during this time in my life.
27	21 19 4 31 32 30 16 26 5 29	My dog passed away a week ago. I live alone, and he was the only person that kept me company when I came home at night. Apartment feels so quiet and lifeless without him around.
27	14 17 12 21 29 24 4 16 10 20	i felt all alone yesterday
27	32 31 18 4 26 5 8 17 6 10	Once my friends started to get married and have kids I feel like I have no one to go out with on the weekends.

27	28 18 29 9 7 25 11 19 6 20	I was at the store and it was like I was the only one in there. I felt weird.
27	10 23 12 32 26 13 25 17 18 1	My whole family left me behind this past weekend. It was really strange to be all alone in the house.
27	18 26 11 14 30 7 5 17 3 21	It can be hard to wake up sometimes when you live alone. It's like..Oh...yeah. You know?
27	25 8 19 13 15 29 24 18 23 3	I remember the time when my grandfather died and caused a family feud. It made my life quite alone, with no one I can relate to because I was young.
27	21 7 16 5 10 19 6 2 32 17	The other day my friend cancelled plans with me and i was left with nothing to do except watch movies by myself.
27	11 12 10 24 16 1 19 15 25 9	When i was younger i didn't have many friends. Would just sit at my computer and was afraid to make friends. Was okay at time but just never felt good.
27	25 29 16 11 10 30 31 21 15 12	Just moved here for work, and I don't know anyone. My coworkers have families of their own.

27	10 13 32 15 18 24 9 7 21 8	No one ever visits me anymore. I am always by myself in this apartment.

27	15 9 26 18 6 30 19 29 17 22	I was walking home at night. I didn't see anyone else during the walk.
27	16 18 17 30 20 4 28 1 21 5	All my friends have moved out of state after college and I'm the only one left. I miss them and am trying to decide if it's worth it to move.
27	21 17 26 7 23 1 12 18 4 32	I have been wondering how it feels to be without someone
27	17 24 25 20 32 14 29 9 31 30	Every  Thanksgiving i eat alone.
27	2 6 11 13 26 31 12 3 21 23	i went to a concert myself because my friend could not make it, wish i had stayed home
27	11 31 17 8 29 10 9 5 4 13	I broke up with my boyfriend a month ago.  It was hard but he just wasn't right for me.  The biggest problem I have now is that I feel so isolated and lonely without him.

27	17 6 21 18 31 11 29 32 3 15	Some days I feel so alone as if I'm the only person on this earth.

27	28 19 8 13 20 2 7 1 17 26	At work, I am often the only employee in my building. Sometimes I get really bored and need to walk to one of the other buildings just so I can say hello to someone.
27	12 30 31 13 15 24 2 19 20 18	Sometimes I want privacy, but now that I have it, I miss my roomies.
27	32 5 12 25 16 7 20 21 22 18	I went to Europe last year, to watch a cricket match. But, I went there all by myself. I felt isolated.

27	18 15 4 9 12 32 30 13 31 21	My husband was out of town getting our new puppy this weekend and my son stayed overnight with his grandparents. It was just my infant daughter and I for a couple days. I actually kind of felt alone because she goes to bed so early and I had nobody to hang out with or talk to.
27	4 24 2 28 30 1 19 22 14 25	I haven't seen my boyfriend in about a week. Being apart is sometimes hard.

27	4 24 14 11 10 20 2 25 26 1	Yesterday was a very hard day, in addition to drama, I felt so alone. I live alone and don't see many so it can get hard on days like the weekend.

27	32 30 24 2 7 18 11 29 20 9	I was transferred to a new city. I did not know what to do on the weekends. I didn't have any friends or family. All my co-workers were married and lived in the suburbs.
27	15 10 2 3 9 12 14 13 5 16	Sometimes I feel alone even in a crowd.
27	1 3 6 19 9 10 32 31 12 2	I watch youtube videos all day because I'm so bored
27	13 8 21 32 23 7 30 10 14 12	when my girl friend left me i felt so alone
27	29 7 19 12 23 6 4 18 25 32	I was watching my son the other day and I'll watch him for two days at a time.  I realized in the second day that I really don't talk to anyone else other than him during the day, and needed to get out more.
27	15 6 24 23 28 19 32 18 7 31	I spent a lot of time alone as a child.
27	22 4 23 8 11 20 21 13 25 26	The other day I couldn't find my phone all day.  When I finally found, there wasn't a single missed call or text.

27	30 7 6 26 20 3 8 22 11 18	I just moved to a new city and I don't know anyone. I can't seem to break into the social circles at work.
27	18 23 28 13 2 10 8 7 11 21	Sometimes I have noone to talk to.
27	11 7 19 20 9 26 14 21 29 1	I feel lonely since the incident. The pigs are my only friends now.

27	12 24 19 31 30 23 18 6 16 9	I've been attending a new school for weeks now and I still don't know anyone. I'm so busy with the work I've been keeping to myself. It's no fun, I'd like to socialize more.
27	2 28 32 17 20 4 21 29 15 26	I just moved to a new city for a new job and I've been so busy I haven't really been able to go out and meet new people.

27	19 1 18 20 2 23 15 7 22 32	I moved to a new city and have no friends.
27	29 23 13 17 12 7 8 25 4 30	I have lived by myself for the past 10 years. It has just been me and my dog, but now he is gone. I can't get used to it.
27	20 3 24 18 26 25 23 31 2 17	I feel like I am going to be single forever. Every date I go on is terrible.

27	20 26 1 18 8 19 2 24 21 5	I just moved out of my parents house into my own apartment. I don't have anyone to talk to anymore.
27	13 2 4 6 29 3 32 5 1 20	i feel lost without my dog!
27	1 8 18 12 20 23 32 10 28 4	I can recall when my mother passed away I was very alone, literally. At 20 years old and an only child, you still need your mother. My father wasn't in the picture after she passed either. So I was completely by myself with a 2 year old toddler.  Very sad time.
27	1 25 11 12 26 22 13 30 14 28	I always thought that I would be happy to be an empty-nester.  However, as each child goes off into the adult world, I find myself wondering exactly what I will do with myself and my time.

But she's working hard to pay off her student loans and to build her savings, so I have to respect that. But at the same time, we're long distance, so the time I have with her when she actually isn't working isn't that fulfilling, either.

He found these old porcelain pug dog figurines that I thought about taking away from him. But as I saw him take them I just decided to let him play. It worked out fine, and he didnt break either of them.
28	8 10 20 32 5 27 17 1 30 31	I knew my friend was going to be able to pick me up from work. He was trustworthy

28	17 10 9 3 13 2 31 15 14 8	I stopped trusting people because of how I was treated last time I borrowed money out
28	9 18 1 16 14 8 7 2 3 17	I dropped money on the ground in public.  A kind and honest stranger saw me drop it and returned the money to me.  I trusted that person after that.

28	21 17 30 11 2 26 12 8 19 7	I was worried about getting an extension to submit a project I worked on for 6 years. I had been told extensions were rare and it was not likely I would get one. My boss told me not to worry, to keep working on the project with no funding and no assurance I would be able to finish. I believed him that an extension would happen and kept working instead of looking for a parachute.
