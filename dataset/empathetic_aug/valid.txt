We I arrived home, I realized that the employee had given me a larger supply of medicine than what I had actually ordered and paid.  By the time I had returned home, the store had closed.  I had to wait until the next morning to correct the matter, but I did go back to make the matter right.  It is important to me to be honest and trustworthy.  Not only this, but my son saw this display; and, thereby, I am teaching him to be both honest and trustworthy too.

29	8 14 11 18 7 4 10 6 25 13 29	Recently I've been a little stressed out because my toddler son has had such an attitude. My daughter is only 9 months so it's hard to deal with him being mad all the time as well as my daughter who has been sick. I asked my mother-in-law if she would watch my son for an overnight and she agreed. I felt so thankful to get a little break!
29	16 32 22 30 27 26 31 19 7 1 29	I hurt my neck today. I must have slept on it wrong and my sweet husband gave me a neck massage to help. It was so sweet.

29	28 31 32 13 11 25 21 10 24 17 29	I was running a bit short on cash last month and just got a nice bonus from work out of the blue. It really saved me.
29	15 31 14 16 11 3 18 9 27 20 29	There was a time when I was having financial difficulties. Someone gave me some money and food to eat.
29	2 16 6 26 4 28 21 9 1 24 29	So many people were rushing shopping for school supplies. I am glad I did that weeks ago.
